2.)	Entry verification 

	a)  Data Input Procedures:
The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each instrument 
on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10 datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger 
Program (nerr.csi) was loaded into the CR10 and controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The 
CR10 then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of 
the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  There 
are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly 
raw data file into an Access Database.  Second, it checks the data against a predetermined set 
of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and summary 
reports. 
Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in the Anomalous Data section.  
Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction section below. 
The most common error reported was for the wind speed less than 0.5 m/s criteria.  Other 
common errors were temperature changes greater than 3 ºC and precipitation differences 
greater than 5 mm.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

3.) Research objectives:

Data collected from the East Bay weather station will complement those data taken from 
the East Bay water quality station.  Positioning the weather station in East Bay will allow 
the Reserve to monitor changes in rainfall, photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, 
and other weather parameters influencing the water quality of East Bay.  East Bay drains the 
Tate's Hell Swamp area, which was altered in the late 1960's and early 1970's by timber 
companies.  An EPA grant allowed the Northwest Florida Water Management District to 
begin restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  


4.) Research methods:

There are no analyses, data collection intervals, or QA/QC plans for the WDMP in 
Apalachicola other than those expressed in Version 4.0 of the CDMO manual.


5.) Site location and character:

The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the northwestern 
part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located adjacent to the City of 
Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola Bay system, including 52 miles of 
the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay 
to the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.  The sampling site is located in the upper reaches of East 
Bay.   East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a causeway and is 
located to the north of Apalachicola Bay proper.  The bay is 8.2 km long, has an average 
depth of approximately 1.0 m MHW, and an average width of 1.8 km. The tides in East Bay 
are mixed and range from 0.3 m to 1.0 m (average 0.5 m).
  The weather station is located at latitude 29 deg 47.454' N and longitude 84 deg 53.004' W.  
This site is less than 0.5 nautical miles west of the Apalachicola water quality station.  The 
site is located near the tip of a peninsula, which separates Blount's Bay from West Bayou.  
The peninsula is dominated by marsh vegetation (mainly Juncus roemerianus).  There is a 
cabbage palm hammock along the southern shoreline of the peninsula.  The dominant upland 
habitat is primarily pineland forest to the northwest, which includes slash pine, saw 
palmetto, and sand pine.  
The weather station sensors are mounted at the top of a 3-meter tower.  The Tower is 
mounted on a 6' platform.  The tipping bucket rain gauge is mounted on a 4' platform 
approximately 15 feet from the weather station platform.  There is nothing nearby to shade 
the tower and the nearest wind block is the edge of the pine forest about one-half to three-
quarters of a mile north to northwest of the station.


6.) Data collection period:  January-December, 2001

The Apalachicola weather monitoring station was erected on August 27, 1999 and began 
monitoring on September 3, 1999.  The data submitted with this report encompasses data 
collected from 0000 hours January 1 through 2400 hrs December 31, 2001.  Actual module 
deployment during this time period began on 12/6/2000 at 1050 hrs and ended 1/17/02 at 
0825.

13) Other Remarks/notes

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

We seem to get a lot of relative humidity errors.  Usually, these occur in 150 arrays when 
the relative humidity reading will jump to 100 or fall to zero in one 15-min record and 
then go back to the range of values occurring prior to the error.  We are in the process of 
ordering new sensors and will have the current ones calibrated this summer.

During the storage module exchange on January 17, 2001 the wind vane appeared to be 
oriented too much to the east (more than 30 degrees).  Technician used hand-bearing 
compass and backed the vane up to orient as near due north as possible.  The orientation 
was then checked with Research Coordinator and other staff during the February module 
exchange and determined that orientation was correct at its present position.
