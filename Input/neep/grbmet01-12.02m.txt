Jonathan Pennock, Ph.D., Professor of Natural Resources, Director of the Jackson 
Estuarine Laboratory and the 
UNH marine Program, email: jonathan.pennock@unh.edu

2) Entry verification 
After the data is downloaded from the weather station, it is imported into the SWMP 
Weather Data Management Program. The data is QA/QC'd by the WDMP which generates an error 
report. The erroneous data are then examined and corrected or deleted using Microsoft 
Access. After the monthly file has been corrected in Access, it is recompiled in WDMP.


a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each instrument on 
the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger 
Program (nerr.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  
The weather station is permanently connected to a Dell computer in the lab. 
The data were downloaded twice monthly to the PC.  The CR10X then interfaced with the 
PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  

The following are common errors that occur in the data sets.  Values are flagged by the 
WDMP program if wind speed falls below the 0.5 m/s criteria or a temperature change of 
greater than 3 C in a 15-minute period or a precipitation difference of greater than 5mm 
in 15 minutes occurs.

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program 
(WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was developed 
in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  
The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and Access 
Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma 
delimited monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data 
against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it 
produces error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted 
below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in 
the Data Correction section below.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data at the Great Bay 
Estuary in order to aid with the interpretation of changes in water quality.

4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and 
daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric 
pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken 
every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150.   A two-week sampling interval was 
chosen so that the CR10X datalogger would not run out of memory and overwrite data. 
Periodically, sensors on the weatherstation are inspected for damage or debris.  If any 
is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned. Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell 
Scientific for calibration at minimum of every three years. 

5) Site location and character:

The GBNERR weather station is located on the roof of the University of New Hampshire's 
Jackson Estuarine Laboratory.  The lab is located on the shore of the Great Bay Estuary 
at Adams Point, which divides the Little Bay and Great Bay portions of the Estuary.   The 
latitude and Longitude are as follows: N 43º 08.063  W 070º 54.576
Approximate distance of the weather station are as follows:
From the 
	Great Bay sonde: 1 mile
	Squamscott River sonde: 2 miles
	Lamprey River sonde: 2.5 miles
	Oyster River sonde: 4 miles
	Portsmouth Harbor sonde: 6 miles

The rooftop at Jackson lab is approximately 30 ft above ground and approximately 45 ft 
above mean high water.  The roof is tar with embedded light colored stones which provides 
a generally reflective surface that does not absorb and radiate excessive heat.  The 
CR10X datalogger, air temperature and relative humidity sensors are attached to the lower 
portion a three-meter tower mounted on the roof.  The rain gauge is affixed to 
a gable that rises approximately 3' above the roof line.  The light sensor and wind speed 
and direction sensors are attached at either end of a "T " mounted on top of the tower.  
There is minimal blocking and shading due to the mounting height of the instruments.  


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected at the Great Bay site since April 1997.
This metadata document covers the period of time from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 
2002.

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The weather data is used by a number of University and State agency scientists conducting 
biological, physical and chemical projects in the estuarine and near shore environments.  
The data is used by the SWMP program to assist in the interpretation of short and long 
term changes in water column conditions.  Some general examples include 1) using rainfall 
data to understand changes in salinity, 2) using wind speed and direction to understand 
changes in turbidity and 3) using PAR data to understand changes in fluorescence and 
chlorophyll a concentrations.

13. Other remarks

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.
