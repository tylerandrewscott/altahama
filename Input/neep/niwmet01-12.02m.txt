2.  Entry verification

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute data, 1-hour average data, and 24-hour data were downloaded from 
each instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger (the 
CDMO Data Logger Program was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and 
data collection schedule (see Part B of this section for the data collection schedule)).  The 
CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific via a 
short haul modem at Baruch Marine Lab.  This software was located on a computer to 
which the data was uploaded (every 5 minutes) via a short haul modem to a computer 
located at Baruch Marine Lab.  The data was saved as a monthly raw data file (RAW 
0101.dat) onto a separate hard drive and backed up onto the Baruch Marine Lab server.  
Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) converted the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see Part 
B of this section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input 
and convert the monthly raw data file into an Access Database. There are three main 
steps the WDMP performs. First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file 
into an Access Database. Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error 
criteria (see Part C of this section). Finally, it produces error and summary reports. Any 
anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any 
data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction section below.  
Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s 
criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15-minute period, and precipitation 
difference of greater than 5mm in 15 minutes.  All errors of these types were double 
checked with other data that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted 
in the sections that follow.  Data corrections were performed on some 24-hour maximum 
and minimum values due to problems further described in that section.  Both raw data 
files and Access databases were saved to Compact Disc for archival and backed-up on the 
server. 

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3.  Research objectives (Campbell Weather Station)

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for North Inlet-Winyah 
Bay in order to observe any environmental changes or trends over time.  The data is also 
used to complement other biological, chemical, or physical research conducted 
throughout the reserve, including YSI data. 

4.	Research methods:
The weather station is located at the end of Oyster Landing pier with the Wind Sentry, 
Temperature and Humidity sensor, Barometric Sensor and Eppley Pyranometer all 
located on the approximately 3.5 m aluminum tower following the descriptions outlined 
in the CDMO Manual V 4.0.  The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge is located to the NE away 
from the tower and the platform.  The LiCor Sensor is located on the far SE piling of the 
floating dock away from any obstruction.  The sensors were wired to the CR10X 
following the protocol in the Campbell Sensor Manuals. 

Samples are taken every 5 seconds continuously throughout the year.  These data are 
used by the CR10X to produce hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air 
temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed, and wind 
direction.  An instantaneous sample is also taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored 
as array 150.  A one-week sampling interval was chosen so that the CR10X would not 
run out of room and overwrite data, especially is the short haul modem link failed and 
data could not be sent from the datalogger to the computer.  If this were the case, the data 
would have to be downloaded at the storage module to a laptop or the storage module 
would be replaced and brought back to the lab for downloading procedures in Part D 
Section 4.5 of the CDMO Manual. All collected data is QA/Qced monthly with the 
SWMP WDMP.  Any error messages are further investigated and the data is changed (if 
necessary), noted as anomalous, or noted but documented as correct data.

Periodically, sensors on the weather station are inspected for damage or debris.  If any is 
found, it is repaired and/or cleaned.  The rain gauge tends to collect the most debris and is 
cleaned out at least weekly.  Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific or 
independent manufacturers for calibrations at least every two years. 

** Please note that when using LiCor data for 2001 through April 2002 there were 
many instances where the data were deleted or modified.  See the Data 
Anomalies/Data Corrections for specific dates and times.   If data are needed for the 
time periods when it was deleted, contact the NI-WB Reserve for raw data that can 
be used for trend comparisons. **

LiCor:  4/19/00 (J Day 110) to 4/3/02 (J Day 93):  The multipliers were incorrect during 
this period.  Apparently, when the new sensor was installed on 4/19/00, the 
multiplier was never changed.  The sensor was re-calibrated in March of 2001, 
but when it was re-installed the multiplier still wasn't corrected.  The multiplier 
was finally corrected on 4/3/02 for the sensor in use.  
	On 12/14/00 the LiCor sensor was moved off of the top of the storage 
cabinet (on the platform) to the Southeast corner piling of the floating 
dock (off of the platform).
	10/19/97 (J Day 292) through the present:  All values less than 0 are 
currently altered in the raw data to read 0.  These values may indicate an 
incorrect multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  
Because these values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that 
they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
	10/19/97 (J Day 292) through the present:  All values over 100% are currently 
altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super saturated 
air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.  

5.  Site location and character:
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in two tidal estuaries, North Inlet and 
Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, located 
approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type estuary (Pritchard, 
1955).  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous winding tidal creeks, and is 
considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed 
drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential 
watershed to the north.  The Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by 
Pritchard (1955) and composed of waters that originate in the Blue Ridge Mountains of 
North Carolina, is one of the largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It 
is located 14.4 km south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major 
rivers, which are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain 
approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  

Description of the specific sampling station follows:
Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat.  33:20:58; long.  79:11:34). The Oyster Landing monitoring 
site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area located at the end of the Oyster 
Landing pier which is also where the NI-WB NERR weather station site is located.  The 
pier stretches into the upper reaches of Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of 
North Inlet.  The sampling site is located approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of 
Crabhaul Creek.  The creek directly drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity 
can range from 0-32 ppt. and average tidal flux is approximately 1.4m.  The creek has an 
average depth of ~2 m MHW and average width of ~150m MHW.  The bottom mostly is 
comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus.

6.  Data collection period:
Weather data has been collected at the Oyster Landing pier since 1989.  The current 
weather station has been operational since 1994.  Data was collected for the January-
December 2002.

8.  Associated researchers and projects
The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project also has a station located at Oyster 
Landing.  The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for North Inlet/Winyah Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water 
quality over time.  Three sites were chosen; one to represent our pristine site and the 
other two to represent impacted sites.  The Oyster Landing site is located near the center 
of the Reserve and is considered pristine.  Debidue Creek and Thousand Acre are both 
located in waterways that receive run-off from heavily developed areas.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes over roughly two week collecting periods at the Oyster 
Landing, Debidue Creek and Thousand Acre sites for all of 2000. 

A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core-monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-nitrite, 
orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home page for 
further details).  Thousand Acre is our permanent monitoring station for the NERR 
monitoring program, but Oyster Landing and Debidue Creek were also sampled 
beginning in 1998.  These stations are also included in our NIW core-monitoring 
program.

A long term fish survey is also done at the Oyster Landing site bi-weekly.  Species 
present, total weight, individual weights and standard lengths of fish that utilize the 
marsh at low tide are recorded.  In the spring/summer/fall months, fish utilizing the marsh 
at high tide are also sampled.

March 2002
 
Anomalies:
a).  For the month of March there were several times when changes were made to the 
wind sensor program to try to correct wind directions greater than 360 degrees and less 
than 0 degrees.  Although the multiplier was adjusted several times during the month, the 
adjustments would only have changed the wind direction by a few degrees.  All wind 
direction data for March should be considered suspect because of this.  

b).  On March 7 (Julian Date 66) the wind direction tail had to be adjusted because it was 
bent and making contact with the weather station tower.  Data recorded while the wind 
direction tail was being repaired were deleted, however, data prior to discovering the 
problem were not deleted since we do not know how long the problem existed, therefore, 
wind data during the week prior to March 7 should be considered suspect.    

c).  For the following date and time an error message was recorded for wind directions 
greater than 360 degrees and less than 0 degrees.   Although the data were retained due to 
the small error (approximately 3 degrees), it should be noted that they are suspect.

b).  From July 14 (Julian Date 195) to July 24 (Julian Date 205), the weather station 
battery was not holding a charge.  There were many instances when no data were 
recorded at all.  Recorded data that were known to be affected were deleted, however, it 
is unknown whether or not data that were recorded during low voltage periods is 
accurate.  Although the data were retained, they should be considered suspect during this 
time period.  

Corrections:
a). Any precipitation data recorded between 8:28 EST and 15:50 EST were deleted and 
replaced with 55555 on July 10 (Julian date 191).    During this time period, the rain gage 
was being calibrated and recorded erroneous precipitation data.

13) Other remarks:

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

Winter 2002	OL pier used by birds during winter months resulting in lots of bird 
droppings coving weather station equipment.  Data may be suspect.  

1/03/2002	cleaned rain gage 12:20


1/09/2002	Power off at weather station 14:50-14:52 to test palm pilot.  At 15:18 tried to 
upload data with palm Pilot.  At 15:30 turned CR10x off and on.  Resent program-fixed problem.
  No data for 15:00 through 15:30


3/07/2002	13:40 JK adjusted wind direction tail.  It was bent and hitting the lightening 
rod.  Gave it a spin to make sure not hitting any more.  13:44 JK tipped rain gauge water bucket

3/08/2002	JK made sure wind tail not hitting the antenna-gave it one spin


3/22/2002	Craig Knox from Campbell Sci. phoned and suggested that we try changing the 
multiplier at line 26 from 720 to 712.  He has seen wind directions between 360 and 365 
with a Met One 034-A.  By changing the multiplier he feels the  problem will be corrected.  
PC208w program changed according to Craig Knox's instruction.  Program was changed, 
recompiled, and reloaded at 13:35.  Some data may be lost in the reload.

3/25/2002	14: 00ish Cleaned rain gage, may have tipped.   
		
Emailed Bob Scarborough  (RC at Delaware) to ask his advice about wind direction problems.
He phoned and suggested that I use the long leads length programming to fix the problem.  

PC208w program was changed according to Bob's suggestions.  This occurred during the time
from 15:50 to 16:03 with the program reload at 16:03.  

3/28/2002	Phoned Met One and spoke to Rod Ralston.    He said that the multiplier needs 
to be adjusted.  To do this manually spin the sensor to north to see real max value 
(will need to take laptop to OL Met station).  Divide 360 by the max value and take 
that number and multiply it times the .288 multiplier in the long lead length programming to 
get a new multiplier.  

			
4/1/2002	11:20 manually moved wind sensor to max value for direction.  
Got a reading of 363.21.

4/2/2002	Emailed Rod Ralston with more questions.  The wind direction 
value we got when rotating the wind vain was slightly less than the max wind direction 
from the data (363.21 vs 363.52).  Rod suggested using 363.52, however, he did not 
realize that we were only seeing this >360 with snapshot 15minute data and that there 
were not >360 for the hrly or 24 hr data.  Sent him an email explaining how we collect 
data (5sec, 15min, 1hr, 24hr).  Asked his opinion on how to get the best data.  

4/3/2002	Rod suggested changing multiplier.  14:40 changed multiplier for 
MetOne (SN X3121) from 0.288 to 0.285 

			360/363.52(max measured wind direction)=0.990 (correction factor

			0.990*0.288(old multiplier)=0.285 new corrected multiplier

			0.285 inserted at section 26 line 8.

Changed wiring info for MetOne from E2 to E1 for blue wire.  E1 is the correct position
 for where the blue wire is inserted (see section 26 line 4).

Melissa Ide discovered that past technician had used the wrong calibration sheet when 
she calculated the multiplier for the LiCor (SN 18206). This sensor has been installed
since 6/26/01 and has been using the multiplier for the LiCor Q26604.  We are unsure as 
to how long LiCor data are bad.  

To fix the problem as of 4/03/2002, the correct LiCor calibration numbers were used to 
calculate the multiplier for total fluxes:

				(1/C) x t

				C=calibration constant (4.66 for this sensor) x 0.604  (0.604 
accounts for the 604ohm shunt resistor)
				T= datalogger program execution interval in seconds (5sec)

				(1/4.66 x 0.604) x 5 =1.78

				At section 12 line 5 the multiplier for LiCor (SN 18206) was 
changed from 1.27 to 1.78.

All changes to the program were saved as a new program name ni_wb30h.csi and the program 
was reloaded at 15:07 and 15:09 (wouldn't connect the first time).  Some data may have been
lost in the program upload.

4/23/2002	Weather Station Monthly cleaning.   Power at CR10X  turned off at 14:35 DST 
(13:35 EST)and weather tower lowered for monthly cleaning.  Power turned back on at 15:15 
DST (14:15 EST) and program reloaded at 15:28 DST (14:28 EST).    

		After reload the yr for the datalogger read 01, not sure how long it 
was reading this, but it was corrected to read 02 –may have to correct this when going 
over the 2002 data.  

6/26/02		Cleaned weather station solar panel around 10:13 DST (9:13 EST).  
Rain seems to have kept other sensors clean.  

7/2/02		Danna Dowdy worked on weather computer to try to get data online.  
PC208w was off between 9:45 DST (8:45 EST) and 9:57 DST (8:57 EST). 

7/10/02		Rain gage calibration checked according to Campbell protocol (By 
Jennifer Keesee and Tracy Buck).   All rain data between 9:28 DST (8:28 DST) and 16:50 
DST (15:50 EST) should be deleted.  No actual precip, all tipping due to cleaning and 
calibration checks.   

7/11/02		Created a new program and moved array 113 info to the end of 
final storage area 2 (table 2).  New program named NIWB30i sent to datalogger at 
13:56 DST (12:56 EST).  Program resent at 14:40 DST with YSI programming commented out.  
Resent at 15:00, 15:05, 15:35, 15:42, and16:05 DST with YSI time intervals changed.  
Final interval set fo 2 minutes into a 5 minute interval.  


7/15/02		No numerics on weather computer at 8:42 DST.  Restarted computer at 
8:43 DST due to error message.  No data had recorded past 2300 EST on JD 195 (7/14/02).  
Resent CR10x program at 8:46 DST.  Battery volts checked and were reading 8.4353 (needs 
10.5 to operate correctly).  Checked weather station, turned power off and on at 9:20 DST
and resent program at 9:47 DST.  No numerics , so resent program again at 9:49 DST.  
Rechecked battery volts at 10:15 DST, they were up to 9.43v.  AT 10:34 DST volts read 
10.419.  Problems probably due to low voltage.  ? if solar panels adequately charging batteries  Numerics finally came 
back when battery charged more.  

7/16/02		At 8:48 DST CR10x not connected, due to low battery voltage.  
Checked volts at weather station with voltmeter.  Battery down to 1.73 volts in morning, 
solar panel 13.48 when disconnected from battery.  

7/17/02		Battery volts too low 

7/18/02		At 9:46 DST battery volts reading 9.41, cr10x was not connecting.  
At 13:30 DST  volts up to 10.854.  

		Power turned off at Cr10x at 13:42 DST to 13:45 DST to replace 
battery and rewire Barometric pressure sensor with red wire disconnected.  Program 
resent at 13:54 and new battery volts reading 12.296.

		Power off at Cr10x from 14:14-14:15 DST to check pressure wiring.  
Program resent at 14:24 and pressure still reading 599.88.  

		Power off at Cr10x from 15:42 – 15:44 DST to rewire pressure. 
Resent program at 15:53 DST, pressure still reading incorrectly.  

7/19/02		A 9:20 DST battery volts reading 11.642, pressure reading 600.00mb.  

		Power off at Cr10x from 9:56 to 10:01 to rewire pressure sensor.  
Program resent at 10:08 DST, pressure still messed up.  

		Battery volts at 10:29 reading 11.745 v.

		Power off at cr10x at 11:24 DST- 11:30 DST.  Program reload at 
11:38 DST.  Bar Pressure sensor working correctly once rewired.  

7/22/02		Battery volts reading 9.3992 in morning (9ish DST).  Spoke with 
Craig Knox at Campbell, he thinks our CR10X has a high current drain and suggests 
we send it in to be tested.  JK changed program to comment out YSI programming to 
see if it was draining the battery, but could not send since PC208W would not connect.  
Around 12:44 DST resent program when computer connected and battery volts 11.316.

7/23/02		Battery volts 9.4191 at 8:45DST.  Computer would not connect 
until afternoon.  Battery volts up to 11.109 at 13:31 DST.

Campbell.  Should take 7-10 days to be checked and returned.  Shut down weather computer.

8/9/02		CR10X rewired and program reloaded.  Weather data began 
collecting around 10:30 DST (9:30EST).  

8/21/02 	Program changed briefly to test YSI cable at OL.  YSI programming was 
commented out again after testing complete and showed that cable ok.  Program was resent 
at 10:29 EST with YSI uncommented and resent at 12:36 with programming commented out.

8/28/02	9:03 EST changed to program "j" with Table 2 execution interval
