2.	Entry verification
The data are uploaded from the YSI-6000 data logger using the PC6000 software.  Graphs 
are printed for an initial visual QA/QC check of the data.  Using the Export command, the 
.dat files are saved in the PC6000 software as .csv files.  Files are then opened in EXCEL 
software and edited by removing headers, footers, and spaces.  Missing dates and times are 
inserted into the spreadsheet and missing data are denoted by periods (.).  Data files are then 
run through CDMO Excel 5.0 macros that:  1) add periods to cells with no data points; 2) 
check for outliers; 3) correct date and time intervals; and 4) format the data columns to the 
CDMO standard.  The file is then printed out, and the data reviewed.  Data are deleted if 
they are clearly not possible given the specific site characteristics.  The data files are saved 
as Text (tab delimited) within the EXCEL software to be submitted to the CDMO via FTP.  
John Roitz was in charge of data management from 12/98 through 6/99 and Sue Powell has 
been in that position from 9/99 to the present. 

3.	Research objectives
The South Slough NERR Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program is designed as a 
Before-After Control-Impact Study.  The YSI-6000 data loggers are deployed within the 
South Slough watershed along estuarine tidal channels immediately adjacent to intertidal salt 
marshes.  The first station serves a reference site and is located in the Sengstacken Arm 
(Talbot Creek) adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural marsh.  The second station serves as a non-point 
assessment, management-treatment site, and is located in the Winchester Arm of the slough 
adjacent to a dike-removal/marsh restoration area (5.1 ha) and 4.2 ha of natural marsh 
(Rumrill and Cornu, 1995).  The purpose of the research is to determine if the restoration 
activities change water quality parameters in a measurable way.

4.	Research methods
Measurements with YSI data loggers are taken every 30 minutes over approximately 22-day 
periods at both stations.  Sonde cleaning and calibrations of the DO, conductivity, depth, pH 
and turbidity probes are performed as outlined in the YSI manual.  For conductivity and 
salinity, YSI conductivity calibrator solution 3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used without dilution.  
For pH calibrations, Corning pH 7 and 10 solutions are used, and for turbidity, Hach 
turbidity standard is diluted to 100 NTU.  At deployment, the data loggers are lowered by 
chain into protective cases constructed from 4"-diameter ABS plumbing pipe that are affixed 
vertically on existing log pilings driven into the mud.  Holes were drilled into the bottom 
section of pipe to ensure adequate tidal flushing and exposure of the probes to ambient water 
conditions.  The sensor arrays are held 0.5 m off the bottom of the tidal channels that are 
approximately 3 m deep.  The sondes are deployed and retrieved by skiff or sea kayak, and 
are out of the field for 24-60 hours for cleaning, downloading and calibration.  Post-
deployment calibrations are performed immediately upon retrieval to determine if instrument 
drift has occurred.  No field calibrations were conducted.

5.	Site location and character
South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-Pacific 
portion of the Columbian bioregion, from Cape Mendocino, CA, north to the Columbia 
River estuary.  The South Slough, located five miles southwest of Coos Bay, Oregon, is one 
of seven tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos estuary.  The two sites within the South 
Slough that are being monitored with YSI data loggers are:

1) Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W] 
This station serves as a reference site and is located approximately 6.6 km from the mouth of 
the South Slough estuary.  It is adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural marsh.  Tidal range is 
approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-33 ppt.  Freshwater inputs have not been 
quantified. 

2) Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project site):  
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 deg 19.216' W]
This station serves as a management-treatment site and is located approximately 7.1 km 
from the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  The site is adjacent to the Winchester 
Tidelands Restoration Project, where dikes were removed from a 5.1 ha area in 1996 and 
1998.  There are 4.2 hectares of natural marsh surrounding the project site.  Tidal range is 
approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-33 ppt.  Freshwater inputs are between 1-
23 cfs. 

Both sites are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to intertidal marshes in habitats 
characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera marina).  The primary contrasts between the 
two sites include differences in channel width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of 
the channel with regard to the predominant North-South winds.  The watershed above both 
sites is primarily second-growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial or residential 
sites in the watershed.

6.	Data collection period
	The water quality monitoring program was initiated in April 1995.  We collect data over a 
14-22-day period.  Occasionally, it is necessary for the data collection period to be a few 
days longer or shorter.  In 1996, the collection dates were:

Dec. 17 (14:00) to Dec. 31 (23:30):  All values except Temperature were deleted as they either 
exceeded the normal range of values for estuarine waters or showed no variation.  Temperature 
data were within the normal range of values so were not deleted.

SENGSTACKEN:

February
Feb. 20 (13:00) to Feb. 28 (23:30):  DO data were deleted due to considerable downward drift.

depth.  Meter not out of the water so data were not deleted.

Feb. 27 (10:00) and (13:00) to (14:30):  Turbidity spike.

March
Mar. 01 (00:00) to Mar. 06 (11:00):  DO — see Feb. 20 above.

Mar. 01 (11:00) to (17:30), Mar. 06 (07:00), Mar. 27 (19:00) to (19:30), Mar. 28 (00:30), and 
Mar. 31 (13:30) and (17:00) to (18:00):  Turbidity spikes consistent with high rainfall events.

Mar. 01 (00:00) and (09:00) to (14:30), Mar. 10 (19:00) to (22:00), Mar. 11 (07:30) to (09:30) 
and (20:00) to (22:00), Mar. 14 (22:00) to (23:30), Mar. 15 (10:00) to (15:00), Mar. 16 (11:00) to 
(16:00), Mar. 29 (09:30) to (13:00) and (21:30) to (22:30), and Mar. 30 (09:00) to (13:30):  Zero 
depth.  Long periods of low conductivity consistent with high rainfall events.  Meter not out of 
the water so data were not deleted.

Mar. 06 (11:30) to Mar. 20 (10:30):  The pH data were too low and were deleted.

April
Apr. 02 (15:30), Apr. 08 (22:00):  Turbidity spike.

Apr. 03 (16:00) to (18:00), Apr. 04 (03:30) to (06:00) and (15:00) to (19:30), Apr. 05 (03:30) to 
(07:30) and (15:30) to (20:00), and Apr. 06 (04:30) to (08:30) and (17:30) to (20:30):  Zero depth

Apr. 16 (08:30) to Apr. 30 (23:30):  The pH data were deleted because they were outside the 
normal range for this site and there were unexplained drops to near 0.  Also, variable DO is 
possible for this site.  However, unusually high DO values on Apr. 19 (15:00) to Apr. 20 (02:00) 
may be consistent with an event such as drift algae wrapping around probe.  Temperature was 
relatively stable during this time while Depth and Specific Conductivity varied with the tide.  It is 
unlikely that the DO probe malfunctioned because values returned to normal levels - data were 
not deleted.

May
May 01 (00:00) to May 07 (08:30):  The pH data and variable DO – see Apr. 16 above.

May 07 (14:00) to May 15 (07:30):  The pH data were deleted as the probe malfunctioned.

(10:30), May 15 (03:00) to (07:30):  Very low DO.

May 15 (08:00) to May 31 (23:30):  The pH data were too high and were deleted.  DO data were 
deleted because the values ranged from 14% to 230%.  While variable DO is common for this 
site, they were outside the normal range and could not be correlated with precipitation.  It is 
possible that the DO probe was beginning to fail.

June
Jun. 01 (00:00) to Jun. 05 (15:00):  The pH data were too high and were deleted.  DO data were 
deleted – see May 15 above.

Jun. 05 (15:30) to Jun. 16 (10:00):  DO and Turbidity data were deleted due to probe 
malfunctions.
