2) Entry verification

a)	Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded from each instrument 
on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program 
(nerr30.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the 
Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W 
software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  This software was located on a laptop computer to which the data 
was downloaded approximately every two weeks.  The data was saved as a monthly raw data file (RAW 0100.dat) 
onto a separate hard drive and backed up onto the Rookery Bay NERR Lab server.  Once an entire month of 
data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) is used to convert the files to an 
Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERR Meteorological 
Data Collection Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  
The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and Access database.  
There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data 
file into an Access database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error criteria 
(see Appendix G for the CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data Criteria).  Finally, 
it produces error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in the 
Anomalous Data Section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction Section 
below.  

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria, 
temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15 minute period, and precipitation difference of greater than 
5mm in 15 minutes.  All errors of these types were double checked with other data that could support such 
"anomalous" weather changes and noted in the sections that follow.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank. 

b) Data Collection Schedule

i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives (Campbell Weather Station):

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for Rookery Bay in order to observe 
any environmental changes or trends over time.  Secondary objectives include using the meteorological data 
to help document periodic biological and environmental events such as:  fish kills, red tides, wildfires, 
prescribed burns, and hurricanes/tropical storms.  It also supports all research conducted at the reserve 
including providing valuable ancillary data for the reserve's water quality monitoring program.


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and daily 
averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind 
speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 
150.   The data is downloaded at the storage module to a laptop and brought back to the lab for uploading 
following procedures in Part D. Section 4.5 of the CDMO Operations Manual.  Periodically, sensors on the 
weather station are inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned.  The rain 
gauge tends to collect the most debris and needs to be cleaned out every few days.  Sensors are removed and 
sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at minimum of every two years.  There were no other 
analyses done on the meteorological data at present.  


5) Site location and character:

Rookery Bay is located in the Tropical Rainy climatic group of Koppen (1931), i.e. the area below a 
west-east line extending from Ft. Myers to Melbourne, and where the mean temperature does not fall below 
17.7°C (64°F) in the coolest month of the year.  Owing to the influence of the warm-water Florida Current, 
the seasonal effects from the Gulf of Mexico Loop Current, and its geographical position at 26° N latitude, 
the average annual temperature in the Rookery Bay  area is about 24°C (75°F).  Winter temperatures range 
from -1°C (ca. 30°F) to about 26°C (75°F), with cooler days and nights (10-15°C) in the months of January 
and February.  Warming trends in April and May are frequently modified by blustery winds from the 
southwest off the Gulf of Mexico, and by late season cold fronts with northerly breezes.  Summer high 
temperatures approach 35°C (95°F) or higher on occasion (Thomas 1974).

Rookery Bay and vicinity have an annual rainfall of 50-55 inches (127-140cm) per year (Thomas 1974).  
The heaviest average monthly rainfall, 8-9 inches per month, occurs from June through September.  Lowest 
average rainfall, 1-2 inches per month, occurs from November through March.  Approximately 66% of the 
total yearly rainfall occurs between the months of June and October.  Southwest Florida lies in the seasonal 
tropical weather belt that channels hurricanes toward or along the coast.  Historically, the area is fortunate in 
that few severe hurricanes have come ashore.

The weather station is located at Rookery Bay's lab facilities (Lat 26 01.492'N, Long 81 43.895'W)
with the Wind Sentry, Temperature and Humidity sensor, Barometric Sensor and LiCor sensor all located 
on the approximately 6m aluminum tower following the descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual V 4.0.  
The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge is located to the east away from the tower on the roof of the lab building.
The sensors were wired to the CR10X following the protocol in the CDMO Manual.  


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected at the Henderson Creek site since 1996.  The current SWMP weather 
station has been operational since September 19, 2001. 

7) Distribution:

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project also has a station located on Henderson Creek.  The 
principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data for Rookery Bay in order to 
observe any physical changes or trends in water quality over time.  Four sites were chosen, one reference 
nearly pristine location, Fakahatchee Bay, and three other sites representing various degrees of watershed 
hydrologic alteration.  Relative to historic freshwater flows into these estuaries, Faka Union Bay receives 
far greater freshwater, Henderson creek receives less total freshwater but increased freshwater during the 
late rainy season and Blackwater River receives less total freshwater.  Measurements are taken every 30 
minutes at the Henderson Creek, Blackwater River, Faka Union Bay and Fakahatchee Bay sites.  The 
loggers are deployed for two week intervals before exchanged with a clean/calibrated instrument.

A long term fish survey is also done in Fakahatchee Bay, Faka Union Bay, Pumpkin Bay and the 
Henderson Creek site monthly.  Species present, species number and standard lengths are recorded at 
four randomly selected sites surrounding the water quality stations.  

Benthic macro-invertebrates are collected near oyster bars using Hester-Dendy collection devices at 
Fakahatchee Bay, Faka Union Bay, Blackwater River and Henderson Creek locations.
