2.	Entry verification
The data are uploaded from the YSI-6000 data logger using the PC6000 software.  
Graphs are printed for an initial visual QA/QC check of the data.  Using the 
Export command, the .dat files are saved in the PC6000 software as .csv files.  
Files are then opened in EXCEL software and edited by removing headers, footers, 
and spaces.  Missing dates and times are inserted into the spreadsheet and 
missing data are denoted by periods (.).  Data files are then run through CDMO 
Excel 5.0 macros that: 1) add periods to cells with no data points; 2) check for 
outliers; 3) correct date and time intervals; 4) format the data columns to the 
CDMO standard.  The file is then printed out, and the data reviewed.  Data are 
deleted if they are clearly not possible given the specific site 
characteristics.  The data files are saved as Text (tab delimited) within the 
EXCEL software to be submitted to the CDMO via FTP.  John Roitz was in charge of 
data management from 12/98 through 6/99 and Sue Powell has been in that position 
from 9/99 to the present. 

3.	Research objectives
The South Slough NERR Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program is designed as 
a Before-After Control-Impact Study.  The YSI-6000 data loggers are deployed 
within the South Slough watershed along estuarine tidal channels immediately 
adjacent to intertidal salt marshes.  The first station serves a reference site 
and is located in the Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek) adjacent to 4.3 ha of 
natural marsh.  The second station serves as a non-point assessment site.  It is 
located in the Winchester Arm of the slough adjacent to a dike removal/marsh 
restoration area (5.1 ha) and 4.2 ha of natural marsh (Rumrill and Cornu 1995). 
The purpose of the research is to determine if the restoration activities change 
water quality parameters in a measurable way.

4.	Research methods
Measurements with YSI data loggers are taken every 30 minutes over 22 day 
periods at both stations.  Sonde cleaning and calibrations of the DO, 
conductivity, depth, pH and turbidity probes are performed as outlined in the 
YSI manual. For conductivity and salinity YSI conductivity calibrator solution 
3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used without dilution.  For pH calibrations Corning pH 7 
and 10 solutions are used, and for turbidity Hach formazin standard is diluted 
to 100 NTU.  At deployment, the data loggers are lowered by chain into 
protective cases constructed from 4" diameter ABS plumbing pipe that are affixed 
vertically on existing log pilings driven into the mud.  The cases were drilled 
out to ensure adequate tidal flushing and exposure of the probes to ambient 
water conditions.  The sensor arrays are held 0.5 m off the bottom of the tidal 
channels that are approximately 3 m deep.  The sondes are deployed and retrieved 
by skiff or sea kayak, and are out of the field for 24-60 hours for cleaning, 
downloading and calibration. Post-deployment calibrations are performed 
immediately upon retrieval to determine if instrument drift has occurred.

5.	Site location and character
South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-
Pacific portion of the Columbian bioregion, from Cape Mendocino, CA, north to 
the Columbia River estuary.  The South Slough, located five miles southwest of 
Coos Bay, Oregon, is one of seven tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos 
estuary.  The two sites within the South Slough are being monitored with YSI 
data loggers are:

1)  Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W]  
This station serves as a reference site and is located approximately 6.6 km from 
the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  It is adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural 
marsh. Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt.  
Freshwater inputs have not been quantified. 

2)  Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project site): 
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 deg 19.216' W]    
This station serves as a management-treatment site and is located approximately 
7.1 km from the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  The site is adjacent to the 
Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project, where dikes were removed from a 5.1 ha 
area in 1996 and 1998.  4.2 hectares of natural marsh surround the project site.  
Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt. 
Freshwater inputs are between 1-23 cfs.   

Both sites are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to intertidal 
marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera marina).  
The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in channel 
width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel with regard to the 
predominant North-South winds.   The watershed above both sites is primarily 
second-growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial or residential 
sites in the watershed.

6.	Data collection period
	We attempt to collect data over a 22-day period.  Occasionally, it is 
necessary for the data collection period to be a few days longer or shorter.  In 
1998, the collection dates were:
							Winchester:					
		Sengstacken:
							12/17/97 to 1/8/98			
		12/17/97 to 1/8/98
							1/14/98 to 1/31/98			
		1/8/98 to 1/30/98
							2/6/98 to 2/27/98				
		4/24/98 to 4/27/98
							3/9/98 to 4/2/98				
		4/28/98 to 5/22/98
							7/12/98 to 7/17/98			
		5/26/98 to 5/28/98
							7/17/98 to 8/8/98				
		11/3/98 to 12/2/98
							11/4/98 to 12/2/98			
		12/5/98 to 1/4/99
							12/4/98 to 1/4/99

7.	Associated researchers and projects
The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State 
of Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the 
OR Department of Land Conservation and Development and the OR Department of 
Environmental Quality in July 1995.

10.	Data anomalies
	
WINCHESTER:       
January
Jan 1 (00:00) to Jan 8 (13:00):  All values except temperature were deleted. 
They either exceeded the normal range of values for estuarine waters or showed 
no variation.  Temperature data were within the normal range of values so was 
not deleted. 

Jan 14 (14:00) to Jan 31 (01:30):  Time stamp was off so 15 minutes was 
subtracted to return to whole and half hours.  DO data are suspect as they are 
high - none of the values are below 100% as would be expected at this site and 
the values increase during deployment.  However, no post-deployment calibration 
was recorded, so data were not deleted.  Low salinities are consistent with 
high rainfall events.

Jan 28 (19:00-20:00) Depth negative.

February
Feb. 06 (07:30) to Feb. 27 (03:30):  All data were deleted, as there was no 
tidal variation evident and the values were outside expected values for this 
site (see missing data section).

March
Mar. 12 (12:00) to March 31 (23:30):  All pH data were deleted, as they were too 
low, possibly due to poor calibration.  DO data showed less variation than 
expected but because they were within expected range and no calibration 
information was available, the data were not deleted.

April
Apr. 1 (00:00) to April 2 (8:30):  All pH data were deleted – see Mar. 12 above.

July
Jul. 12 (18:30) to July 17 (11:30):  DO data were deleted because they exceeded 
the normal range of values for estuarine waters.  Temp, specific conductivity, 
and depth were all within normal ranges.  The original .csv file was corrupted 
and a new .csv was exported from the .dat file in EcoWatch.

Jul. 17 (14:00) to July 31 (23:30):  DO data were deleted because the recording 
began at 140% and drifted linearly down to 45% with no tidal cycling obvious.  
Temp, specific conductivity, and depth were all within normal ranges.  A new 
.csv file was exported as above.

August
Aug. 01 (00:00) to August 08 (14:30):  See Jul. 17 above.  

November
Nov. 04 (13:00) to November 30 (23:30):  DO data are high but reflect tidal 
variation.  Reconditioned DO sensor was deployed, but during calibration, the DO 
charge was out of range (99.2).  Data were not deleted.  Impact of high monthly 
rainfall can be seen in conductivity data.

December
Dec. 05 (16:00) to Dec. 31(23:30):  DO data were deleted, as they did not 
reflect tidal variation expected for this site.

SENGSTACKEN:
January 
Jan. 01 (00:00) to Jan. 08 (13:00):  Turbidity data were deleted as no probe was 
deployed.  pH data were too low for this site and there was no post-calibration 
record, so data were deleted.  

Jan. 01 (19:30) to (23:00) and Jan. 02 (20:30) to Jan. 03 (00:00):  Negative 
depth.  No post-calibration – data were not deleted.
 
Jan. 09 (10:00) to Jan. 30 (07:30):  pH data deleted as they did not show normal 
variation for this site.  Long periods of low specific conductivity and depth 
correspond to neap tide series and precipitation events from Jan. 20-23.

Jan. 09 (17:30) to (18:30):  Negative depth.  No post-calibration.

Jan. 10 (09:30) to (11:00), Jan. 11 (09:30) to (11:30), Jan. 12 (10:30) to 
(12:30), Jan. 13 (11:00) to (13:00), and Jan 14 (04:30) to (06:30):  High 
salinity, but possible for this area. 

Jan. 28 (18:00) to (21:30):  Negative depth.

April
Apr. 24 (11:30) to Apr. 27 (07:00):  All data were deleted as levels showed 
little variation and were not within values expected for this site (see missing 
data section).

Apr. 28 (03:30) to Apr. 30 (23:30):  All data were deleted as levels showed 
little variation and were not within values expected for this site (see missing 
data section).

May
May 01 (00:00) to May 22 (03:30):  All data were deleted as levels showed little 
variation and were not within values expected for this site (see missing data 
section).

November
Nov. 03 (13:00) to Nov. 30 (15:30):  All data but depth were deleted.  The 
temperature probe malfunctioned, so all temperature, conductivity, and salinity 
data were deleted.  The DO charge and gain were both out of range (88.0 and 
1.86, respectively), which led to rapidly fluctuating DO values.  This data was 
also deleted. 

December 
Dec. 01 (00:00) to Dec. 02 (15:30):  All data except depth were deleted.  See 
Nov. 03 above. 

Dec. 05 (16:00) to Dec. 31 (23:30):  Salinity shows effects of precipitation 
events.  DO slightly lower than expected, but no post-deployment data, so data 
were not deleted.

Dec. 27 (07:30) to (10:30):  High salinity, but within limits - conductivity 
cell constant out of range during calibration (10.4).  No post-calibration data.  
No field calibration.
