2. Entry verification
	These data were directly downloaded from the YSI 6600 data-sonde to the 
PC6000 software on a Dell Optiplex GX100 and a Dell Optiplex GX300.  The data 
were graphed and printed using the PC6000 software and then exported to 
Microsoft Excel.  Charting and plotting routines within PC6000 and Excel were 
used to verify the accuracy of the data.  In addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros 
provided by the CDMO were used to format and check the dataset for outliers 
beyond what the probes measure.  Outliers and erroneous data were checked 
manually using the protocol defined in Appendix B of CDMO Operations Manual (v. 
4.0). The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow 
PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a 
two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.  
Finally, an additional screening protocol, designed by Mike Shirley was 
used to identify outliers based on site-specific knowledge of expected parameter 
values. This protocol uses a Microsoft Excel template to flag "unusual" values 
to be examined more closely.  Values greater than or less than 1 standard 
deviation of historic values for this region are flagged as unusual. These 
outliers are eliminated only when the post-calibration results or the values of 
manually recorded "spot" checks of the water quality measurements during data-
logger retrieval indicate equipment malfunction.  The water quality specialist 
performs all data verification and screening.

3. Research objectives
Beginning January 1, 2001, two stations, Lower Henderson Creek and Middle 
Blackwater River were designated as the Reserve's permanent SWMP sites.  With 
the exception of turbidity, the dataset at these stations is nearly continuous 
beginning in April of 1996.  The dataset from these monitoring stations 
represents the longest record of continuous water quality measurements of all 
the Rookery Bay NERR water quality stations.  In January 2002 two additional 
sites, Faka Union Bay and Fakahatchee Bay, were designated as SWMP water quality 
stations.  All stations log temperature, turbidity, salinity, pH, dissolved 
oxygen and depth at 30-minute intervals. 
These four stations are in estuaries with watersheds having different patterns 
of landuse.  Their placement addresses priority resource management issues that 
are identified in the Reserve's management plan.  Specifically, the data from 
these stations are providing valuable information concerning the affects of 
landuse activities on the quantity, quality and timing of freshwater inflow into 
the Reserve.  
The Lower Henderson Creek station receives most of its freshwater from a canal 
system that drains a watershed area with approximately 50% developed versus 
natural landscape.  Land use in the developed area is divided equally between 
residential and agricultural activities.  A weir controls most of the freshwater 
flowing into Henderson Creek.  The Reserve obtained grant funding to upgrade the 
existing weir structure in May 2002 to allow for an automated control of water 
release.  The dataset being obtained from the Lower Henderson Creek station, 
along with biological monitoring, is being used to develop a water release 
strategy for Henderson Creek.
Relative to Henderson Creek, the Middle Blackwater River station receives a more 
natural pattern of freshwater inflow and has a watershed that has 75% natural 
landscape.  Agriculture dominates the land-use activities within the developed 
area of Blackwater River watershed.  Based on modeling of historic flow-way 
patterns, the watershed draining into Blackwater River has been significantly 
reduced resulting in higher than normal salinity values.
 Faka Union Bay represents the most extreme condition of altered freshwater 
inflows of the four Rookery Bay NERR monitoring sites.  Forty -eight miles of 
canals drain 94 square miles of watershed intercepting freshwater which 
historically distributed to four Bays.
Fakahatchee Bay is a relatively undisturbed system. The Fakahatchee Bay 
watershed is primarily under Preserve status and has been relatively undisturbed 
from the hydrological alteration of the SGGE (Southern Golden Gate Estates) 
canal system.  The water quality data collected from this station serves as a 
reference for assessing the effectiveness of watershed habitat restoration 
projects in southwest Florida.

4. Research methods
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific 
conductivity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen following the procedures 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  A two-point calibration is 
used for pH (Fisher buffers 7& 10) and turbidity (0 & 100 NTU from Advanced 
Polymer Systems, Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution (YSI conductivity calibrator) is 
used to calibrate specific conductivity.  Dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % 
saturation.  Sondes are deployed for up to 2 weeks at a time. After 
approximately 2 weeks time the fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling 
period is set for 30-minute intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the 
half-hour).  The following physical water quality parameters are recorded: 
temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (mg/l), dissolved 
oxygen (% saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A post-deployment calibration 
is done after the sonde is taken out of the water using the same calibration 
protocol.  
 NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and the original data files are 
reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST).
Both sondes are housed within 4-inch diameter, PVC pipes, which are attached to 
"aid-to-navigation" pilings.  The pipes are oriented vertically and are attached 
tightly with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom portion of the pipe is 
open and sits 6 inches above the bottom.  Probe readings are measured 
approximately 6-8 inches above the substrate.  Thirty 2-inch diameter holes are 
drilled circumferentially around the lower half of the pipe to ensure adequate 
water flow around the probes.  Sondes are hung by plastic coated steel cable 
inside the pipes; the cable is bolted to the piling.  A 'kryptonite' bicycle 
lock is used to secure the sonde inside the housing.
	The sondes are further protected from fouling by restricting the openings 
within the sonde guard with plastic screening. The plastic mesh (with 1/8 in 
square holes) was attached on the outside of the sonde guards' circumference. 
Furthermore, the PVC is serviced on a minimum of a monthly basis, and replaced 
annually.

5. Site location & character
Site #1- Lower Henderson Creek (LH):

	The "Lower Henderson" site, site #1, is located at the mouth of Henderson 
Creek.  The piling (manatee caution sign) is located right of center (while 
facing downstream) of the creek channel, approximately 100 meters from RKBNERR's 
boat dock. The Lower Henderson Creek labeling is to clarify the site from other 
historical water quality stations.
Tides at Lower Henderson Creek are mixed and range from 0 m to 2.76 m (average 
1.06 m).  The monitoring site is located in Lower Henderson Creek, approximately 
5 km downstream of a four-lane highway (SR 951) that crosses the creek.  The 
creek is 5.8 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an average mid-channel 
depth of approximately 2 m MHW, and an average width of 239 m.  At the sampling 
site, the depth is 2 m MHW and the width is 600 m.  Salinities at this site 
range from 0 to 38.4 ppt. Creek bottom habitats are predominantly fine sand and 
there is no bottom vegetation.  The dominant marsh vegetation near the sampling 
site is red mangrove.  The dominant natural vegetation of the watershed is 
hydric pine and cypress.  Upland land use near the sampling site includes 
residential areas with septic systems.  	
Watershed activities that potentially impact the site include non-point source 
pollution from road runoff, drift of mosquito control pesticides, runoff from 
upstream agricultural areas and leachate from nearby residential septic systems. 
The amount of water released from this weir can sometimes mask natural tidal 
salinity patterns.  The historic Henderson Creek watershed is approximately 50% 
under public ownership and much of this protected area has intact cypress 
sloughs and other wetland vegetation.  Canals and water use for agriculture and 
human consumption have altered the hydroperiod of this watershed. Consequently, 
the Henderson watershed receives non-point source pollutant runoff from a 
variety of sources.

Site #2- Middle Blackwater River (MB):
	The " Middle Blackwater River" sonde, site #2, is located at the mouth of 
the river.  The sonde is affixed to navigational marker #17 within the river 
channel.  The average depth at this marker is approximately 2 meters at MHW.  
The Middle Blackwater River labeling is to clarify the site from other 
historical water quality stations.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with oyster 
shell matter mixed in.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of the 
river.  Upstream influences consist of Collier-Semonile State Parks boat basin 
and upstream agricultural fields, adjacent to Blackwater River's main feeder 
canal, SR 41 canal.  In addition, canals and roads built during the 1950's have 
caused significant disruptions to overland sheetflow reducing the amounts of 
freshwater flowing to this estuary.  Despite these alterations, the salinity 
fluctuations of this site suggest that seasonal fluctuations in salinity are 
more closely correlated to watershed rainfall patterns than salinities of 
estuaries with water control structures, such as Henderson Creek    Blackwater 
salinities range from 0-40 ppt and fluctuate with the tides and watershed 
rainfall.  The tide range for Middle Blackwater River varies between 0.2 and 1.8 
meters.

Site #3- Faka Union Bay (FU):
The " Faka Union Bay" sonde, site #3, is located at the mouth of the Faka Union 
Canal.  The sonde is affixed to a manatee speed zone sign within the main 
channel. The average depth at the sign is approximately 2 meters at MHW.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with oyster 
shell matter mixed in.  Mature red mangrove forests and spoil islands dominate 
the banks of canal.  Upstream influences consist Port of the Islands development 
and marina. The upstream water flow consists of an elaborate canal system.  The 
system is explained as follows:
	Structure					Type
Faka Union Canal Weir #1			     Fixed Crest
Faka Union Canal Weir #2		  Fixed Crest Raised with Gates
Faka Union Canal Weir #3		    Fixed Crest with V-Notch

Merritt Canal Weir #1			 Adjustable Concrete Blocks
Merritt Canal Weir #2			   Fixed Crest with V-Notch 
Prairie Canal Weir #1			      Adjustable Steel Plates

  The system has altered natural water drainage patterns into Faka Union Bay.  
Salinities range from 0 to 39.5 ppt and fluctuate daily based on water 
management of the water control structures.  The tide range for Faka Union Bay 
varies between 0.2 and 1.6meters.

Site #4- Fakahatchee Bay (FB):
The " Fakahatchee bay" sonde, site #4, is located at the mouth of two rivers, 
Fakahatchee and East River.  The sonde is placed in PVC  housing secured to PVC 
pipe. The average depth at the pipe is approximately 2 meters at MHW. The sonde 
is located within the bay adjacent to one of the Reserve's biomonitoring 
stations.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand, silt and oyster 
shell matter.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of the rivers.  
Upstream influences consist of minimal effects of disturbed freshwater inflow 
from the Prairie Canal, a part of the SGGE canal system, to the Fakahatchee.  
Minimal non-point source pollutants are possible from the culverts under I-75 
and US 41.  Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve and Big Cypress National Park 
manage the headwaters of Fakahatchee Bay.  Salinities range from 10-42 ppt and 
fluctuate daily with the tides and seasonal rainfall.  The tide range for 
Fakahatchee varies between 0.2 and 1.8 meters.

8. Associated researchers & projects
	 In 2000 - 2002 RKBNERR also had 1 other YSI 6600 station, using the same 
protocol, and recording the same physical water quality parameters at 
corresponding river mouth locations of Gordon River. This site is examining the 
physical water quality parameters relating to freshwater inflow and is grant 
funded through a CICEET project, "An Evaluation of a Sub-mitochondria Bioassay, 
MITOScan, as a Cost Effective Technique to Monitor Estuarine Habitat Quality". 
These units are deployed, serviced and calibrated using the same protocols.  
These data are also available upon request.   
	In addition, an annual summary report on the existing monitoring stations 
within the Reserve boundaries is also available upon request.

there was no evidence the other sensors were exposed to the air.  Therefore, the 
data for the following dates/times will remain in dataset:
05/13/02  21:30 through  22:30
05/14/02  22:00 through  23:30

Data for the following dates/times will remain in the dataset:
05/16/02  00:00 through  00:30

(d) Turbidity.  Several high turbidity anomalies occurred outside of the range 
of the probe (>1000 NTU). The following readings were deleted from the dataset:
05/20/02  10:30  1375 NTU
05/20/02  23:00  1309 NTU
05/22/02  07:30  1404 NTU

(e)  Turbidity.  Zero turbidity readings occurred possibly due to calibration 
error. The following reading was left in the dataset:
05/26/02  08:00  


 Site #3- Faka Union Bay:
(a) Turbidity.  Two anomalous turbidity readings occurred outside of the range 
of the probes (>1000 NTU). The following readings were deleted from the dataset:

05/22/02  15:00  938 NTU

(c) Missing Data.  Data is missing for the following dates/times due to 
servicing the PVC housing at logger switch.
05/09/02  11:00

(d) Salinity.  A significant salinity change occurred on the following 
date/times, possibly due to the sensors reading a freshwater wedge at surface 
during out-going tide. The data for the following date/times will remain in the 
dataset:
05/22/02  15:00 through  15:30

(e) PH. The pH probe was crushed by a stone crab during deployments. Therefore, 
there is no data for the following dates/times:
05/31/02 22:30 through  23:30


 Site# 4- Fakahatchee Bay:
(a) Missing Data.  Data was not collected due to programming error.  The sample 
interval was set at the default (1 minute) instead of 30 minutes, therefore the 
batteries died after 3 days and no data was collected for the following 
dates/times:
05/01/02  00:00 through 05/09/02  11:30

(b) Depth. A few depth readings were negative and/or zero.  However, there was 
no evidence other sensors were exposed to the air.  Therefore, the data for the 
following dates/times will remain in dataset:

05/31/02  12:30  930.4 NTU

(e) All Parameters.  The sonde was reading surface freshwater during low tide. 
Data for the following dates/times will remain in the dataset:
05/17/02  01:00 through   01:30
05/22/02  06:30 through   07:00

(f) All Parameters. Sonde was exposed during low tide, therefore data for the 
following date/times were deleted:
05/16/02 00:30 through 01:30

(g) Salinity. An unexplained isolated anomalous salinity reading occurred; 
therefore, the following reading will remain in the dataset:
05/17/02 01:00 15.8 ppt

05/23/02 19:30 16.9 ppt

	
June 2002:
 Site #1-Lower Henderson:
(a) Turbidity.  Two turbidity anomalies occurred outside of the range of the 
probe (>1000 NTU). The following readings were deleted from the dataset:
06/13/02  18:30  1632.6 NTU
06/17/02  23:00  1078.6 NTU

(b) All Parameters.  All parameters became suspect due to the sonde being 
encrusted in barnacles during the deployment period. Although the data will 
remain in the dataset, it is considered suspect.
06/20/02  11:30 through 06/30/02  23:30

(c) Turbidity. Turbidity anomalies occurred outside of the range of the 
probe (>1000 NTU) due to sonde being encrusted in barnacles during deployment. 
Although the data will remain in the dataset, it is considered 
suspect:
06/21/2002	01:30:00	1377 NTU
06/23/2002	08:00:00	1393 NTU
06/27/2002	08:30:00	1406 NTU
06/27/2002	09:00:00	1403 NTU
06/27/2002	09:30:00	1406 NTU
06/27/2002	10:00:00	1407 NTU
06/27/2002	12:00:00	1409 NTU
06/27/2002	14:00:00	1145 NTU
06/29/2002	14:30:00	1410 NTU
06/30/2002	02:30:00	1406 NTU
06/30/2002	15:00:00	1410 NTU
06/30/2002	20:00:00	1365 NTU

(d) Dissolved Oxygen. Three unexplained isolated anomalous dissolved oxygen 
readings occurred prior to the barnacle encrusting the sonde. The following data 
will remain in the dataset:
06/02/02  16:30  6.0 mg/L
06/16/02  00:00  8.2 mg/L
06/19/02  16:30  8.2 mg/L

(e) Dissolved Oxygen. There was a slow decrease in dissolved oxygen beginning 
around 06/28/02 due to a quasi-permanent mid-level trough over the eastern Gulf 
of Mexico which helped generate a full two-week-long period of rainfall, each 
day generating over a half an inch of rain. This data were retained. 

 Site #2- Middle Blackwater:
(a) Depth. A few depth readings were negative and/or zero at low tide.  However, 
there was no evidence   other sensors were exposed to the air.  Therefore, the 
data for the following dates/times will remain in dataset:
06/09/02  20:30
06/10/02  21:00 through  21:30
06/11/02  22:00 

(b) Turbidity. Turbidity wiper came off during deployment, data became suspect 
(see discontinuity in graph). Therefore the data for the following dates/times 
were deleted from the dataset:
06/22/02  13:00 through 06/30/02  23:30

(c) Turbidity. One unexplained isolated high turbidity reading occurred (<1000 
NTU). The following reading will remain in the dataset:
06/13/02  11:30  231 NTU

(d) Turbidity.  Several slightly negative and/or zero turbidity readings 
occurred, possibly due to calibration error. The following readings were left in 
the data set:
06/01/02  14:00  
06/03/02  03:30  
06/03/02  08:00  
06/03/02  09:00

06/04/02  21:30  
06/05/02  07:30  
06/05/02  09:30  
06/05/02  10:30  
06/05/02  22:00  

(e) There was a slow decrease in specific conductivity, salinity, and dissolved 
oxygen beginning during the month due to a quasi-permanent mid-level trough over 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico which helped generate a full two-week-long period of 
rainfall, each day generating over a half an inch of rain. This data were 
retained. 

(f) Turbidity. One high turbidity anomaly occurred outside of the range of the 
probe (>1000 NTU). The following reading was deleted from the dataset:
06/22/02 10:30 1409 NTU


 Site #3- Faka Union Bay:
(a)  Turbidity.  Several high turbidity anomalies occurred outside of the range 
of the probe (>1000 NTU). The following readings were deleted from the dataset:
06/01/02  04:30  1479 NTU
06/04/02  06:30  1571.4  NTU
06/16/02  15:30  1439.6  NTU

(b) Turbidity. Several isolated high turbidity readings occurred (<1000 NTU), 
possibly due to crabs among the sensors. The following readings will remain in 
the dataset:
06/01/02  02:00  93.6 NTU
06/02/02  14:00  98.4 NTU
06/04/02  19:00  456.8 NTU
06/11/02  09:00  96.6 NTU

(c) Turbidity.  Turbidity data became suspect (see graph for discontinuity), 
possibly due to fouling. Therefore, the turbidity data for the following 
dates/times were deleted from the dataset:
06/21/02  09:30 through  06/30/02 23:30

(d) Salinity.  Significant changes in salinity occurred at tidal changes, due to 
sensors reading freshwater at low tide (lots of rain). All salinity data will 
remain in the dataset.

(e) PH. The pH probe was crushed by a stone crab found in gray guard, therefore 
there is no pH data for the following dates/times:
06/01/02  00:00  06/06/02  09:30

 Site# 4- Fakahatchee Bay:

(g) All Parameters.  All parameters were deleted for the following dates/times 
due to improper deployment, resulting in the sonde being exposed during low 
tide.
06/09/02  21:00 through 21:30

July 2002:
 Site #1-Lower Henderson:
(a) Missing Data. Data was missing for the following dates/times, due to 
replacing the barnacle encrusted PVC housing.
07/08/02  10:30 through 07/18/02  08:00

(b) Turbidity. Several turbidity anomalies occurred outside of the range of the 
probe (>1000 NTU). The following readings were deleted from the dataset:
07/24/02  04:30  1155.5 NTU
07/31/02  22:00  1444.2 NTU
07/31/02  23:00  1444.1 NTU

(c) All Parameters.  All parameters (including high turbidity values) were 
suspect due to barnacles encrusting sonde during deployment period. Data for the 
following dates and times remained in the dataset, but are considered suspect 
(no distinct discontinuity in graph):
07/01/02  00:00 through 07/08/02  10:00

(d) Dissolved Oxygen. There was a slow decrease in dissolved oxygen beginning 
around 06/28/02 and lasting throughout July due to a quasi-permanent mid-level 
trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico which helped generate a full two-week-
long period of rainfall, each day generating over a half an inch of rain. This 
data were retained. 

(d) Depth.  There were discontinuities in the depth data from 7/18 through 9/5
and 9/5 through 11/14 possibly because the sonde was not sitting at the bottom 
of the PVC housing, perhaps due to heavy barnacle fouling inside the housing. 
The PVC housing was most likely removed for cleaning and replaced which accounts
for the unusually low depth from 9/5-11/14.    

 Site #2- Middle Blackwater:
(a) Turbidity.  Turbidity wiper came off during the deployment period; data

(c) Turbidity. Several isolated high turbidity anomalies occurred (<1000 NTU), 
possibly due to crabs among the sensors. The following readings will remain in 
the dataset:
08/02/02  18:30  484.9 NTU
08/04/02  15:00  223.2 NTU

(d) Missing Data.  Data is missing for the following date/time due to switching 
to new PVC housing. 
08/05/02  11:00

(e) Depth.  There was an increase in depth from 8/8-9/19 due to the clean PVC housing
that was installed 8/5.  Heavy fouling that builds up inside the housing impedes the sonde
from resting at the bottom of the housing, resulting in lower than normal depth levels.  

(f) DO.  Dissolved oxygen readings became elevated (>100%) during in-coming 
tide. Data for the following dates/times will remain in the dataset:
08/12/02  13:30 through  20:30

12.   Missing data

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration probes (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
Anomalous Data Section (10).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting data.

14. Other remarks/notes

a.) General weather patterns affecting the water quality sites:

January: Although slightly below long-term average moisture levels, two 
moderately strong fronts occurred during the first and third weeks, generating 
nearly and inch of rain through out the area.

February :  Drier than normal conditions continued through out the month, with 
the exception of two weak cold fronts in the second and fourth weeks generating 
only scattered rainfall to the southwest coast.

March:  Continued high pressure across Florida prevented any significant cold 
fronts in March resulting in the second driest March in 25 years.

April:  A strong upper level impulse generated up to 4 inches of rainfall in 
Naples on the 14th, and a few sea-breeze type scattered thundershowers also 
developed during the second and third weeks, resulting in above normal rainfall 
conditions along the coastal areas.

May:  Summer-like conditions started generating convective thunderstorms in mid-
May, although spatially variable.

June:  Summertime convective thunderstorms returned in regular patterns in June. 
Although there were no tropical storms, a quasi-permanent mid-level trough over 
the eastern Gulf of Mexico helped generate a full two-week-long period of 
rainfall, each day generating over a half an inch of rain.

July:  Summertime rainfall activities were few in July. There were no tropical 
systems.

August:  Near-normal hydrologic conditions prevailed throughout the basin. 
Although there were no direct effects from any tropical systems, a deep layered 
trough over the central Gulf of Mexico produced widespread rainfall across the 
basin during the last week of the month.

September:  Summertime convective thunderstorms continued to be active during 
the first two weeks, becoming less frequent during the middle of the month. 
Tropical moisture associated with Tropical Storm Isidore generated moderate 
rainfall during the fourth week.

October:  The wet-season came to an abrupt end in mid-October as the summer sea 
breeze cycle disappeared. Except for a three-day long rain event (12th-15th), 
there was no moisture activity in October.

November:  The effects of El Nino induced cold fronts in November brought 
significant rainfall to South Florida.  Hydrologic conditions were wetter than 
normal during this month. 

December: In December, the cold fronts were less frequent with rainfall amounts 
approximately 38% above normal for that month.


Note: Any time a reference is made to turbidity or depth data being negative 
and/or zero, it was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in 
the edited data file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none 
of these data points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them. 

Note: There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded 
small negative values (-0001). Because turbidity has a range of accuracy of +/-2 
NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted these values in any way.
