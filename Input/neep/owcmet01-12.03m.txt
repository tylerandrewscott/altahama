2.	Entry Verification

A.	Data input procedures

The 15 minute data, 1 hour average data, and the 24 hour data are downloaded from each instrument at the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger (the CDMO Data Logger Program was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection schedule (See Part B of this section for the data collection schedule)). The CR10X is then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific. The data are collected in a storage module and retrieved monthly and then downloaded into a computer containing the PC208W software. The data are also saved as a monthly raw data file (month01.dat) onto a CD.

From January through November, the files are converted to an Access database by the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP), after an entire month of data are available. This program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule. The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly raw data files into an Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs. First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access database. Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error criteria (See Part C of this section). Finally, it produces error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data are investigated and are noted below in the Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that are performed are noted in the Data Anomalies/Missing Data section (section 8).  Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria, temperature change of greater than 30 C in a 15-minute period, and the 
precipitation of greater than 5 mm in 15 minutes. Each of these common errors were checked and either accepted as valid or listed as anomalous data.

The new Data Logger Program (NERR_4.CSI) was loaded into the CR10X on 
3 December 2003 at 07:00. The raw file data collected after 3 December 2003 
(07:00) were exported from PC208W in a comma-delimited format (.DAT file) and 
opened in Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro.  The 
EQWin format macro was developed by the CDMO to reformat the header columns, 
insert station codes, insert a corrected time column and allow the technician to 
remove any pre- and post-deployment data from the file. The pre-processed file is then ready to be copied into the EQWin water.eqi file where the data are QA/QC 
checked and archived in a database.  EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data set outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure) and large changes in the data.  EQWin is also used to generate statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and reports of the data, cross query the water, weather and nutrient data and finally export the data to the CDMO.  Any errors or anomalous data are noted and further examined and either deleted or noted in the metadata.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data 
collected with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0 (3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

3.	Research objectives

The objective of this work is to record the data over a long time period for Old Woman Creek to look at long term trends and seasonal variability in weather conditions.  An added function is to provide the weather data necessary for researchers to examine the impact of changing weather conditions on 
the ecology of the estuary.  Since this estuary is a storm driven system and the source of water in the estuary is a function of both storm activity in the watershed and on the lake proper, weather information is critical when studying the estuary.

4.	Research methods (Campbell Weather Station)
   
 The Wind Sentry, temperature and relative humidity sensor, barometric sensor and the LiCor PAR sensor are located on a 10-meter tower following the descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual V 4.0.  The tipping rain gauge is located about 5 meters southeast of the tower. The sensors are wired to 
the CR10X in accordance with the sensor manuals.  
	         
The Campbell weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and daily averages of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and direction, and PAR prior to installation of the NERR_4.CSI program.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes 
and is stored in array 150 and 151.  The data are stored onsite in a SM4M storage module.  The modules are swapped at monthly intervals and the data are then downloaded into a computer for processing (see data input section 2). When the storage module is changed, usually once a month, the sensors on the weather station are inspected for damage and cleaned, if necessary.  All sensors except 
the rainfall collector are sent to Campbell Scientific for recalibration at least every two years. When the storage module is changed, a handheld Kestrel 4000 is run to provide a general check of the sensors.

5.	Site location and character

The Old Woman Creek State Nature Preserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie east of the City of Huron, Ohio. The reserve lies within the Lake Erie Biogeographic Region.  Old Woman Creek drains a primarily agricultural watershed with corn, soybeans, and winter wheat being the most important crops. The weather station is located within the 
boundaries of the reserve, due east of the parking lot at the Ohio Center for Coastal Research in a field that is cut annually or biennially. This ensures that there is no tall vegetation that would interfere with the weather station.  The tower is located within a fenced (6 foot chain link fencing) enclosure 
about 5 meters square. The enclosure has a gravel base. The coordinates of the station are 410 22’40” N and 820 30’ 29”W.  Wind speed and wind direction sensors are atop a 10 meter tower, while the PAR sensor is located off of the south-west edge of the tower at approximately 3 meters in height. 

6.	Data collection period

Weather data were collected from 1 January though the end of December, 2003.

7.	Distribution

   NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize, and publish summaries of the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program data.  The OWC Research Coordinator (RC) retains the right to be fully credited for having collected and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standard, the RC and the NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and fully acknowledged in any 
subsequent publications in which any part of the data are used. 
   
    The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only as good as the quality assurance and quality control procedures outlined in the enclosed metadata reporting statement.

government and the State of Ohio do not assume liability to the Recipient or third persons, nor will the Federal government or the State of Ohio reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for its liability due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.
   
   NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under general information link on CDMO homepage) an online at the CDMO homepage http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/.  Data are available in text tab-delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format from the CDMO.

8.	Associated research and monitoring project

The four SWMP data loggers are located within 1 and ½ kilometers of this weather station. The two sites were established to determine the role of the estuary in mitigating storm flow though the system and the impact of Lake Erie on the estuary.  Samples for nutrient analysis are also collected at these 
sites when the data loggers are swapped out.
