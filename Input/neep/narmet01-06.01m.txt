2) Entry verification:

a)	Data Input Procedures

    The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were 
downloaded from each instrument on the weather station to a Campbell 
Scientific CR21X data logger.  A data logger program (Pi6oct2k) similar 
to the CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr30.csi) was loaded into the CR21X and 
controls the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR21X then 
interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  
    This software was located on a laptop computer at the reserve to which 
the data was downloaded via a telephone modem.  The data was saved at regular 
intervals to a data file (mmddyy.dat) onto the computer's hard 
drive and backed up to a desktop computer, also located at the reserve.
    Each time a download was executed, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This 
program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERR 
Meteorological Data Collection Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP automatically inputs and 
converts the raw data file into an Access database.  There are three main 
steps the WDMP performs:
    First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an 
Access database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of 
error criteria (see Appendix G for the CDMO Meteorological Data 
Collection Error/Anomalous Data Criteria).  Finally, it produces error and 
summary reports.  Any anomalous data  are noted below in the Anomalous Data 
Section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data 
Correction Section below.  
    Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below 
the 0.5 m/s criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15-minute 
period, and relative humidity difference of greater than 25% in 15 
minutes.  No anomalous data was corrected for 2001 data.  Both raw data files 
and Access databases were saved to Zip Disks for backup. Patricia Richard 
compiled the 2001 weather data.
	The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for 
Narragansett Bay in order to observe any environmental changes or trends over 
time.  These data are also used in support of both water quality and 
biological sampling data.


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 10 seconds to produce 
both hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, 
relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind 
direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data 
is stored in array 150.   A sampling interval was chosen to ensure that the 
CR21X data logger would not run out of memory and overwrite data.


5) Site location and character:

The NBNERR consists of 2350 acres of diverse estuarine and terrestrial 
habitats ranging from open estuarine water to salt marshes to forested 
uplands.  The land holdings include 60% of Prudence Island, most of nearby 
Patience Island and all of Hope Island off the west shore of Prudence.  The 
Reserve is located close to the geographic center of Narragansett Bay in 
Rhode Island. The bay has a drainage basin of 1,800 square miles.

The weather station is located on Prudence Island, east of Potter's Cove 
at 41° 38.335’N, 71° 20.362’W. The Wind Sentry and the Temperature and Humidity 
sensor are located on an aluminum tower approximately 10m in height.  The Licor 
sensor is located on a shorter (3m) aluminum tower.  The tipping Bucket Rain gauge 
is located to the NW, away from the tower and the platform.  The barometer is 
located within the housing of the CR21X. 

Descriptions of the specific sampling station follows:
The Potter's Cove weather station is in a grassland area bordering the cove. 
This location is approximately 100 yards from a water quality monitoring 
station maintained by the NBNERR since 1995. The water quality in the 
cove is considered to be an adversely affected by boaters' wastes and storm 
runoff from urban areas. Locating the weather station near this site might 
help to determine whether meteorological factors further influence water 
quality within the cove.


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected at the Potter's Cove 1992.  The current 
weather station has been operational since October 2000. Data has been 
collected from January through June 2001.  

Weather data were collected from January to June of 2001.  An apparent 
lightning strike on June 17 destroyed the CR21X data logger which remained 
inoperable until the installation of a new CR10X data logger on 
February 6, 2002.

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project has a station located nearby at 
Potter's Cove.  The principal objective of this study is to record long-term 
water quality data for Narragansett Bay in order to observe any physical 
changes or trends in water quality over time.  Four sites were selected; one 
to represent an impacted site, two in open water (at both the surface and 
near-bottom), and one located in a salt marsh tidal creek.  The Potter's Cove 
site is located on Prudence Islands' northeastern shore and is impacted by 
boat traffic and storm runoff from mainland urban and residential areas.  
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a roughly two week collecting 
periods at all water quality monitoring locations throughout the year.

A Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS) meteorological station is 
housed in the NERRS weather station at Potter's Cove and independently 
records wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric pressure, and air 
temperature.  This is one of six PORTS meteorological stations in 
Narragansett Bay.  The purpose of PORTS is to support safe and cost efficient 
navigation.  Data is available real-time and the system is managed for 
quality control.

Volunteers from the Prudence Conservancy have maintained a drum-recorder rain 
gauge located at the Potter's Cove weather station since 1992.  The 
volunteers clean the rain gauge periodically, as well as replace the 
recording pens and paper as necessary.  The data are managed by the NBNERR.

13) Other remarks:

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

Weather data were collected from January to June of 2001.  An apparent 
lightning strike on June 17 destroyed the CR21X data logger which remained 
inoperable until the installation of a new CR10X data logger on 
February 6, 2002.

The 2001 data were recompiled and the metadata document revised in May 2003 
to correct problems relating to an earlier version of the Weather Data 
Management Program.
