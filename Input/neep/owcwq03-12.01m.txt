2. Entry verification:

The data were directly downloaded from the YSI PC6600 data loggers into the 
YSI Ecowatch for Windows program in the PC. The data were graphed and visually 
checked for any obvious outliers. Notes are made of any unusual data or faulty 
probes. The data is then exported as a .csv file into an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and spaces. The CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls macro was used to QA/QC the data. The macro 
automatically formatted the column widths to the correct number of decimal 
places based on YSI sensor specifications. It QA/QC the data file for missing 
data points and filled all cells without data with periods. It also compiled a 
list of all data that fell outside the stated range of the different data logger 
probes. An explanation for the missing and the deleted data is included in this 
meta data sheet.  The files were then transferred along with the associated 
metadata by disk to the CDMO.  The files are archived at OWC. Dr. David Klarer 
is responsible for both data logger deployment and data management.



3.Research Objectives:

Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two-week periods at 
two sites within the Old Woman Creek estuary- one in the upper reaches at State 
Route 2(SU) and the other near the mouth, just south of State Route 6 (WM). The 
data was initially collected at the 52-second mark due to the warm-up time 
needed for the dissolved oxygen probe. The data logger was instructed to collect 
a measurement on the 15 minutes, but it would not take a measurement until the 
52 second warm-up period had elapsed. As per instructions from the Centralized 
Data Management Office, the 52-second time stamp in the edited data was 
corrected to read :00 seconds to obtain a uniform timestamp throughout the 
database.  The purpose of this monitoring program is to document the role of 
this Great Lakes estuary in the Lake Erie ecosystem, particularly the estuary's 
role in mitigating storm flow that passes through it.  

4. Research methods:



The YSI monitoring program began on 1March, 2001 at both sites. The sampling at 
both sites ended for the year on 21 December, 2001.  Prior to deployment of the 
data loggers, a 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was bolted to a metal 8 foot long metal 
post that had been driven into the sediment.  Each pipe had 4 rows of holes 
drilled into it spanning the area of the probe guard on the data logger so that 
the probes would have direct contact with the surrounding waters.  At site SU 
the area around the data logger was dredged so that the bottom of the logger was 
.245 meters above the bottom prior to the first deployment in March, 2001. At 
site WM the area around the data logger was also dredged so that the bottom of 
the data logger was .239 meters above the bottom. The locations of the two data 
loggers were the same as in 2000.  Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity, 
and specific conductance readings are taken when the instrument is pulled 
at each site. The data loggers are replaced in the field after a one, two, or 
three-week deployment, depending on temperature and degree of fouling of the 
data loggers.  The data is retrieved from each data logger and each data logger 
is recalibrated (according to the directions in the YSI Operations Manual) 
before being returned to the field.  Conductivity, pH (2 point calibration), 
and turbidity (2 point calibration) are calibrated using commercial standards.


5. Site location and character:
Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the southern 
shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio (Latitude 41( 22'N; 
Longitude 82( 31'W).  Land use in the Old Woman Creek (OWC) watershed is 
primarily row crop agriculture, so pollution inputs entering OWC are generally 
associated with agricultural practices.  Salinity in Old Woman Creek is normally 
1ppt. or less.
	The data logger at the State Route 6 (WM) site (Latitude 41( 22'15"N; 
Longitude 82( 30'50"W) is very close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In this 
portion of the estuary, the creek is very shallow but extends over a large 
surface area.  The site frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie waters.  The 
bottom sediments at this site are silty clay.  There is no rooted aquatic 
vegetation directly adjacent to the site, although there is both emergent and 
submerged vegetation within 50 meters of the site.  The data logger is about .24 
meters above bottom sediments.
	The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) site (Latitude 41( 21'45"N; 
Longitude 82( 30'25"W) is very near the southern boundary of the Reserve.  This 
site is in the upper reaches of the estuary.   The data logger is sited near a 
concrete piling of the eastbound Ohio State Route 2 Bridge.  At this site the 
creek is relatively deep and narrow.  Although water direction and flow is 
influenced at this site by changes in Lake Erie water levels, this site doesn't 
have direct contact with Lake Erie waters. The bottom sediments at this site are 
silty clay.  There is no rooted aquatic vegetation near or upstream in the 
estuary from this site.  The data logger is about .25 meters above the bottom 
sediments at this site.


6. Data collection periods:

Sampling at WM began on March 1, 2001 at 00:00:52.  Sampling for 2001 ceased at 
WM site on December 21, 2001 at 08:30:40.  Sampling at SU began on March 1, 2001 
at 00:00:52.  
Sampling ceased at SU site on December 21, 2001 at 09:30:52. Specific deployment 
dates are listed below.

*As per instructions from the Centralized Data Management Office, the 52-second 
time stamp and 40-second time stamp in the edited data was corrected to read :00 
seconds to obtain a uniform timestamp throughout the database.

From 10/30/01 (08:45:00) through end of month data logger was 
collecting data at 15 hour intervals instead of 15 minute intervals due to a 
programming error. Therefore, data is missing 10/30 8:45:00 - 22:30:00 and 
23:00:00 - 10/31 13:30:00 and 10/31 14:00:00 - 23:45:00. Unless otherwise stated

on 12/11/01 (09:30:00) sediment was cleaned away from the data logger trap.

probe being above water level. There is no indication from the other readings

12. Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure when no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of equipment, 
elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to calibration (both 
pre and post) problems.  
For more details on deleted data, see Anomalous Data Section (11).  To find out 
more details about missing data, contact the Research Coordinator at the site 
submitting the data.

13. Post deployment information

End of Deployment Post-calibration Readings in Standard Solutions: Dissolved 
oxygen standard is 100%, unless noted. Depth is always 0.0 meters. The specific 
conductivity standard is 1 mS/cm. The pH standard is 7.00.

14. Other Remarks
High turbidity readings (> 1000) are very normal for State Route 2 and State 
Route 6 sampling sites. Documentation was not made regarding these high data 
points due to the regularity of the turbidity readings. If there are any 
questions regarding turbidity, please contact the RC at this NERR site.
