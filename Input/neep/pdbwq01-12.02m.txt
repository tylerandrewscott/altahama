2) Entry verification:

The data are downloaded from the YSI 6600s to a Windows based PC. Graphs of all 
data are printed using EcoWatch software and are examined for suspect, 
anomalous, or outlying data.  The files are then exported as .csv files and the 
CDMO macros are used for final formatting and a second check for outliers and 
missing data. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro allows the user to automatically 
format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro allows PC 
users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a 
two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  It also has a graphing 
capability that allows users to produce single parameter and missing data point 
graphs on a monthly basis. After formatting the data, some files are more 
closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro(r). Edited and raw files are 
archived on a PC hard drive and on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR. 
This process of entry verification was completed by Robin Cottrell for the 2002 
data. Final verification and this metadata documentation were completed by Robin 
Cottrell and Douglas Bulthuis.


3) Research objectives:

The Bay View Channel site has been set out to detect and monitor short-term 
variability and long-term changes in the south end of Padilla Bay. The Ploeg 
Channel site has been set out to detect and monitor short-term variability and 
long-term change in the north end of Padilla Bay to contrast and compare to the 
south end. The Joe Leary Slough site has been set at the mouth of the slough to 
measure the effects of tidal "closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough 
and to detect long-term changes in water quality in the slough associated with 
an implementation of a non point source pollution watershed action plan. 
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes at all sites unless otherwise noted in 
data anomalies. 

4) Research methods:

YSI 6600 dataloggers were deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical position, 
1.7 m from the bottom of the slough in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe with a metal 
bar secured at the bottom as a stop. That portion of pipe around the sensors is 
cut out so that only two one-inch wide strips of deployment pipe remain around 
the sensor guard to allow water circulation around the probes. The PVC pipe is 
attached to a steel pipe that was driven into the sediment. (This slough was 
dredged in the fall of 2000 so the area of deployment is much deeper than it had 
been the previous 5 years. To keep the data comparable the YSI is deployed at 
the same height relative to Mean Sea Level.) 
 
YSI 6600 dataloggers were deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview 
Channel. They were deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, 
except that the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes. To keep marine fauna 
from interfering with operation of the sensors "Gutter Guard" (a sheet of 
plastic 1/4 inch mesh) is formed into a cylinder to fit inside the sensor guard. 
The depth of the YSI was -1.1 m (depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the 
bottom along the sloping edge of a small channel draining the surrounding 
intertidal flats.

YSI 6600 dataloggers were deployed in Ploeg Channel using the same design as 
that in Bayview Channel including the use of mesh to protect the sensors. The 
depth of the YSI was 0.5 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a channel 
draining the surrounding intertidal flats.

In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, 
percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth, pH and turbidity are recorded 
every half hour. At the end of each deployment, the YSI 6600 is brought back 
into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Before final 
cleaning and recalibration a post-deployment check is done that consists of 
recording sensor readings in the standard solutions. The results of these checks 
are used to help evaluate the validity of the logged data.

All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 
Environmental Operations Manual for the 6-Series Environmental Monitoring 
Systems. For the conductivity calibration, a conductivity standard of 50 mS/cm 
was used. The pH calibration is a 2-point calibration using standard buffer 
solutions with a pH of 7 and 10. The KCl solution and Teflon membrane on the 
dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6600 deployment and the new 
oxygen membrane is allowed to stabilize overnight in water saturated air before 
calibration. A 2-point calibration is used for the turbidity probe and the 
wiper pad is changed prior to each deployment. The standards used are 
distilled/deionized water for zero and 4000 NTU Formazin solution diluted to 100 
NTU.

5) Site location and character:

General: Padilla Bay (48º 30' N; 122º 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern 
Puget Sound. The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera marina, which 
covers approximately 3,000 ha. Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, 
now covers about 350 ha of the bay. Tides in Padilla Bay are mixed semi-diurnal 
with a mean range of 1.55 m. Salinity in the bay varies from about 15 to 30 PSU. 

Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer empties 
directly into it. Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed is 
agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay. The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located. Major 
freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary come 
from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River to 
the south.

Joe Leary Slough Site: (48º 31' 05.3" N; 122º 28' 22.8" W) Joe Leary Slough 
drains land that is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture land with 
some low-density housing. The slough is characterized by high fecal and nutrient 
inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. During the 
summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m. During winter 
flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m. There is a dam at the mouth of 
the slough with twelve 4 ft. diameter outfall pipes that have one-way hinged 
tide gates. Upstream water flows out of Joe Leary Slough when water height in 
Padilla Bay is lower than water height in Joe Leary Slough (i.e. ebbing tide and 
low water). Some saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through the tide gates 
during high water, salinity at this site can vary from 0 to 30 PSU. The bottom 
of the slough is composed of very soft sediment, which is periodically dredged, 
most recently October 2000. The deployment site is on the freshwater side of the 
tide gates. The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II 
and differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's 
stated accuracy of ± 5 m.

Bayview Channel Site: (48º 29' 46.6" N; 122º 30' 01.8" W) Bayview Channel, a 
major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macro-vegetation. 
The YSI 6000 or 6600 is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel. The 
tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z.Japonica) covered 
intertidal flats. Bottom sediments beneath the deployment site are fine silt and 
clay overlying sand, depth at this site ranges from about 0.75 to 5 m. 
Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point source, agricultural non-
point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from agriculture, failing septic tanks 
and wildlife. The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II 
and differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's 
stated accuracy of ± 5 m.

Ploeg Channel Site: (48º 33' 23.5" N; 122º 31' 46.7" W) Ploeg Channel floods and 
drains intertidal flats at the north end of Padilla Bay that are comprised of 
mud flats and eelgrass beds (Zostera marina and Z.Japonica) in approximately 
equal amounts. Bottom sediments beneath the deployment site are sandy without 
macro vegetation, depth at this site ranges from about 0.75 to 5m. Pollutants 
entering the bay include general non-point source, agricultural non-point 
source, and fecal coliform bacteria from agriculture, failing septic tanks and 
wildlife. The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and 
differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated 
accuracy of ± 5 m.


6) Data collection period: Data collection was continuous from January 1 to 
December 31 at all the sites sampled this year. 

Deployment and retrieval times are listed below. The times indicate the first 
and last measurements made with each deployment. (Deployments using the new 
6600EDS sonde are noted with EDS.)

11) Data anomalies:
January 1-31, 2002
Bayview Channel
During the following periods the DO membrane was damaged so dissolved oxygen 
data were deleted: 
01/04/2002 13:30:00 - 01/15/2002 11:30:00 
There is no data at 12:00:00 on 01/15/2002 because the data logger was being 
switched out at that time. 
The DO reading at the post-calibration check for the deployment from 01/15 to 
01/31 was unusually low, 84.4%. This is uncommon for this site; there is no 
evidence of problems with this probe in subsequent deployments so it may be an 
operator error during calibration. An error of this type was discovered in other 
calibration checks done by a new tech that was being trained during this time. 
Therefore, DO may be suspect for this deployment. 
A small negative turbidity reading of  -0.1 NTU during the following period is 
within the accuracy specified for this sensor and was formatted to zero by 
Excel.
01/09/2002	14:00:00
 
Ploeg Channel
The post-calibration conductivity value for the deployment period of 01/15 at 
11:30:00 to 01/31 at 10:30:00 was low, 48.84 mS/cm in a solution of 50.0 mS/cm. 
This could be due to fouling in the probe orifice or compromised calibration 
solution. 


Joe Leary
During the following period there is no data because the datalogger batteries 
died during this deployment:
01/01/2002	00:00:00 to 01/03/2002     15:00:00
During the following period turbidity data were deleted because the turbidity 
probe malfunctioned:
01/14/2002     15:00:00 to 01/31/20002     23:30:00


February 1 - 28, 2002
Bayview Channel
There is no data on 02/26 at 09:00:00 because the data logger was being switched 
out at that time.

Ploeg Channel
None

Joe Leary
During the following period turbidity data were deleted because the turbidity 
probe malfunctioned:
02/01/2002     00:00:00 to 02/01/20002     12:30:00
During the following period turbidity data was high and erratic so it was 
deleted, this occurred during a period of high turbidity due to a major rain 
event on February 21 and 22 so may have been due to debris interference:
02/21/2002	18:00:00
There is no data on 02/22 at 13:00:00 because the data logger was being switched 
out at that time.

During the following period pH data was deleted because it was the first reading 
taken after a new datalogger was deployed and was the highest reading of that 
deployment indicating the probe may not have had time to equilibrate before the 
reading, other data looks good:
03/08/2002	11:00:00
For the deployment period of 03/14 at 16:30:00 to 03/26 at 14:30:00 the post-
calibration turbidity value was high, 112 NTU in 100 NTU solution, this is 
outside the specified accuracy for this probe, cause unknown. Turbidity values 
during the deployment of this probe may be higher than actual values.

During the following period turbidity data was deleted because it was high and 
erratic, cause unknown:
05/28/2002     14:30:00
During the following periods pH data were deleted because the slope of the 
sensor as indicated by the millivolt readings during calibration were out of the 
acceptable range:
05/22/2002     12:30:00 to 05/31/2002    23:30:00
The post-calibration turbidity value was low, 86.3 NTU in 100 NTU solution, 
which is outside the specified accuracy for this probe. This was a new model 
(#6136) turbidity probe and YSI eventually recalled them to replace the motor 
and lubricant. Turbidity values during the deployment of this probe, 05/22 at 
12:30:00 to 05/30 at 23:30:00, may be lower than actual values. 
Small negative turbidity readings of -1.0 NTU occurring intermittently from

Small negative turbidity readings of -2 NTU occurring intermittently from 
05/01 through 05/22 at 12:30:00 are within the accuracy specified for this 
probe and should be interpreted as zero. 
Small negative turbidity readings of -2 NTU occur intermittently from 05/22 
at 13:00:00 through 05/31 at 23:30:00. The accuracy specified for this probe is 
± 2 NTU and some of the low readings fall outside of this range but all negative 
readings should be interpreted as zero. This was a new model (#6136) turbidity 
probe and YSI eventually recalled them to replace the motor and lubricant.
The post-calibration DO% value for the deployment period of 05/10 at 15:00:00 to 
05/22 at 12:30:00 was low, 83.4%. The last reading pre-deployment was also 83.4% 
so it appears the calibration may have been wrong. Dissolved oxygen data from 
this deployment period should be considered lower than the actual values.

deleted, cause unknown:
05/01/2002	10:00:00
05/02/2002	02:00:00
High values for salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH on the night of May 25th 
indicate one or more of the tide gates was open and leaking marine water into 
the fresh water side of the dike.
The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 05/17 at 
10:30:00 to 05/30 at 13:00:00 was low, 49.07 mS/cm in a solution of 50.0 mS/cm. 
This could be due to fouling in the probe orifice or compromised calibration 
solution.

indicated the DO membrane had been damaged.
06/07/2002	09:30:00 - 06/30/2002	     23:30:00
Small negative turbidity readings of -3 NTU occur intermittently from 06/01 
at 00:00:00 through 06/05at 13:00:00. The accuracy specified for this probe is ± 
2 NTU and some of the low readings fall outside of this range but they should 
all be interpreted as zero. This was a new model (#6136) turbidity probe and YSI 
eventually recalled them to replace the motor and lubricant. The post-
calibration turbidity value was low, 90.6 NTU in 100 NTU solution, which is 
outside the specified accuracy for this probe, cause unknown. Turbidity values 
during the deployment of this probe, 06/05 at 13:30:00 to 06/20 at 12:30:00, may 
be lower than actual values. 

Joe Leary 
Twice this month the post-calibration turbidity value was low. During the 
deployment from 06/01 at 00:00:00 to 06/10 at 12:00:00 the value was 91.1 NTU in 
100 NTU solution and for the deployment from 06/21 at 14:30:00 to 06/30 at 
23:30:00 the value was 94.1. Both values are outside the specified accuracy for 
this probe. These were new model (#6136) turbidity probes and YSI eventually 
recalled them to replace the motor and lubricant. Turbidity values during the 
deployment of these probes may be lower than actual values. 
The post-calibration DO% value for the deployment period of 06/01 at 00:00:00 to 
06/10 at 12:00:00 was low, 91.6%. This may be due to biofouling, which is not 
uncommon at this site; DO readings (especially toward the end of this 
deployment) may be lower than actual values.

14) Other Remarks/notes
Generally high turbidities in Joe Leary Slough correspond to heavy rain events 
as on February 21 and 22 when a two-day total of 35.6 mm of precipitation was 
recorded at our weather station. At the two bay sites, Bayview and Ploeg 
Channel, wind is often the driving force affecting turbidity as on April 22 when 
both bay sites had elevated turbidities in the afternoon and wind average speed 
for the day was 5.4 m/s with a maximum gust of 17.3 m/s.As noted in data 
anomalies section there were problems with a new model of turbidity probe, 
#6136 (denoted in post deployment section with +). It would calibrate without 
error but post-calibration readings in a 100 NTU standard were often low. These 
probes were recalled for an upgrade to replace the lubricant and install a new 
wiper motor.
