2. Entry Verification:

	The data are downloaded to an IBM compatible computer from the Hydrolab Datasonde I, 
Hydrolab Datasonde III, Hydrolab Recorder, or YSI 6000UPG as a raw file.  The YSI 6000 data are 
reviewed using the YSI computer program PC6000 that accompanies the YSI 6000 data logger.  After the 
file is uploaded from the datatlogger, PC6000 is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical analysis 
(i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.)  This information is printed out and attached to the Field Log for the 
articular deployment.  The information obtained from this printout is used during file review to detect any 
gross outliers such as data taken when the datalogger was removed from the water or those caused by 
instrument failure.  Georgianne Coker, Research Technician, was responsible for the data collection, 
management, and monitoring of the three sites.  The data are imported into a Microsoft Excel file that 
contains the current month’s cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of data has been recorded the 
file is ready for review.  The data review includes several steps.  
The first step is to format the data so that the parameter columns are in the correct order and the 
data has the correct number of decimal place holders by using the Column Reformat CDMO Excel 5.0 
Macro.   Secondly, the Date Hour Count CDMO Excel 5.0 macro is used to determine if there are any dates 
and times that data was not recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  Missing dates 
and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where data would normally be.  
The reason for the missing data is recorded on the Water Quality Editing Log.  Next, the data are filtered 
using the Find Variable Outlier CDMO Excel 5.0 macro to find readings outside the instrument 
measurement range and the “normal” range for the site in question.  Data outside the instrument range 
is/are removed from the file and a period is inserted to the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing dates and 
times are recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.  Data that was outside the “normal” range of water 
quality for a particular site is investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, 
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  If the data is/are rejected from the file a period is inserted to 
the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto the Water quality Editing 
Log.  The information recorded on the Water Quality Editing Log is transferred to the Metadata form.  The 
Metadata form is the submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Stacey Webb, reserve fellow, was 
responsible for the data review.   

3. Research Objectives:

	The purpose of research was only to perform long term water quality monitoring and not a specific 
experiment.   Sapelo Island is only accessible by passenger ferry.  Due to its isolation, the salt marsh and 
tidal waters of the SINERR show little evidence of human impact.  The Marsh Landing site receives a 
large amount of boat traffic, as it is the primary access point for the approximately 200-300 residents, 
commuters and daily visitors plus barge off loading.  The Flume Dock site is a relatively isolated location 
compared to the Marsh Landing site.

4.   Research Methods:

	The monitoring program began in August of 1986 at the Flume Dock and Marsh Landing sites.  
The units are hung vertically from a float or floating dock so they hang two meters below the surface.  
Thus, depth was considered fixed and not measured.  Hydrolab units were used exclusively until May 1995.  
Beyond that point, YSI units were used as well as the Hydrolabs.  The probes are cleaned three times 
weekly during the warmer months.  No pre- or post-calibrations were performed.  The Dissolved Oxygen 
probes are cleaned once weekly with a cotton swab soaked in methanol, while the other probes are cleaned 
with cotton swabs or pipe cleaners and de-ionized water.  After two weeks the units are returned to the lab 
for downloading, cleaning and recalibration, according to the manufacturers manual.  Before each YSI 
PC6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed following the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Calibration standards are only required for pH, conductivity, and turbidity, all other 
parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 and 10) are 
purchased from a scientific supply house.  The conductivity standard is made using a 0.2 M solution of KCl 
(24.82mS/cm=14.92 g/L).  The turbidity calibration uses distilled water made by the University of Georgia-
Athens Marine Institute.  The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are 
allowed to sit at least 24 hours prior to deployment. 
	The datalogger is placed inside a length of PVC pipe attached to the dock.  
Every 30 minutes during the sampling period measurements are taken for temperature, specific 
conductance, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth and turbidity. 	During the stage of 
deployment the datalogger is checked for fouling and cleaned.  This can be one to three times a week 
depending on the time of year.  At the end of the sample period the datalogger is retrieved and immediately 
replaced by another calibrated datalogger.  The datalogger is then taken to the lab where the data is 
uploaded, and the probe is cleaned.

5. Site Location and character:

	The Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in a tidal estuary on the western 
side of Sapelo Island on the coast of Georgia.  The Duplin River, actually a tidal lagoon, that receives little 
fresh water and opens into Doboy Sound, ca. 5 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean.  The marsh is inundated 
twice daily by unequal tides with a mean range of 2.1m.  Salinity ranges from 10 to 25 ppt.  The 
surrounding area vegetation is dominated by salt marsh with Spartina alterniflora being the predominate 
flora.  There are two monitoring stations located within the reserve.  The previous Barn Creek site was 
discontinued as of January 1, 1998.  

1) Marsh Landing: located on the lower Duplin River on Sapelo Island (Latitude: 31° 25’ 4”N, Longitude 
81° 17’ 46”W). Water passing the Marsh landing site during flood tide originates from the Doboy Sound.  
The Doboy receives input from the Atlantic Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal waterway.  
The water is pushed up the river or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh surface by 
the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb tide.  The dock itself is used as the main dock 
to the island where the ferry makes several daily runs.  There are also several small boats that are 
docked there. 

2) Flume Dock: located on the upper Duplin River on Sapelo Island (Lattitude: 31° 28’ 58N, Longitude 81° 
17’ 3”W).  It is influenced by tidal currents which flood the marsh on high tides and recede into the channel 
of the river and its side creeks.  It receives far less boat traffic than the Marsh Landing site. 

6. Data collection period: 

	Data has been collected at the Marsh Landing and Flume Dock sites since 1986 for the University 
of Georgia Marine Institute.  Both sites started May 1995 for the NERRS SWMP.  


7.  Associated researchers and projects:

	Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the University of Georgia 
Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the island became a working laboratory for many.  Given 
UGAMI’s long history on Sapelo, a bibliographic list of over 800 articles of current and previous research 
can be found on the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/UGAMI).
