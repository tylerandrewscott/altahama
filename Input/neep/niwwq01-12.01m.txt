2.  Entry verification
The .dat and .csv versions of the raw data files were uploaded to a PC from YSI 
6000 or 6600 dataloggers. Raw data was uploaded and plotted using EcoWatch 
software. CDMO macros were also used in EXCEL 5.0 to identify anomalous or 
problem data in the files.  The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro allows the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro 
will allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel 
file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In 
addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro 
allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis. 

Comma delimited files are opened in Microsoft EXCEL 5.0 and edited by removing 
unnecessary headers, footers or spaces and any data which corresponds to the 
instrument being out of the water for maintenance.  Next, data plots were 
produced and examined for any anomalies using the CDMO graphing Macro for each 
variable. Suspect data were evaluated as to being either good or bad based on 
criteria outlined in the CDMO manual version 4.0.  If the data were 
determined to be bad, they were deleted from the final edited .txt file and then 
documented in the metadata.  If it could not be determined whether or not 
suspect data were bad (as was often the case with turbidity) the data was left 
in the final edited .txt file and noted in the metadata as anomalous. The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) and Turbidity (Turb) probes were the most problematic.  In 
instances where data values increased or decreased in an exponential fashion and 
or intermittently went outside the accepted range for that instrument and never 
returned to normal, the data was considered suspect, noted in the metadata, and 
removed from the final edited data file.  Missing data due to equipment failure 
or maintenance were replaced with periods (.). The date/hour and column reformat 
macros were then run on the data files before being saved in their final edited 
form (.txt).  Edited (.txt) and raw (.csv) files were then FTP'd to both the Sun 
Sparc II and the CDMO server and archived. The most current CDMO macros are 
available on the NERRS CDMO home page.  Jennifer Jarrell, Jennifer Keesee, and 
Tracy Buck edited and archived the 2001 data for Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, 
Oyster Landing, and Clambank Creek. 

3.  Research Objectives
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for North Inlet/Winyah Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality over time.  Three sites were chosen; one to represent our pristine 
site and the other two to represent impacted sites.  The Oyster Landing site is 
located near the center of the Reserve and is considered pristine.  Debidue 
Creek and Thousand Acre are both located in waterways that receive run-off from 
heavily developed areas.  Measurements were taken every 30 minutes over roughly 
two week collecting periods at the Oyster Landing, Debidue Creek, Clambank and 
Thousand 
Acre sites. 

4.  Research methods (YSI 6000 dataloggers)
YSI dataloggers are currently mounted in a 4" diameter PVC pipe which is 
strapped to a treated 2" X 6" board; and then attached via stainless steel bands 
to a piling at the Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, Clambank, and Oyster Landing 
sites.  The PVC pipe which houses the data loggers has two large windows cut out 
near the bottom for the probes to have direct contact with the water column.  A 
stop bolt placed through the PVC pipe below the cut out windows keeps the 
datalogger exactly one foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  Every 30 minutes 
measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, water temperature, pH, turbidity, and water level are recorded.  The 
two-week sampling interval has been selected due to biofouling of the individual 
probes and expected battery life.  At the end of each sampling interval, the 
dataloggers were brought back to the laboratory to be downloaded, cleaned and 
recalibrated following procedures in YSI Service Manual and the Standard 
Operating Procedures V3.0 provided by NERR SWMP.  Downtime for this maintenance 
is roughly 24 hrs. Before the instruments were cleaned and recalibrated a post 
calibration reading was taken from each instrument in fresh standard to see if 
any of the instruments exhibited drift (see II-13).  The pH probe was calibrated 
using a two point method and either 4,7 or 7,10 standards.  The turbidity probe 
calibration also used a two-point method using 0 & 100 NTU standards.  Specific 
Conductivity was calibrated using a one-point method and a 10 ms/cm standard 
which was purchased through YSI, Inc.  The turbidity wiper and DO 
membrane were changed after each deployment.  After approximately 24 hours of 
down time for cleaning and overnight relaxing of the DO membrane, the YSI 
dataloggers were re-deployed (in some instances the sondes are switched out 
resulting in less data loss).


5.  Site location and character
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in two tidal estuaries, North 
Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, 
located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type 
estuary (Pritchard, 1955).  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous 
winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal 
anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine 
forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The 
Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955), 
which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the 
largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km 
south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which 
are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain 
approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  Descriptions of the three 
sampling stations are as follows:

A) Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:17:57; long. 79:15:36) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek and is on the NW 
corner of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh (this site was relocated 07-19-
99 to the current location due to heavy siltation and degrading data quality).  
The present site is about 15m from the mouth of the creek.  At the sampling 
site, creek depth is approximately 2 m MHW and creek width is approximately 10 
m.  The creek empties into the northeastern side of the mid portion of Winyah 
Bay and directly drains pine forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 
0 to 15 ppt. and tidal flux is approximately 1m.  The bottom is most composed of 
fine sediments and detritus.  Georgetown, 5 km upstream from the Thousand Acre 
site and on the southern side of Winyah Bay, is the homeport for a number of 
heavy industries including a steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a coal 
fired power plant.  A public sewage treatment plant, which discharges into the 
bay, is also located in Georgetown.

B) Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat.  33:20:58; long.  79:11:34). The Oyster Landing 
monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area located at 
the end of the Oyster Landing pier which is also where the NI-WB Bay NERR 
weather station site is located.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of 
Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of North Inlet.  The sampling site is 
located approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of Crabhaul Creek.  The creek 
directly drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0-
32 ppt. and average tidal flux is approximately 1.4m.  The creek has an average 
depth of ~2 m MHW and average width of ~150m MHW.  The bottom mostly is 
comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus.

C) Debidue Creek (DC) - (lat 33:21:37, long 79:10:05). The Debidue Creek 
monitoring site is considered an impacted site that is located approximately 1 
km south of the Debidue Colony.  The Colony is a large development built on man-
made canals that directly drain into the northern portion of Debidue Creek.  The 
DC site is also located in an ocean-dominated Spartina marsh that was formerly 
surrounded by pine-dominated uplands.  Salinity can range from 0 to full 
strength sea water and an average tidal flux of approximately 2 meters.  The 
approximate depth and width at MHW at the site is 2.2 and 70 m respectively.  
The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and 
detritus.

D) Clambank Creek (CB) - (lat 33:20:02, long 79:11:34).  The Clambank Creek 
monitoring site is located roughly in the center of the reserve property.  This 
site is surrounded by a Spartina marsh and drains associated uplands.  Salinity 
ranged from 0.4 to full strength sea water (from August through December 2001).  
The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash and some fine sediment.  
This site is considered a pristine site and is influenced by its close proximity 
to North Inlet.  

6.  Data collection period
Thousand Acre data collection began January 1, 1995.  Debidue Creek sampling 
began March 5, 1998. Oyster Landing data collection began in 1995, however, it 
was not considered a SWMP site until 1996 when the collection site was switched 
from Caledonia to Oyster Landing. Clambank sampling began in February 1981 
through June 1995, however, it was not considered a SWMP site until sampling 
resumed in August of 2001 (08/17).  All sampling is ongoing.

7. Distribution
According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy 
for the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program, NOAA/ERD retains the right to 
analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of the NERRS System-wide Monitoring 
Program data.  The PI retains the right to be fully credited for having 
collected and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standards, the PI 
and NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and fully 
acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any part of the data are 
used.  Manuscripts resulting from the NOAA/OCRM supported research that are 
produced for publication in open literature, including refereed scientific 
journals, will acknowledge that the research was conducted under an award 
from the Estuarine Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource 
Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.  The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only 
as good as the quality assurance/quality control procedures outlined by the 
enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for 
its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons.  The Federal 
government does not assume liability to the Recipient of third persons, nor will 
the Federal government reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for its liability 
due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the general 
information link on CDMO homepage) and online at the CDMO homepage  
http://inlet.geol.sc.edu/cdmohome.html.  Data are available in text tab-
delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format.

8.  Associated researchers and projects
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core-monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  Thousand Acre is our permanent monitoring station 
for the NERR monitoring program, but Oyster Landing and Debidue Creek were also 
sampled beginning in 1998. These stations are also included in our NIW core-
monitoring program.

A long-term fish survey is also done at the Oyster Landing site bi-weekly.  
Species present, total weight, individual weights and standard lengths of fish 
that utilize the marsh at low tide are recorded.  In the spring/summer/fall 
month's fish utilizing the marsh at high tide are also sampled.

The NERR weather station is also located at the Oyster Landing site.  Air 
temperature and humidity, barometric pressure, solar radiation (total and PAR), 
wind speed and direction, and precipitation are measured.

b)	For the following dates and times DO data was deleted as membrane may have 
had a puncture (data not consistent):

10/24/01	10:00:00 thru 10/31/01	23:30:00

THOUSAND ACRES 

a)	For the following dates and times, high turbidities and low DO values were 
noted as anomalous and retained as heavy rain in Sept. and mid Oct. could have 
caused increased runoff:

10/01/01 thru 10/02/01
10/14/01 thru 10/16/01

CLAMBANK CREEK

a)	For the following dates and times turbidity data was deleted as probe was

had a puncture (data not consistent):

11/01/01 00:00:00 thru 11:30:00

c)    For the following dates and times depth data are noted as anomalous but 
left in as it was consistent with lower mean high tides for that time period:

11/21/01 12:00:00 thru 11/26/01 17:30

THOUSAND ACRES

a)   For the following period DO readings are noted as anomalous due to high DO 
peaks but were not deleted: 

11/26/2001 thru 11/27/2001

DECEMBER 2001

CLAMBANK CREEK

a)    For the following dates and times all turbidity data were retained 
although readings were zero or negative (this is probably due to a slight 
calibration error).

12/21/01  13:00:00 thru 13:30:00
12/31/01  15:30:00 thru 17:00:00
 
DEBIDUE CREEK

a)    For the following date and time turbidity data were deleted.  A turbidity 
spike occurred during the same time period that a Hydrolab was used to take 
readings adjacent to the sonde.

12/17/2001  10:00:00

OYSTER LANDING

a)    For the following dates and times all DO data was deleted as membrane may 
have had a puncture (negative DO values):

12/27/01  14:00:00 thru 12/31/01 23:30

THOUSAND ACRES

a)	For the following date and time turbidity was greater than 1000 NTU but 
not deleted.  Spike probably occurred as a result of a rain event. 

12/09/2001  23:30:00

12. Missing Data 

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.    

13. Post Deployment Information

End of Deployment Post-calibration Readings in Standard Solutions:
NA = no data available for that particular standard

14. Other Remarks:

DEBIDUE CREEK

05/22/01	PVC casing for sonde replaced (depth and DO data prior to this date 
may be affected due to heavy fouling within pipe).

07/01/01 - 07/31/01	Lots of rain in July - about 5 inches - rained on the 
following dates: 2,3,5,8,9,11,12,13,19,20,27, & 28.

07/27-07/30/01 	Data missing at DC due to vandalism at site - did not want to 
leave sonde until lock was replaced.  

08/2001 	Rain effects were evident in both SP Cond and Turb data - rain was 
documented on the 5,6,8,9,13,14,18,19,20,24,29,30, & 31 of this month (~7" 
total).

OYSTER LANDING

01/01/01	For the entire month of January the time stamp was adjusted to
