2.  Entry verification
The .dat and .csv versions of the raw data files were uploaded to a PC from 
either YSI or Hydrolab dataloggers.  Data plots were produced and examined for 
any anomalies using the CDMO graphing Macro.  Comma delimited files are opened 
in Microsoft EXCEL 5.0 and edited by removing unnecessary headers, footers and 
spaces.  Suspect data were evaluated as to being either good or bad based on 
criteria outlined in the CDMO manual ver. 3.0.  If the data were determined to 
be bad, they were deleted from the final edited .txt file and then documented in 
the metadata.  If it could not be determined whether or not suspect data were 
bad (as was often the case with turbidity) the data was left in the final edited 
.txt file and noted in the metadata as anomalous.  Missing data due to equipment 
failure or maintenance were deleted from the final edited .txt file and were 
replaced with periods (.).  Edited (.txt) and raw (.csv) files were then FTP'd 
to our Sun Sparc II server and archived.  The bi-weekly edited (.csv) files are 
merged to contain one full month of data.  All 1999 Thousand Acre, Debordieu 
Creek and Oyster Landing data were verified using the CDMO 5.0 Microsoft Excel 
outlier macro which is designed to kick out any outliers (values which fall 
outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure - see section II.8 
of this document) and other erroneous data.  Outliers were determined according 
to the instrument manufacturers' manual.  After the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros were 
run, files with suspicious data were graphed using the latest version of the 
CDMO graphing macro to determine whether there were any problems with the 
probes.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) and Turbidity (Turb) probes were the most 
problematic.  In instances where data values increased or decreased in an 
exponential fashion and or intermittently went outside the accepted range for 
that instrument and never returned to normal, the data was considered suspect, 
noted in the metadata, and removed from the final edited data file.  The 
date/hour and column reformat macros were then run on the data files before 
being saved in their final edited form (.txt).  The most current CDMO macros are 
available on the NERRS CDMO home page.  Chris Aadland edited and archived the 
1999 data for Thousand Acre, Debordieu Creek and Oyster Landing. 

3.  Research Objectives
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for North Inlet/Winyah Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality over time.  Three sites were chosen one to represent our pristine 
site and the other two to represent impacted sites.  The Oyster Landing site is 
located near the center of the Reserve and is considered pristine.  Debordieu 
Creek and Thousand Acre are both located in waterways which receive run off from 
heavily developed areas.  Measurements were taken every 30 minutes over two week 
collecting periods at the Oyster Landing, Debordieu Creek and Thousand Acre 
sites. 

4.  Research methods (YSI 6000 dataloggers)
YSI dataloggers are currently mounted in a 4" diameter PVC pipe which is 
strapped to a treated 2" X 6" board; and then attached via stainless steel bands 
to a piling at both the Thousand Acre, Debordieu Creek and Oyster Landing sites.  
The PVC pipe which houses the data loggers has two large windows cut out near 
the bottom for the probes to have direct contact with the water column.  A stop 
bolt placed through the PVC pipe below the cut out windows keeps the datalogger 
exactly one foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  Every 30 minutes measurements 
of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, water 
temperature, pH, turbidity, and water level are recorded.  The two week sampling 
interval has been selected due to biofouling of the individual probes and 
expected battery life.  At the end of each sampling interval, the dataloggers 
are brought back to the laboratory to be downloaded, cleaned and recalibrated.  
Before the instruments are cleaned and recalibrated a post calibration reading 
is taken from each instrument in fresh standard to see if any of the instruments 
exhibit drift.  The pH probe was calibrated using a two point method and either 
4,7 or 7,10 standards.  The turbidity probe calibration also used a two point 
method using 0 &100 NTU standards.  Specific Conductivity was calibrated using a 
one point method and a 10 ms/cm standard which was purchased through Fisher 
Scientific.  These procedures were carried out according to the methods 
described in the YSI Operators Manual (see sections 3 and 7).  After 
approximately 24 hours of down time for cleaning and overnight relaxing of the 
DO membrane, the YSI dataloggers were redeployed


5.  Site location and character
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in two tidal estuaries, North 
Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, 
located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type 
estuary (Pritchard, 1955)1.  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous 
winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal 
anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine 
forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The 
Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955)1, 
which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the 
largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km 
south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which 
are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain 
approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  Descriptions of the three 
sampling stations are as follows:

1) Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:18:22; long. 79:15:4) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek approximately 30 
meters northeast of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh.  The creek empties 
into the northeastern  side of the mid portion of Winyah Bay and directly drains 
pine forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 0 to 15 ppt. and tidal 
flux is approximately 1m.  The bottom is most composed of fine sediments and 
detritus.  Georgetown, 5 km upstream from the Thousand Acre site and on the 
southern side of Winyah Bay, is the home port for a number of heavy industries 
including a steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a coal fired power 
plant.  A public sewage treatment plant which discharges into the bay is also 
located in Georgetown.
2)  Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat  33:21:03; long.  79:11:24). The Oyster Landing 
monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area located at 
the end of the Oyster Landing pier which is also where the  NI/Winyah Bay NERR 
weather station site is located.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of 
Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of North Inlet.  Crabhaul Creek 
directly drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0-
32 ppt. and average tidal flux is approximately 1.4m.  The bottom mostly is 
comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus.
3)  Debordieu Creek (DC) - (lat 33:21:33, long 79:10:05). The Debordieu Creek 
monitoring site is considered an impacted site which is located approximately 1k 
south of the Debordieu Colony which is a large development built on man made 
canals which drain directly into the northern portion of Debordieu Creek.  The 
DC site is also located in an ocean-dominated Spartina marsh which was formerly 
surrounded by pine-dominated uplands.  Salinity can range from 0 to full 
strength sea water and an average tidal flux of approximately 2 meters.  The 
bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and 
detritus.


6.  Data collection period
Thousand Acre and Oyster Landing data collection both began January 1, 1995.  
Debordieu Creek sampling began March 5, 1998.  All sampling is ongoing.

7.  Associated researchers and projects
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  Thousand Acre is our permanent monitoring station 
for the NERR monitoring program, but Oyster Landing and Debordieu Creek were 
also sampled during 1998.  These stations are also included in our NIW core 
monitoring program.

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data)
Any questionable outlying data points between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 
1999, not addressed below, have been checked and correspond to probable rainfall 
or other weather related events.  Much of the Turb. data (especially in the 
Fall) which was negative or greater than 1000 was probably due to the large 
amounts of detritus in the water.
