2.  Entry Verification:
The data is directly downloaded in a spreadsheet format from the YSI 6600 
datalogger to a PC.  Edited files are created by removing the headers, footers, 
and spaces on a PC.  Missing data from YSI 6600 maintenance (downtime) is 
inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Periods were later 
removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank.  Data and graphs 
are visually inspected to find possible anomalies.  Edited and raw files are 
currently stored on 3.5-inch diskettes.  [Edited and raw data will be archived 
and stored on IBM 41T workstation].  Data files were QA/QC'd using Excel 5.0 
CDMO macros. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically 
format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow 
PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a 
two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data. Periods were later 
removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis. 
Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited 
and merged monthly files are also transferred to NERRS Centralized Data 
Management Office.  Michael Mensinger is responsible for the editing and 
archiving of these data.


3.  Research Objectives:
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for Delaware Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water 
quality over time. The four sites chosen for monitoring will assist in 
understanding the impacts of both urban and agricultural impacts on the 
respective watersheds.  Scotton Landing, Lebanon Landing, and Division Street 
are located within the St. Jones River watershed, while the Blackbird Landing 
component is located in the Blackbird Creek watershed. The St. Jones River is 
impacted by urbanization upstream and extensive agricultural activity 
throughout the basin. The Blackbird Creek is one of the least impacted riverine 
systems in Delaware, although current development pressures that exist are 
increasing. Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over two week collecting 
periods at the Scotton Landing (SL), Blackbird Landing (BL), Lebanon Landing 
(LL), and Division Street (DS) sites.


4.  Research Methods:
The YSI data sonde monitoring program was started in July 1995 at Scotton 
Landing (St. Jones River) and Blackbird Landing (Blackbird Creek).  In June 1996 
Penrose Branch (St. Jones River Basin) was added to the monitoring program. 
Penrose Branch sampling was later discontinued on December 26, 2001. In January 
2002 the Lebanon Landing and Division Street sites were added to the monitoring 
program.  Prior to deployment, a 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC pipe was mounted to 
a piling at Scotton Landing and a bridge at Blackbird Landing using stainless 
steel brackets and bolts.  These methods were also used to install a pipe to a 
piling at the Lebanon Landing dock and the pumping station bank wall at Division 
Street. Each YSI 6600 is lowered into the PVC pipe that has eight (8) two-inch 
diameter holes cut out at the bottom for the probes to have direct contact with 
the water column.  A large stainless steel bolt was placed at the bottom end of 
the PVC pipe which maintained each YSI 6600 at each site exactly one foot (30 
cm) above the river bottom.  Every half-hour over a two-week period, 
measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, temperature, pH, and water level are recorded.  Seven days after the 
deployment of each YSI 6600, the dissolved oxygen membrane is cleaned with a 
Kimwipe dipped in methanol.  Two-week sampling intervals were selected due to 
limitations created by the dissolved oxygen membrane. At the end of each two-
week period, the YSI 6600 is brought back to the office for downloading, 
cleaning, and recalibration. Calibrations performed include: dissolved oxygen, 
specific conductivity using Oakton 12,880 uS standard, turbidity using YSI 6073G 
Turbidity Standard at 100 NTU and distilled water at 0 NTU, pH using Fisher pH 
4.00, 7.00 and 10.00 buffers, and depth.  These procedures are carried out 
according to the methods as described in the YSI Model 6600 Operating and 
Service Manual.  After approximately six hours of down time for cleaning and 
recalibration, the YSI 6600's are redeployed for another two-week period. Data 
files are QA/QC'd using Excel 5.0 CDMO macros.  Edited files are merged to 
contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged monthly files are also 
transferred to NERRS Centralized Data Management Office.


5.  Site location and character:
The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component 
sites, the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are 
located along the Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located 
in central Kent County Delaware, east of the state capital city, Dover.  The 
Blackbird Creek component is located in the unincorporated area of Southern New 
Castle County.  There are four sampling sites, three located in the St. Jones 
component and one in the Blackbird Creek component.

1) Scotton Landing – is located in the Lower St. Jones River at the Scotton 
Landing Public Fishing Pier, slightly upstream of Delaware Route 113.  The river 
is 22.3 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an average depth of 4m MHW 
and the width is 50 m. At the sampling site, the depth is 3.2 m MHW and the 
width is 40 m. The sediment is clayey silt with no bottom vegetation. The 
watershed-draining site is 19778 ha. The site is influenced by freshwater runoff 
from the relatively urbanized area upstream. Pollutants in the area include 
PCB's, PAH's, and pesticides.

Salinity ranges from 1- 30 ppt.
Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) – 1.26
Neap Mean (m) – 1.13
Position:  Latitude     39 degree 05'  05.9160"  N
Longitude    75 degree 27'  38.1049"  W

2) Blackbird Landing - is located in the upper Blackbird Creek at Blackbird 
Landing Road.  The creek is 25.8 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an 
average depth of 3 m MHW, and an average width of 90 m. At the sampling site, 
the depth is 1.8 m MHW and width is 110 m. The sediment is silty clay with no 
bottom vegetation. The watershed draining site is 4694 ha. The site is 
influenced by freshwater runoff from unimpacted forested areas intermixed with 
agricultural land uses and a small amount of low-density development.  There is 
very little pollutant presence in the area.

Longitude     75 degree 29'  57.1"  W

4) Division Street- is located in the upper portion of the St. Jones River near 
the USGS station on Division Street. The site is influenced by runoff from the 
urbanized surroundings. The St. Jones River is 22.3 km long (mainstream linear 
dimension), has an average depth of 4m MHW and the width is 50 m. At the 
sampling site, the depth is 0.6m MHW and the width is 26 m. The sediment is 
clayey silt with no bottom vegetation. The site is fresh water and is influenced 
by urban freshwater runoff. The watershed draining site is 4694 ha. Pollutants 
in the area include PCB's, PAH's, and pesticides.

8.  Associated researchers and projects: 
An extensive stormwater sampling and hydrodynamic modeling project is underway 
in the upper reaches of the St. Jones River Basin.  This project includes flow 
weighted stormwater sampling to quantify pollutant loads from each of the major 
land uses found in the Basin. An additional stormwater sampling program is 
underway to analyze the impact of agricultural BMP's at sites in the Blackbird 
Creek Watershed, St. Jones River Watershed. A joint effort underway through 
NOAA's Center for Coastal Ecosystem Health and the DNERR characterization 
studies will initiate detailed monthly water quality sampling at three sites in 
each river over a two year period and will quantify the phytoplankton community 
with collections from the same sites.   This project was scheduled to be 
initiated in February 1995.(See Section I.1. for research contacts.)

Data columns are separated by tabs.  Each file contains a two line column header 
at the top of the page which identifies measurements and units for each column.

The reliability of the dissolved oxygen (DO) data after 96 hours post-deployment 
for non-EDS (Extended Deployment System) data sondes may be problematic due to 
fouling which forms on the DO probe membrane during some deployments (Wenner et 
al. 200*).  Many Reserves have upgraded to YSI 6600 EDS data sondes, which 
increase DO accuracy and longevity by reducing the environmental effects of 
fouling.  The user is therefore advised to consult the metadata and to exercise 
caution when utilizing the DO data beyond the initial 96-hour time period.  
However, this potential drift is not always problematic for some uses of the 
data, ie. periodicity analysis. It should be noted that the amount of fouling is 
site specific and that not all data are affected.  The Research Coordinator at 
the specific NERR site should be contacted concerning the reliability of the DO 
data because of the site and seasonal variation in the fouling of the DO 
sensor. All data sondes used at DNERR sites in 2003 were non-EDS models.

The NERRS System-Wide Monitoring Program utilizes YSI data sondes that can
be equipped with either depth or water level sensors.  Both sensors measure 
water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to atmospherically vented 
measurements and depth refers to non-vented measurements.  Standard calibration 
protocols for the non-vented sensor use the atmosphere pressure at the time of 
calibration.  Therefore, changes in atmospheric pressure between calibrations 
appear as changes in water depth.  The error is equal to approximately 1.03 cm 
for every 1 millibar change in atmospheric pressure.  This error is eliminated 
for level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere throughout the 
deployment time interval.  If proper atmospheric pressure data is available, 
non-vented sensor depth measurements can be corrected for deployments between 
calibrations. Readings for both vented and non-vented sensors are automatically 
compensated for water density changes due to variations in temperature and 
salinity.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be 
contacted in order to obtain information regarding atmospheric pressure 
data availability. All data sondes used at the DNERR sites in 2003 were non-
vented models.

slightly lower than previous deployment's trend. The data sonde was changed 
between these two deployments, which likely accounts for the variation in

possible obstruction, data retained.
bb) Turbidity (NTU) value on January 18, 2002 20:30:00 out of range, 1541, 
possible obstruction, data retained.

possible obstruction, data retained.
dd) Turbidity (NTU) value on January 21, 2002 11:30:00 out of range, 1368, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
ee) No data are available between January 23, 2003 12:30:00 through March 13, 
2003 13:30:00. Severe snowstorms, ice sheets, and freezing water temperatures 
made deployment impossible during this time period.

April 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003
a) Turbidity (NTU) value on May 03, 2003 17:30:00 out of range, 1126, possible 
obstruction, data retained.

July 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003
a) Turbidity (NTU) value on July 04, 2003 22:30:00 out of range, 1465, possible 
obstruction, data retained.
b) No data are available on July 24, 2003 07:30:00 since sonde was out of water 
for D.O. membrane wipe with methanol and brief sonde external cleaning.
c) Turbidity (NTU) values on September 18, 2003 from 14:30:00 through 17:00:00 
are out of range: 1067, 1249, 1240, 1169, 1004, possible obstruction, data 
retained. High values also correspond with Hurricane Isabel event.

October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003
a) Slight rise in pH range after deployment on October 02, 2003 attributed to 
usage of new pH sensor. The DNERR began testing the efficacy of the flat-probe 
pH sensor, designed for EDS sondes, on the non-EDS 6600 series units on this 
date.
b) Depth (m) values between November 13, 2002 18:30:00 through 23:00:00 and 
November 14, 2003 08:00:00 through 09:30:00 are small negative values ranging 
from 0.0 to -0.09. These negative values make up a portion of time exhibiting 
depressed water depth values. The period occurred from November 13, 2003 12:00 
through November 15, 2003 11:00:00. Consistent winds blowing from the west 
inhibited water influx from the bay. Precipitation coupled with a lack of bay 
water influx accounts for the depressed salinity readings at the time. These 
depressed salinity values do not support the sonde coming out of the water 
during this time period; all data retained.



B. Blackbird Landing

January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2003
a) No data are available between January 01, 2003 00:00:00 through March 12, 
2003 16:00:00. Severe snowstorms, ice sheets, and freezing water temperatures 
made deployment impossible during this time period.

April 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003
a) Turbidity data from April 27, 2003 00:00:00 through April 30, 2003 23:30:00 
was deleted due to unreliably high values caused by bio fouling. A sharp 
consistent rise in values commenced on the 27th and proceeded to increase, thus 
fouling was likely the cause. 
b) Turbidity data from May 01, 2003 00:00:00 through 06:00:00 was deleted due to 
unreliably high values caused by bio fouling. A sharp consistent rise in values 
commenced on April 27th and proceeded to increase, thus fouling was identified 
as the cause. 
c) A sonde change took place during the calibration and maintenance period on 
May 23, 2003 due to eyelet breakage for the primary upper sonde hanging bracket. 
As a result of the sonde change, small differences in parameters exist before 
and after the deployment. This specifically explains a slight drop in turbidity 
value range between the readings pre- and post- maintenance/calibration.
d) Turbidity (NTU) value on June 13, 2003 13:00:00 out of range, 1346, possible 
obstruction, data retained.
e) Turbidity (NTU) values on June 27, 2003 15:00:00 through 16:30:00 are out of 
range: 2189, 2187, and 2187. Evidence of possible obstruction, data retained.


July 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003
a) Slightly higher pH data set values follow the deployment on July 02, 2003 
compared to pre-retrieval data set values on the same day. This small difference 
is attributed to the change of pH probes during maintenance/calibration on that 
day.
b) Turbidity (NTU) value on July 05, 2003 12:00:00 out of range, 2001, possible 
obstruction, data retained.

water for D.O. membrane wipe with methanol and general sonde cleaning.
d) No data are available from July 18, 2003 15:00:00 through August 05, 2003 
06:00:00 due to equipment failure.
e) Turbidity (NTU) value on August 12, 2003 07:00:00 out of range, 1978, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
f) Turbidity (NTU) value on August 13, 2003 06:30:00 out of range, 1989, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
g) Turbidity (NTU) value on August 13, 2003 19:30:00 out of range, 1749, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
h) Turbidity (NTU) value on August 14, 2003 21:30:00 out of range, 2024, 
possible obstruction, data retained.

possible obstruction, data retained.
k) Turbidity (NTU) value on September 02, 2003 11:00:00 out of range, 1195, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
l) Depth and salinity values from September 18, 2003 through September 19, 2003 
are higher than the average trend due to activity from Hurrican Isabel.


October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003
a) Turbidity (NTU) value on October 01, 2003 12:00:00 out of range, 1743, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
b) Turbidity (NTU) value on October 01, 2003 21:00:00 out of range, 1874, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
c) Turbidity (NTU) value on November 11, 2003 23:30:00 out of range, 1693, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
d) Turbidity (NTU) value on November 12, 2003 03:00:00 out of range, 1704, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
e) Turbidity (NTU) value on November 12, 2003 04:00:00 out of range, 1699, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
f) Turbidity (NTU) value on November 13, 2003 02:00:00 out of range, 1717, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
g) Turbidity (NTU) value on November 13, 2003 23:00:00 out of range, 1358, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
h) Depth trend is abnormally low during the period from November 13, 2003 
03:00:00 through November 15, 2003 16:30:00. Depth readings were likely affected 
by barometric pressure changes and westerly wind influence at the time from a 
front moving through the area as evidenced by DNERR meteorological data; data 
retained.



C. Lebanon Landing

January 1, 2003 through March 31, 2003
a) No data are available between January 23, 2003 12:30:00 through March 13, 
2003 14:00:00. Severe snowstorms, ice sheets, and freezing water temperatures 
made deployment impossible during this time period.

April 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003
a) Depression of maximum salinity values during high tides from April 10, 2003 
to April 17, 2003 likely due to runoff influence from storms.
b) All data from May 18, 2003 13:00:00 through May 21, 2003 07:30:00 was 
removed. Distinct depth shift indicated sonde was disturbed (pulled up) and not 
allowed to settle to the bottom after disturbance.

July 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003
a) Slightly higher pH values follow the deployment on September 03, 2003 
compared to pre-retrieval values on the same day. This small difference is 
likely attributed to the change of pH probes during maintenance/calibration on 
that day.
b) Elevated depth readings from September 18, 2003 11:00:00 through September 
19, 2003 19:00:00 correspond to precipitation event associated w/ hurricane 
Isabel.
c) Elevated salinity readings from September 18, 2003 16:00:00 through September 
19, 2003 12:30:00 correspond to event associated w/ hurricane Isabel.
d) Elevated turbidity readings from September 18, 2003 17:00:00 through 23:00:00 
correspond to event associated w/ hurricane Isabel.

October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003
a) Depth (m) values between November 13, 2003 12:30:00 through November 15th, 
2003 13:00:00 exhibit depressed water depth values. Consistent winds blowing 
from the west inhibited water influx from the bay. Precipitation coupled with a 
lack of bay water influx accounts for the depressed salinity readings at the 
time. These depressed salinity values do not support the sonde coming out of the 
water during this time period; all data retained.
b) Slightly lower pH values follow the deployment on December 15, 2003 compared 
to pre-retrieval values during the same day. This small difference is likely 
attributed to the change of sondes between retrieval and deployment.

obstruction, data retained.
b) Turbidity (NTU) value on April 16, 2003 22:30:00 out of range, 1187, possible 
obstruction, data retained.
c) Turbidity (NTU) value on May 01, 2003 13:00:00 is a negative value, -0005. 
Data point should be read as zero and attributed to calibration error.
d) Turbidity (NTU) value on May 04, 2003 01:00:00 out of range, 1631, possible 
obstruction, data retained.
e) Turbidity (NTU) value on May 04, 2003 02:30:00 out of range, 1140, possible 
obstruction, data retained.
f) Turbidity (NTU) value on May 05, 2003 13:00:00 out of range, 1180, possible 
obstruction, data retained.
g) Elevated depth (m) readings from June 22, 2003 00:00:00 through June 23, 2003 
00:00:00 due to heavy rain events and storm runoff.


July 1, 2003 through September 30, 2003
a) No data are available on July 08, 2003 13:00:00 since sonde was out of water 
for D.O. membrane wipe with methanol and brief external sonde cleaning.
b) Drop in DO should be considered suspect on July 26, 2003 at 02:00:00 for no 
known reason, possibly due to fish in vicinity of probe. 
c) Turbidity (NTU) value on August 17, 2003 20:00:00 out of range, 2892, 
possible obstruction, data retained.
d) Turbidity (NTU) value on September 03, 2003 02:00:00 out of range, 1931,

possible obstruction, data retained.
j) Elevated depth readings from September 18, 2003 12:00:00 through September 
19, 2003 13:00:00 correspond to precipitation event associated w/ hurricane 
Isabel.


October 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003
a) The depth (m) value on October 14, 2003 21:00:00 is zero. Based on other 
parameters it cannot be concluded that the sonde was out of water. The sonde may 
have been affected by changes in barometric pressure; all data retained.
b) Depth (m) values between October 21, 2003 13:00:00 through 20:30:00 are zero 
or small negative values ranging from 0 to -0.1. Based on other parameters it 
cannot be concluded that the sonde was out of water. The sonde may have been 
affected by changes in barometric pressure; all data retained.
c) The depth (m) value on October 22, 2003 03:30:00 is zero. Based on other 
parameters it cannot be concluded that the sonde was out of water. The sonde may 
have been affected by changes in barometric pressure; all data retained.
d) Depth (m) values between October 22, 2003 12:30:00 through 14:30:00 are zero 
or small negative values ranging from 0 to -0.1. Based on other parameter values 
it cannot be concluded that the sonde was out of water. The sonde may have 
been affected by changes in barometric pressure; all data retained.
e)DO percent saturation and concentration values (133.5% & 14.6 mg/l) on 
November 13, 2003 at 07:30:00 are higher than the trend for this time period and 
represent single spikes in among a uniform value range. Data considered suspect, 
but retained in the data set.
f) Slightly higher pH values ranges follow the deployment on December 15, 2003 
compared to pre-retrieval values during the same day. This small difference is 
likely attributed to the change of sondes between retrieval and deployment.

14. Other Remarks/Notes

a) D.O probe warm up times were discussed at the 2002 NERR Technician Training 
Session. It was agreed that the entire system would employ a 60 second warm up 
time for the DO sensor. Sonde start times are set 1 minute prior to the desired 
reading time to compensate for the 60 second warm up period. Warm up times were 
changed as follows: Scotton Landing (deployment on February 21, 2002), Lebanon 
Landing (deployment on February 01, 2002), Division Street (deployment on 
January 31, 2002), Blackbird Landing (deployment on February 06, 2002). 
Autosleep functions were also checked on these dates and turned on wherever 
necessary.

b) A new model 6136 turbidity probe was introduced in 2002 by YSI. This new 
probe replaced the old 6026 model. The dates of change for each site were as 
follows: Scotton Landing (deployment on March 12, 2002), Lebanon Landing 
(deployment on March 12, 2002), Division Street (deployment on April 03, 2002), 
Blackbird Landing (deployment on March 06, 2002). Model 6026 probes acted as 
stand ins due to 6136 calibration difficulties/probe failure at the following 
sites at these date time ranges:

c) Calibration procedures changed with the introduction of the new turbidity 
probe model. The turbidity probe are now 3 inches from calibration fluid cup 
bottom. The calibration fluid cup always sits directly on a black surface (prior 
procedure used cup suspended over black surface). 

d) YSI introduced a new sonde guard with the new turbidity probes. The new guard 
measures 8 ½" and replaced the old 6 ½" guard. Please note the 2" difference 
between the new and old guards in regards to depth data when comparing current 
data with data prior to dates in Section 14, part b). Guard change dates are 
synonymous with turbidity probe model change dates listed in section 14, part b) 
of this document.

e) Hurricane Isabel hit Delaware during the period of September 18-19, 2003. 

f) The DNERR commenced testing of the flat sensor pH probe at the Scotton 
Landing site on October 2, 2003. The purpose of this probe alteration is to test 
the effectiveness of the flat sensor probe when used in conjunction with a 
series 6600 non-EDS data sonde.

g) On November 25, 2003 the DNERR began using YSI 6073G brand turbidity standard 
for turbidity probe calibration and abandoned the previously used APS Analytical 
Standards brand.
