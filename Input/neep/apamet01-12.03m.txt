2) Entry verification:

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each instrument on the weather 
station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger. The CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr_301.csi) was 
loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software 
supplied by Campbell Scientific.  

Once an entire month of data were available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) was 
used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic to interface 
with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection 
schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into an Access 
Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly 
raw data file into an Access Database.  Second, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error 
criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and summary reports. Any anomalous data 
were investigated and are noted below in the Anomalous Data section. Any data corrections that were 
performed are noted in the Data Correction section below. The most common error reported was the 
"technician changed array data...".  These data changes were primarily due to sensor malfunction and wiring 
problems.  In these instances the erroneous data were deleted by the technician and replaced with the code 
"55555".  Other common errors were temperature changes greater than 3 ºC and precipitation differences 
greater than 5 mm.

As of November 3rd, 2003, the new CDMO Data Logger program (NERR_4.csi) was loaded on the 
CR10X. The Data Logger program controls the sampling of the sensors. Meteorological conditions are 
measured every 5 seconds from each sensor and stored on the CR10X. Data are output to a file in three 
arrays: array 15 stores 15 minute averages, max and min data; array 60 stores hourly data; max and min 
data; and array 144 stores daily average, max and min data. Storage modules are used to interface between 
the CR10X and the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific. New 4M storage modules were used 
to store the larger output needed for the new program.  EQwin now replaces the WDMP as the NERR MET primary 
QA/QC program. 

Files are exported from PC208W in a comma-delimited format (.DAT file) and opened in Microsoft Excel for 
pre-processing with the EQWin format macro that was developed by the CDMO to reformat the header 
columns, insert station codes, insert a date column (mm/dd/yyyy), correct the time column format and 
reformat the data to the appropriate number of decimal places. The pre-processed file is then ready to be 
copied into the EQWin weather.eqi file where the data are QA/QC'd and archived in the database. EQWin 
queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data set outliers (values that fall outside the range that 
the instrument is designed to measure) and large changes in the data. EQWin is also used to generate 
statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and reports of the data, cross-query the water, weather 
and nutrient data and finally export the data to the CDMO. Any anomalous data are investigated and noted 
below in the Anomalous/ Suspect Data Section. Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the 
Deleted Data Section below. 

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule:

i) data are collected in the following formats:

	1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation data 
	that are totalized from 5-second samples sorted by date and time. (Arrays 150 and

3) Research objectives:

Data collected from the East Bay weather station complements those data taken from the East Bay water 
quality station. Positioning the weather station in East Bay allows the Reserve to monitor changes in 
rainfall, photosynthetically active radiation, temperature, and other weather parameters influencing the 
water quality of East Bay.  East Bay drains the Tate's Hell Swamp area, which was altered in the late 
1960's and early 1970's by timber companies. An EPA grant allowed the Northwest Florida Water Management 
District to begin restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.

4) Research methods:

There were no other analyses, data collection intervals, or QA/QC procedures for the WDMP in Apalachicola 
other than those expressed in Version 4.0 of the CDMO manual.

5) Site location and character:

The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the northwestern part of Florida, 
generally called the panhandle.  It is located adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of 
the Apalachicola Bay system, including 52 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both natural and 
manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.  The sampling site is located in the 
upper reaches of East Bay.   East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a causeway 
and is located to the north of Apalachicola Bay proper.  The bay is 8.2 km long, has an average depth of 
approximately 1.0 m MHW, and an average width of 1.8 km. The tides in East Bay are mixed and range 
from 0.3 m to 1.0 m (average 0.5 m). The weather station is located at latitude 29 47.454' N and longitude 
84 53.004' W.  This site is less than 0.5 nautical miles west of the Apalachicola water quality station.  
The site is located near the tip of a peninsula, which separates Blount's Bay from West Bayou.  The 
peninsula is dominated by marsh vegetation (mainly Juncus roemerianus).  There is a cabbage palm hammock 
along the southern shoreline of the peninsula.  The dominant upland habitat is primarily pineland forest 
to the northwest, which includes slash pine, saw palmetto, and sand pine. The weather station sensors are 
mounted at the top of a 3-meter tower.  The tower is mounted on a 6' platform.  The tipping bucket rain 
gauge is mounted on a 4' platform approximately 15 feet from the weather station platform.  There is nothing 
nearby to shade the tower and the nearest wind block is the edge of the pine forest about one-half to three-
quarters of a mile north to northwest of the station.

6) Data collection period: January-December, 2003

The Apalachicola weather monitoring station was erected on August 27, 1999 and began monitoring on 
September 3, 1999.  The data submitted with this report encompasses data collected from 0015 hours 
January 1, 2003 through 0000 hrs December 31, 2003.  Actual module deployment during this time period 
began on 12/3/2002 at 1330 hrs and ended 2/2/2004 at 1400.

14) Other Remarks/notes

A new temperature/RH sensor was installed on July 25, 2002 at 0745. All temperature/RH data collected 
from the installation date through March 10, 2003 at 0830 were incorrect due to a faulty sensor. After 
discussions with Bob Scarborough and Campbell Scientific, as well as rewiring the sensor, it was finally 
decided that the new sensor was faulty. The temperature/RH sensor was repaired in February of 2003, 
installed on March 10, 2003 at 0845 and is now functioning correctly.

Tropical Storm Bill passed over the Apalachicola Bay area on June 30, 2003

The wires to two of the sensors had been chewed when the Weather Station was serviced on November 3rd. 
The actual wiring appeared to have not been damaged, so the places that had been stripped were repaired 
with electrical tape. The data file appears to have not been corrupted by this event. 

When the new CR10X program was loaded on the CR10X, it was discovered that the time stamp was a year 
behind. The year was adjusted on November 17th, 2003. Two raw files have incorrect year values: 
data069.dat and data070.dat. The year was corrected after the file was run through the Eqwinformat.xls 
macro and before entry into EQWin.

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points. 


Rain Events: All measurements in mm.
