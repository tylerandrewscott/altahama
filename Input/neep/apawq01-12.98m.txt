2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6000 into the PC6000 software, 
plotted, and initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing data.  Hydrolab 
data are downloaded from the Hydrolab Datasonde 3 to PCPLUS software.  Both YSI 
and Hydrolab raw data files are then downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) 
and imported into Microsoft Excel as a comma-space delimited file (.csv).  These 
raw data files are then organized into standardized monthly data sets using the 
import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, 
import the raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters 
for depth readings if necessary, and save the monthly files as either a .csv or 
.xls file.  Once in monthly format, these files are then run through the 
cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which identify outliers, insure correct number of data 
points for each Date/Hour count, and format the columns in the correct order and 
size.  The monthly files are then carefully edited by staff for data anomalies 
which are identified in Section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this document.  Any data 
that are deleted by staff are replaced with periods and identified in Section 12 
(Missing Data) of this document.   Monthly edited files are then FTP'd to CDMO 
in text format, along with an updated metadata form.  

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the 
Tates Hell Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage 
period and allowed increased runoff with a concommittant increase in pH which 
had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  Because of this 
some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was done.  
A large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant allowed them to begin 
restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning 
the dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay will allow the Reserve to 
monitor changes in water quality during this restoration effort. 


4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the 
NERRS national monitoring effort.  Prior to this, ANERR has been and continues 
to monitor three stations in the Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, 
using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's.  East Bay (bottom) is one of these stations and 
will be used in this monitoring program in addition to the YSI datalogger placed 
near the surface at this site. Since a Hydrolab datalogger was initially 
installed at the bottom at the East Bay station, we continued to use the 
Hydrolab brand in order to keep the data consistent with the previous two years 
of data.  

Prior to deployment, both the YSI 6000 and the Datasonde 3 are calibrated for 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, and pH following the procedures outlined 
in the YSI Operating and Service Manual (with addendum 7/94) and the Hydrolab 
Operating Manual, respectively.  Lab grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) 
are initially used to calibrate the YSI's, which are 
then used to check working standards made up and used for ongoing salinity 
calibration.  Lab grade standards are also used periodically to check the 
accuracy of the working salinity standards.  The only variation from the manual 
is the use of only one pH standard for one-point calibration of pH rather than 
three-point calibration.  The membranes for the dissolved oxygen probe are 
installed at least 12 hours prior to calibration.  Depth is set to 0.0 meters in 
the lab.  A turbidity probe was added to the YSI 6000 in December 1996 and is 
calibrated using a lab grade (Fisher Brand) 40 NTU standard and deionized water 
(0 NTU).

Both YSI and Hydrolab dataloggers are deployed on the same piling within a five 
inch diameter stainless-steel tube with a locking cap.  In order to maintain 
constant depth, the dataloggers are clamped to a pvc pipe and lowered into the 
tube, relinquishing the need for diving.  Large holes were cut in the tube where 
the probes are located to insure adequate circulation.  Every two weeks the 
dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected.  Freshly 
calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data 
gaps in the 30 minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the 
northwestern part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located 
adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola 
Bay system, including 52 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both 
natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a 
causeway and is located to the north of the bay proper.  The sampling site is 
located in the upper reaches of East Bay and is influenced by local runoff from 
Tates Hell, the East Bay marshes, and distributary flow, some of which comes 
from the Apalachicola River via the East River.  The piling location is latitude 
29?47.15' N and longitude 84?52.52' W.  Normal tidal range is approximately 0.5 
meters.  Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt but is generally in the low range due 
to the freshwater input from the Tate's Hell drainage.  The freshwater input is 
very tanic and usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are not 
quantified due to the diverse sources of the runoff.  Depth at mean high water 
is 2.2 meters.  The bottom type is soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with 
no vegetation present.

6. Data collection period:
East Bay surface sampling with the YSI began on April 17, 1995.  East Bay bottom 
sampling began on May 1, 1995. Both continue through December 31 of this year.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's to monitor water quality at three 
stations in Apalachicola Bay since May of 1992.  One of these stations was moved 
from the mid-bay area near the Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site 
in January of 1993.  The other two are located on two of the largest 
commercially important oyster bars in the bay.  These stations, like East Bay, 
are intended to be long-term.  Other associated researchers and projects which 
have utilized this water quality data are as follows:

12. Notes/Other remarks

Hurricane Earl passed over this area on 9/3/98. 
Hurricane Georges passed south of us on 9/26/98.   

Both storms had significant affects on non-vented depth as the low pressure storms passed over
resulting in increased depth levels at the East Bay Surface sampling site.
