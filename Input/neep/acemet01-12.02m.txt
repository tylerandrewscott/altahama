2.	Entry Verification
a)	Data Input Procedures
The 15-minute, 1-hour average and 24-hour meteorological data recorded by each sensor 
are stored in a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program 
(nerr30.csi) that is loaded into the datalogger controls the sensors and data collections 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  
The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.
	
The PC208W software is installed on a laptop computer.  This computer is used to 
download the weather data from the datalogger via a SC32A interface.  This data are saved 
in a text file (*.DAT). 

Once an entire month of data is collected, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) is used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERR Meteorological Data Collection 
Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  
The WDMP inputs and converts the monthly raw data file into the database, as described 
below.

First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access database.  
Next, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Appendix G 
for the CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data Criteria).  Finally, it 
produces error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data are investigated and noted in the 
Anomalous Data/Data Corrections Section.  Any data corrections that are performed are 
noted in the Anomalous Data/Data Correction Section below. 
	
Common error noted in the monthly error reports was missing data, which was caused 
by a faulty solar panel regulator and lead acid battery. 
Saundra Upchurch and Amy Whitaker Dukes are responsible for these tasks.

Gemteck's EQwin version 5 and the CDMO developed Microsoft Excel EQWinFormat.xls macro now replaces 
the WDMP as the NERR MET database management program and primary QA/QC program.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time.

3.	Research objectives
The principal objective of the Weather Monitoring Program is to record long-term 
meteorological data for the ACE Basin in order to observe any environmental changes or 
trends over time.  

4.	Research Methods
The Campbell Scientific weather station measures the parameters every 5 seconds to 
produce both hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, and wind speed and wind direction.  An 
instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150. A 
laptop computer is used to download the data from the datalogger via the SC32A interface.  
On -site weather conditions are measured to verify the accuracy of the readings by the 
sensors.  After downloading data, sensors on the weather station are inspected for damage 
or debris.  If any problems are found, it is repaired and/or cleaned. Tree limbs and 
other shrubs are cut back to prevent obstruction of the sensors.  Sensors will be removed 
and sent back to ampbell Scientific for calibration at a minimum of every two years. 

5.	Site Location and Character
The ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States, including portions of Charleston, 
Colleton and Beaufort Counties in South Carolina.  The study area encompasses the 
Ashepoo, Combahee, and South Edisto River basins, which empty into St. Helena Sound.  
Diverse estuarine wetlands provide extensive and complex habitat types for fish and 
wildlife.  The NERR consist of approximately 92,000 acres of tidal marshes.  Of this, 
65,600 acres are salt marshes, 13,600 acres are brackish marshes and 12,100 acres are 
freshwater marshes.  

Interspersed within these three tidal marsh zones are approximately 26,000 acres of 
managed wetlands, marsh impoundments.  St. Helena Sound comprises approximately 
23,870 acres of open coastal marine and estuarine waters.  

The weather station is located at the Bennett's Point field station (32° 33.5623'N,
80° 27.2715'W) on Mosquito Creek, a navigable tributary off of the Ashepoo River.  
The station is approximately 90 m from the creek (800 m from the Ashepoo River) in a 
grassy field, 80 m to the southwest of the field station.  The closest wind obstructions
are oak trees, 25 m to the south and southwest of the weather station and 70 m from a 
public paved road. 

The CR10X datalogger and the barometric sensor are enclosed in a 1.8 m elevated 
aluminum box.  Two long poles are attached to the aluminum box, which elevate sensors 
above potential barriers and enhance the performance of each sensor. The Wind Sentry 
sensor and Temperature/Relative Humidity sensor are attached to a cross bar mounted on 
top of a 3 m pole.  The Solar Panel is attached to 2.5 m long pole, and is oriented to 
the east at approximately a 47-degree angle.  The LiCor sensor is attached to the outside 
top of the box.  The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge (1.3 m height) is located 2.5 m to the 
southeast of the box on a concrete level platform.  The sensors are wired to the CR10X 
following protocol in the CDMO Manual, with minor changes due to upgraded sensors.

8.	Associated Researchers and Projects
The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project is a study, which records long-term water 
quality data for the ACE Basin in order to observe any physical changes or tends in water 
quality over time. The two sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South Edisto 
River. One site represents an urban or "treatment" site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big 
Bay Creek (approximately 14 kilometers from the weather station, GPS coordinates: 
32'29"38.72125N and 80'19"21.69864W). It is surrounded by residential and commercial 
development and subject to nonpoint source pollution. The other site is our pristine site 
and is located in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (approximately 9 kilometers from the 
weather station, GPS coordinates: 32'31"40.59518N and 80'21"41.25481W).  The tidal creek 
and St. Pierre Creek are surrounded by a wide expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh.  
Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs fringe the banks. Development in the immediate area 
is sparse, and this creek is subject to relatively light boat traffic.  Measurements for 
both sites are taken every thirty minutes over roughly a two-week collection period.
	
In July 1997, the Reserve staff initiated nutrient monitoring study.  The objective 
of the study is to ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient levels near 
our two data logger sites.  Nutrient levels are measured during a complete tidal cycle 
each month, and the samples are analyzed for ammonia, nitrite-nitrate, ortho-phosphate, 
and chlorophyll a concentrations.  In January of 2002, the nutrient monitoring protocol 
was added to the NERR System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP). 
	
In the spring of 2000, SCDNR Geologists completed the construction of 
sediment/erosion tables (SET) in the ACE Basin NERR, including our water quality 
stations, to determine the effects hydrologic changes on the marsh elevation.  The 
geologists monitor the SET stations monthly.
Dr. Charles Wenner of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute received funding 
through the National Marine Fisheries Service in January of 2001 to continue an ongoing 
survey of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in the South Edisto and Combahee River basins, 
by electro-fishing in tidal freshwater and low salinity brackish water.  Although red 
drum are the target species, all catches are separated, measured and weighted to provide 
a distribution and population size for each species.    
The ACE Basin NERR received initial funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to establish a National Atmospheric Deposition Program site in the Reserve. 
Sampling efforts began on January 1, 2002 and will continue for five years. Weekly 
precipitation samples are collected and analyzed for atmospheric pollutants.  The 
precipitation collector is located on Bear Island, a Wildlife Management Area inside the 
NERR.
		
The ACE Basin participated in the NOAA funded, NERR Invasive Decapod 
Pilot project. Sampling efforts began in August of 2002, and will continue through 
June of 2003.  Utilizing the established NERR systems, four northwestern NERR sites and 
five southeastern NERR sites were selected to participate in the pilot project.  The 
project was designed to understand which crabs have invaded which sites.  Identical crab 
collectors are deployed at the participating Reserves, and all crabs found in collectors 
are identified, measured, and counted.  The sex and general condition of crabs 
(reproductive status, molt stage, obvious parasites, etc.) are noted as well.  
	
Dr. Clark Alexander of Skidaway Institute and ACE Basin Reserve staff 
conducted a spatial distribution of salinity, at high slack water, in each of the rivers 
of the ACE Basin in September of 2002.  This study was initiated after severe drought 
conditions impacted the NERR during the summer of 2002.  A second sample will be 
conducted in April of 2003.  
		
The results of addition studies conducted in the ACE Basin can be 
obtained by contacting the Reserve.

From January 17 at 18:00 to January 18 at 08:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From January 21 at 19:00 to January 22 at 07:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From January 28 at 19:00 to January 29 at 09:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From January 29 at 19:00 to January 30 at 13:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From January 30 at 19:00 to January 31 at 12:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.

b)	The wind sentry sensor used to measure wind direction has a written disclaimer 
stating that wind directions near or at due north (360 degrees) may read slightly skewed.  
Slightly negative numbers sometimes occur when no wind is blowing. The value was changed to 0.
At 10:00 on January 12, wind direction was greater than 360 or less than 0 degrees,(-0.09484).

c)	The following data appear to be correct.  The increase in temperature is caused by 
a hange in wind direction.  The wind direction shifted from an offshore to an onshore 
wind.  
From 03:45 to 04:00 on January 23, air temp difference is greater than 3.0 degrees C, 
(11.422 to 15.161).

d)	On January 29, the Weather Station was powered down from approximately 10:50 am to 
11:10 am.  A connection problem was discovered while the technician attempted to 
download the data from the Campbell Scientific data logger to a laptop computer.   
Powering down the station allowed the system to reset itself and the problem was 
corrected.  The hourly averages (array 101 and 102) were deleted for the 10:00 and 
11:00 AM hours.  The daily averages, maximums, and minimums (array 241, 242, 243, and
244) were deleted at the 24:00 hour.  
  

February 2002

From February 22 at 15:00 to February 23 at 05:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From February 24 at 19:00 to February 25 at 07:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.

c)	The following data are suspect.  The reason for the sudden increase in relative 
humidity 
is not known at this time. 
From 15:15 to 15:30 on February 14, relative humidity difference is greater than 25%, 
(32.238 to 58.935).   


March 2002
a)	The following data appear to be correct.
From March 5 at 19:00 to March 6 at 08:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From March 13 at 20:00 to March 14 at 08:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From March 14 at 20:00 to March 15 at 09:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.
From March 16 at 19:00 to March 17 at 08:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.

From March 25 at 20:00 to March 26 at 08:00, wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s.

b)	The following data appear to be correct.  The rise in temperature is caused by a 
decrease in relative humidity and a shift in wind direction. 
From 00:15 to 00:30 on March 11, air temp difference is greater than 3.0 degrees C, 
(7.0087 to 10.02).

c)	The following data appear to be correct.  The drop in temperature is caused by an 
increase in relative humidity and a rainfall event.
