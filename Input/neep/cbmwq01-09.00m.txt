2. Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a PC from the YSI 6000UPG data logger and graphs are 
produced and quickly examined using the PC6000 software.  Data files are then 
exported from the PC6000 format into Excel (for Windows NT 3.1) files where the 
headers, footers, and inappropriate spaces are removed.  Plots of the data are 
made and suspect data (outliers) are dealt with accordingly.  Removed data 
points and missing data are replaced with a periods (.).  Edited files 
are merged to contain one full month for each data logger.  Data is then QA/QC'd 
using the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros and Appendix B., YSI 6000 Data Review and 
Editing Protocol.  

3. Research Objectives
The purpose of the monitoring program at CBM NERR is to conform to the NERR SWMP 
monitoring program looking at trends in water quality over both temporal and 
spatial scales.  A difference in how marshes can change water quality is being 
studied by comparing a marsh creek site to a river channel site.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes over a 5-14 day period at both the Patuxent River 
Park (PR) and Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) sites.  

4. Research methods (YSI data loggers)
Each YSI data logger is laid down on a 4" diameter PVC pipe that has been cut in 
half.  The PVC is nailed to a 4"x4" block of wood which is secured is to a crab 
pot.  The crab pot with the data logger in it sits on the bottom at both sites.  
At each site, the crab pot is locked to a pier.  The YSI probes sit 
approximately 6-10 centimeters above the sediment.  Every 30 minutes up to a 
two-week period, measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity and water level are 
recorded.  Within 14 days of deployment, the data is downloaded and either new 
calibrated probes are installed or a new YSI unit with calibrated probes are 
placed at each site.  At times, however, probes and/or units could not be 
replaced resulting in prolong periods of missing data.  Calibration procedures 
are carried out according to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.

5. Site location and character
The Chesapeake Bay Maryland NERR has three components in Maryland's portion of 
Chesapeake Bay.  Monie Bay is a mesohaline region on the lower Eastern Shore; 
Otter Point Creek is a tidal freshwater river and marsh system; and Jug Bay is 
part of the freshwater portion of the Patuxent River.  Both data loggers are 
within the Jug Bay component.

1) Patuxent River Park (PR) - (38 deg 46' 00" N, 76 deg 42' 30" W) is on the 
Prince Georges County side of the River.  The data logger is on the flank of the 
River channel off of Jackson Landing.   The Patuxent is approximately 50 meters 
wide at Jackson Landing.  High sedimentation rates have led to a very soft 
bottom at this point in the Patuxent River.  Salinity rarely reaches above 1 
ppt.
2) Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) - (38 deg 46' 00" N, 76 deg 42' 30" W) is on 
the Anne Arundel County side of the River directly across from PR.  The data 
logger is in a shallow tidal marsh creek that is approximately 5 meters wide.  
Wide temperature fluctuations are normal at this site.  Salinity rarely 
reaches above 1 ppt. 

6. Data collection period
Data loggers initiated collection in January 2000 and continued through the 
middle of September of 2000, at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) only.  Data 
loggers initiated collection in March 2000 and continued until the beginning of 
September of 2000, at Patuxent River Park (PR).

location as the data logger at JB.

11. Data anomalies (suspect data)
Suspect and outlier data from any measurement collected was replaced with a 
period (.).  This is in accordance with the QA/QC procedure.  Outliers were 
removed throughout the 2000 time period and are believed to be the result of 
internal datasonde error.
