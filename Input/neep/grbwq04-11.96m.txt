2.  Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a Zenith computer from the YSI 6000 data sonde in a comma 
delimited format. Files are then transferred to a Macintosh computer and opened in Excel 5.0 
software and edited. Missing data from YSI maintenance and other reasons are inserted into 
the spreadsheet and denoted by periods (.). Edited files are merged to contain one full month 
of data.  Data is graphed in Excel 5.0 and visually inspected for anomalies.  Files are verified 
by means of CDMO Excel 5.0 macros.  The data is archived on two computer hard drives as 
well as 3.5" disks.  Files are send to the CDMO server by means of a file transfer program 
(Fetch for the Macintosh).  These tasks are performed by Jaimie Wolf

3.  Experimental design
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over two-week periods at the Great Bay site.  This 
monitoring program began in July, 1995.  The goal of the study is to establish baseline 
conditions for the Great Bay Estuary at a non-impacted site. 

4.  Research methods (YSI data loggers)
In 1996 one data logger is deployed at the GRB NERR site.
In Great Bay the data logger is anchored to the bottom at a distance of one meter from the 
bottom.  Every half hour over a two-week period, measurements of specific conductivity, 
salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature and water level are recorded.  
At the end of the two-week period, the YSI data logger is brought back to the Jackson Lab for 
downloading, cleaning and recalibrating. Conductivity and pH standards purchased from VWR 
Scientific are used for calibration.  Calibration is performed as outlined in the YSI users' 
manual. The data logger is then redeployed for another two-week period.

5.  Site location and character
The Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the northeastern coast of 
the United States at the tidal estuary, Great Bay in the southeastern part of New Hampshire.  
This year (1996) there is one sampling site.  The original reason for the Exeter River 
deployment site was to monitor water quality conditions before and after implementation of 
stormwater BMP's in urban Exeter.  Since BMP's were not implemented as scheduled, Coastal 
Program staff determined that redeployment at that location would not address the intended 
objective. 
Great Bay  (GB)
Central area of Great Bay proper.  
The coordinates of the deployment are 43¯04'20" latitude and 70¯52'10" longitude.
Salinity range: 5-32 ppt (seasonally); 0-5ppt from high to low tide.
Temperature range: -1¯C to 27¯C (seasonally); 0-3¯ from high to low tide
Depth: 5.5 meters at MLW
Tidal height of 2.7 meters
Bottom type: Mud and rock channel bottom
Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Squamscott, Lamprey and Winnicut Rivers plus smaller streams. High
tide influence from Little Bay and associated rivers
Pollutant influence: clean reference site

6.  Data collection period
Great Bay data collection began April 15, 1996. The data logger had been removed from the 
water during the winter months due to icing. (1/1/96-4/14/96 and 12/1/96-12/31/96)

10. Data anomalies (suspect data)
August 1996	GB: Depth data was removed 8/11/96 11:00:00 to 8/16/96 10:30:00 Data 
logger had lost one of 	its weights and risen to the surface where it became tangled in eelgrass.
	pH data was removed 8/16/96 11:00:00 to 8/30/96 14:30:00 because the pH probe 
	broke  	during time of deployment
	DO data was removed 8/30/96 15:00:00 to 8/31/96 23:30:00 The data logger 
recorded DO 
	in negative numbers for a period of time
	
September 1996	GB: DO data was removed 9/1/96 00:00:00 to 9/19/96 13:30:00 DO 
probe malfunctioning, 	recording negative values

July 1996
	GB: No data 7/29/96 13:30:00 In July it was decided to use both data loggers at 
	the GB site. One was retrieved and the other set out the same day to 	minimize 
	missing data due to downloading and servicing in the lab. On this day there was 
	one sampling time missed because the times of retrieval and 	deployment did not 
	overlap
