2.  Entry Verification

The data are uploaded directly from the YSI model 6000 or 6600 data loggers to 
the YSI Ecowatch for windows software into a file appended with the suffix 
".dat". The data are also downloaded directly from the datalogger into a 
spreadsheet importable file appended with the suffix ".csv". The data are then 
reviewed for major problems (i.e. logger out of water, probe malfunction, 
battery failure, etc.) using the YSI Ecowatch for windows plotting software.  
The resulting plot is printed out and saved in a folder named "datalogger 
deployment log".  The .csv file is imported into Excel 2000 for Windows, where 
it is edited and formatted.

The tails of each sampling period are deleted and any suspect data are 
identified with the aid of CDMO Excel macros.  Suspect data are evaluated and 
dealt with according to CDMO Operations Manual (ver.4.0) guidelines.  The 
parameter columns are checked for proper order and correct heading labels and 
formatted to the correct decimal places using the "column reformat" macro 
supplied by the CDMO.  Reasons for any missing or anomalous data are entered 
directly into the data file and the edited file is saved as a two-week excel 
file.  When an entire month of two-week edited data files have been collected, 
the files are edited and combined into a 1 month excel file using the excel 
import.xls macro. All editing and missing data documentation are also recorded 
in an excel file named "missing data log".  The information in the "missing 
data log" is transferred to the metadata form. The edited and raw files are 
archived on a Sun Sparc 20 workstation and backed up to tape weekly.  Data 
and metadata files are uploaded via ftp to the CDMO. The person responsible 
for the data management is Michelle Cordrey.


3.  Research Objectives

The Tijuana Estuarine Research Reserve is impacted heavily by both 
periodic raw sewage outflows and urban development. Only about a quarter of the 
reserve's 2,531 acres are tidally influenced, with few channels deep
enough for datalogger deployment.  Two stations were originally set up:  a
treatment station was set up close to the mouth on the Southern end of the 
Oneonta Slough, while a control station was set up on the northern end of 
Oneonta Slough.  The treatment station location was chosen because it would be 
the site most affected by sewage outflow. Deployment at the treatment station, 
however, was continually halted by both shifting sediment and massive wracks of 
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), which would often bury the deployment set-up on 
incoming tides.  After a number of different deployment equipment designs were 
implemented, with no success, logging at this site was terminated.
        
We currently have four YSI datalogger stations installed at the reserve. 
The siting of the stations is designed to investigate spatial gradients of water 
quality parameters across the reserve as well as document the water quality 
changes over time to areas in the reserve which have been restored to increase 
tidal flushing.  The original control station in the northern end of Oneonta 
Slough is still in place.  The second station, Tidal Linkage, is located in the 
North arm of the reserve in a constructed channel designed to increase tidal 
exchange in that portion of the reserve. Data logging at the Tidal Linkage 
station began in May 1997 but has not been continuous due to episodic 
sedimentation events. A third datalogger station is located at the inlet to the 
Model Marsh, a recently constructed 20-acre restoration site in the southern arm 
of the estuary.  The Model Marsh was opened to tidal flushing in February 2000 
and data logging at the station began in October 2000. The most recent station 
to be added was the River Channel.  The station is located on a tidally 
influenced section of the Tijuana River, the largest source of freshwater to the 
reserve. Data logging at the River Channel station began in August 2002.


4. Research Methods (Dataloggers)

Dataloggers at the Model Marsh, Oneonta Slough, and River Channel stations are 
deployed using a 4-inch diameter PVC pipe that is strapped vertically to two 
"rail" style fence posts driven into the sediment.  Multiple 1.5 inch holes have 
been drilled around the bottom of the tube to permit unrestricted water flow to 
the sensors.  During deployment the datalogger units are then placed into and 
rest on a bolt fixed across the bottom of the tubes.  Dataloggers are deployed 
at the Tidal Linkage station are deployed horizontally, in a 4-inch diameter pvc 
pipe that is fastened to 4 copper pipes that have been driven into the sediment 
until refusal.  

The sampling period is two weeks for non-EDS loggers and between three and four 
weeks when using EDS loggers, with measurements taken every 30 minutes.
Measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (percent
saturation), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), temperature, turbidity and water level
are recorded.  At the end of each two week period, the YSI data logger units
are brought back to the laboratory for downloading, cleaning and recalibration 
and are usually redeployed in the field within 24 to 48 hours. These procedures 
are carried out according to the methods described in the YSI Operations Manual 
(see sections 3 and 7). Calibration standards for specific conductivity and 
turbidity are purchased from YSI and pH standards are purchased pre-made from 
VWR scientific.  The QA/QC procedures for the collected data are followed as 
given in the CDMO Operations Manual version 4.0.


5.  Site location and character

General site Characteristics (TJE)
a) Tidal exchange (extremes): approx. -2 +7 MLLW,
b) Salinity: 4 ppt (extreme rain events) to 38 ppt
c) Latitude and longitude:  32 deg. 34 min. N, 117 deg. 07 min. W 
d) Potential impacts: storm drain runoff from military airfield and adjacent 
residential areas, occasional sewage spills (10-15 MGD) into the Tijuana River 
from Mexico.  The area surrounding the estuary is heavily developed by 
residential housing as is the watershed which drains into the estuary.  
Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico.  The North Eastern section of 
the reserve is bordered by a military helicopter training base.  Vegetation in 
the area is dominated by common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) and Pacific 
cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).
e) The dominant freshwater source to the estuary is the Tijuana River, which 
drains a 4,483 sq. km watershed. Streamflows in the river vary considerably 
from season to season and year to year with no flow during many months with 
a mean annual discharge of .82 cubic meters per second (cms).  Additional 
freshwater sources are stormdrains located mostly in the northern arm of the 
estuary. The entire estuary is shallow and has a relatively small tidal prism 
(0.36 Mm3) so even low freshwater flows result in reduced salinity throughout 
the reserve.  Estimated residence times for freshwater entering the estuary 
vary from 7 hours to a few days depending on the tidal and mouth conditions.  
Rainfall within the watershed accounts for most of the freshwater entering the 
reserve with 90 percent of the mean annual rainfall falling between November 
and April.  Discharges of freshwater with untreated sewage occur year round 
although these have decreased with the construction of binational water 
treatment plant.
 
Specific Site characteristics: Oneonta Slough (OS)
a) Orientation of site:  The Datalogger station is located on the upper portion 
of Oneonta Slough.  The channel runs North to South and is located on the 
northwestern edge of the reserve. Latitude is 32 deg  34 min 04.8 sec N, 
longitude is 117 deg 07 min 52.3 sec W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom directly below the datalogger is approx. 
0.55m below Mean Sea Level.
c) Channel width is approx. 20 meters.  Datalogger site is located 1km from 
mouth
d) Bottom type: sand and sediment
e) Area adjacent to west side of channel is developed. There is a 50 meter 
buffer of natural vegetation between development and the channel.  Area adjacent 
to east side of channel is relatively natural.
f) Direct impacts are estimated to be runoff from streets into channel during 
rain events.

Specific Site Characteristics:  Model Marsh (MM)
a) Orientation of site: The datalogger station is located in the middle of a 
natural channel which runs north to south.  The channel is approximately 20 
meters north of a newly constructed 20 acre mudflat restoration area in
the southern section or the reserve.  Latitude is 32 deg 32 min 52.5 sec N,
longitude is 117 deg 07 min 22.9 sec W for data collected January and February 
2003. As of March 13, 2003 site was relocated to lat:  32deg 32min 
52.1sec long: 117deg 7min 22.5sec due to heavy sedimentation. 
b) The elevation of the channel bottom: -.39 NGVD (last reading: 2001)
c) Channel width: 5 meters
d) Bottom type:  Mostly mud with some sand

Specific Site Characteristics:  Tidal Linkage (TL)
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger station is located in the middle of the
constructed channel known as the Tidal Linkage.  The channel runs Northwest
to Southwest and is located adjacent to the visitor's center in the
northeastern section of the reserve. Latitude is 32 deg 34 min 27.9 sec N,
longitude is 117 deg 07 min 37.8 sec W. 
b) The elevation of the channel bottom: no survey data available.
c) Channel width:  Approximately 5 meters at both the old and new sites
d) Bottom type: very fine mud.

Specific Site Characteristics:  River Channel (RC)
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger station is located in the main channel of 
the Tijuana River, the main drainage of the watershed. The channel runs East to 
West. Latitude is 32 deg 33 min 28.4 sec N, longitude is 117 deg 06 min 21.8 sec 
W, 
b) The elevation of the channel bottom: no survey data available.
c) Channel width:  Approximately 10 meters
d) Bottom type: mostly sand, some mud.

b)	01/01/2003 00:00:00 to 01/07/2003 13:00:00, pH values are missing due to 
probe malfunction. Data were removed by technician.

c)	01/01/2003 - 01/07/2003 and 01/10/2003 - 01/14/2003, higher than average 
turbidity values were recorded. No probable cause found.

e)	01/01/2003 00:00:00 - 01/07/2003 15:00:00, Time values offset by -1min, 
data were corrected - closest 00:00 or 00:30 min interval.

TL
a)	Heavy sedimentation, redesign of the deployment holder and holder 
installation at the station prevented deployment from 01/01/2003 through 
01/31/2003.


February 2003

OS
a)	02/08/2003 through 02/28/2003, lower than average specific conductivity 
and salinity and higher than average turbidity values were recorded. Likely 
correlated to rain events. See section 14 for rain event details.

b)	Negative or 0 depth values were recorded during the following dates and 
times.  Sensors were not out of water so data were not removed.
02/24/2003 13:00:00 - 14:00:00

c)	02/25/2003 8:30:00 - 02/28/2003 23:30:00, Turbidity values higher than 
average. Post deployment calibration check showed wiper was not rotating 
properly which may have caused higher than average readings in addition to 
effects of rain event.

MM
a)	Data deleted for the following dates and times due to heavy sedimentation, 
which caused site to be relocated for the March deployment.
02/12/2003 12:30:00 - 02/17/2003 15:00:00

12. Missing Data

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks

a) There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded small 
negative values (-0001 and -0002). Because turbidity has a range of accuracy of 
+/-2 NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted these values in any way. 

b) Hypoxic (< 20%) and super-saturation (>100%) dissolved oxygen events were 
recorded at all sites. The events were cyclic (primarily diel) and the duration 
of each event was less than 24hrs.
