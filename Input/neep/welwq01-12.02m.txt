2).  Entry verification:

The data are directly downloaded in the YSI-PC6000 format (as a .dat file) and 
the Comma Delimited format (as a .csv file) from the dataloggers to a PC lap-
top.  The data are reviewed using the PC6000 software (Eco-Watch).  Graphs and 
basic statistics are then generated with the Eco-Watch program and the 
information is printed out for each data file.  These graphs are used to 
determine any obvious data outliers and sonde and/or probe malfunction.  All 
downloaded data files from the dataloggers (both raw unedited .dat and .csv 
files) are then transferred via disk to a Dell Inspiron 4100, where all files 
are reviewed and formatted for CDMO and stored.  Here the raw unedited .csv data 
files are imported into Microsoft Excel 2000.  After a complete month of data 
has been recorded, each file is ready to review, which requires several steps.  
The NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macros are used for all data.  

The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format column 
widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file 
from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, 
in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing 
users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly 
basis. 

A data file is created (from the merged raw unedited .csv data files) in Excel 
format with a full month of data.  The first step is to make sure that the 
parameter columns are in the correct order, specified by the NERR CDMO.  If any 
parameters are not collected due to probe failure or other causes, the cells 
with this missing data are filled in with periods (.) and documented and 
explained in the appropriate section of the metadata.  Secondly, missing dates 
and times are inserted in the data file where data were not collected due to 
maintenance, sonde failure, etc., and the cells with this missing data are 
filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in the appropriate 
section of the metadata.  The first NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is then run to 
determine if there are any missing dates and times; and if so these missing 
dates and times are inserted.  Next, the second NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is 
used to find and filter all data readings outside the sonde specification 
measuring range for each parameter.  Here the outlier data generated by the 
second macro are examined and determined as either explained or unexplained 
anomalies, as specified by NERR CDMO Operations Manual (Version 4.0).  All 
anomalous data (explained and unexplained) are documented and explained in the 
appropriate sections of the metadata.  The explained anomalous data are then 
removed from the data file and replaced by periods.  The unexplained anomalous 
data are investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, 
instrument diagnostics, and Eco-Watch printouts.  If these data are rejected 
from the file then these are removed and replaced by periods.  Lastly, the third 
and final NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is used to reformat all the columns in the 
data file to the correct number of significant digits.  After this last step, 
once the file has been completely formatted and edited as specified by NERR 
CDMO, the file is saved as a Tab delimited (.txt) text file and sent by FTP to 
the CDMO.  The metadata form is also submitted with the data file to the 
CDMO, sent also as a text file (text only with line breaks).  Jim Dochtermann 
and Scott Orringer are responsible for this task of entry verification with the 
analyses of suspect and anomalous data.  Michele Dionne supervises, proofs and 
answers questions with the evaluation of suspect and anomalous data.

available.



3).  Research objectives:

	The Webhannet River estuary is located in proximity to heavily used 
beaches in Wells, Maine.  It has a shoreline that is highly developed with 
residential and commercial structures.  The estuary receives water from a 14 sq. 
mi. watershed that is well forested.  We are measuring variations in hydrologic 
variables in the Webhannet River estuary at the Head of Tide and at the Inlet.  
Data from Head of Tide will integrate surface and ground water inputs (from both 
point and non-point sources) from the freshwater watershed into the estuary.  
Data from the Inlet will integrate surface and ground water inputs from the 
freshwater watershed and the estuarine watershed.  Differences in data between 
the Head of Tide and the Inlet will indicate inputs from the estuarine portion 
of the watershed (on the ebb tide), and inputs from the Gulf of Maine on the 
flood tide.  The instruments will track runoff events via salinity, and will 
measure pollutant-carrying sediment particles via turbidity.  Our working 
hypothesis is that the freshwater watershed is the primary source of sediment 
and therefore potential NPS pollutants in the estuary.  These two variables will 
indicate the potential for non-point source pollutants to enter the estuary, and 
whether they are of upland, estuarine, or Gulf of Maine origin.  Other variables 
measured by the data loggers (DO, temperature, pH, specific conductivity, and 
water level) will provide important baseline data to track changes in the 
estuary's physicochemical parameters over the long term.  These variables can be 
affected by changes in human water use, and by natural or human induced changes 
in inlet and river channel morphology, climate, and organic loadings.  The Inlet 
site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term 
monitoring site.  The Mile Road site is our creek site. The Head of Tide site is 
relatively unimpacted, located just east of the Route One Bridge, and is our 
roving site. The Little River Mouth site is our comparative system site. 


4).  Research Methods

	The Wells NERR YSI monitoring program began in April 1995 at one site 
(Head of Tide site-HT) and May 1995 at a second site (Inlet site-IN) in the 
Webhannet River estuary. Two additional sites were added in 2002, Mile Road 
site-ML began in March in the Webhannet River estuary and Little River Mouth-LM 
in April in the Little River Estuary. The four data loggers are installed with 
bottom moorings, as described below.  Both data loggers have 1/4 inch black 
vector mesh placed on the outside (using rubber bands) of the sonde guard to 
prevent fouling and unwanted animals.  All deployment structures (PVC tubes) 
described below are labeled with the Wells NERR information.

*IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN) where our telemetry unit is 
stationed: A new vented level YSI 6600 with its new vented level cable was 
deployed to collect its first data on 5/4/99 at 12:00.  The YSI telemetry unit 
began collecting its first data on 3/16/98 at 10:30:00. 

The Inlet site (IN) deployment methods are different than the other sites
 (HT,ML,LM), due to the installation of a YSI telemetry unit.  A 23 foot, 4 inch 
diameter high grade PVC tube was installed against a dock piling.  Four steel 
flat bars with bolts were used to attach this 23 foot PVC tube against the dock 
piling.  A 3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer was glued on the inside bottom of the 
PVC tube to allow the sonde to sit exactly 1.0 meter (3.28  ft) off the bottom.  
Several vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A PVC threaded cap 
screws in to the threaded top of the PVC tube, also for security.  A hole was 
created in the PVC cap to allow the sonde to hook up with the telemetry unit 
using the 50 foot cable.  The collection of data parameters at the Inlet (IN) 
site are slightly different then at the roving sites, due to the telemetry 
unit installation.  Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen due 
to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane and probe 
fouling.  Battery power is not needed anymore within the sonde itself (although, 
battery power is needed during calibrations and downloading) at the time of 
deployment at this site because of the telemetry unit's solar batter power.  
Measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and turbidity are recorded at 30 minute 
intervals throughout the deployment period.  Time, date, and battery voltage are 
no longer programmed to be recorded by the sonde, since these parameters are 
already programmed with the Eco-Watch Program (see YSI's Eco-Watch Users Guide).

	The other sites, Head of Tide (HT), Mile Road (ML), and Little River Mouth 
(LM) are deployed similarly, except for sonde height off the bottom (see below).  
This site uses a 5 foot, 4 inch diameter high grade PVC tube.  The PVC tube is 
attached to a 12 foot, heavy steel sign post using a stainless steel bolt at the 
bottom of the tube, a stainless steel cable wrap at the top, and several thick 
electrical cable ties in between.  The steel sign post was pounded in about 6 
feet into the river bottom, such that the bottom of the PVC tube was flat on the 
river bottom.  The PVC tube has one 3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer glued on the 
inside bottom of the PVC tube to allow the sonde to sit exactly at a certain 
height off the bottom (see below).  Several vertical holes, representative of 
the sonde guard, were cut out the circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe 
to allow water flow to the probes.  An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes 
is placed through two created slits about a half of foot from the top of the PVC 
tube.  A stainless steel wire (1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two 
stainless steel clips; and to one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde 
deployment and retrieval.  A marine lock is attached through the other end of 
the "L" shaped steel bar to hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for 
security.  A flotation buoy is tied to the PVC tubes incase the deployment 
structure ever gets dislodged.  The deployment depth for these sites is such 
that the probe-end of the data logger is secured 0.30 meters (1.0 ft) off the 
bottom.	

	Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen for the data sonde 
due to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane, probe 
fouling, and limited battery power.  Measurements of temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and 
turbidity are recorded at 30 minute intervals throughout the deployment period.

	After the deployment period, the data logger is brought back into the 
Wells Reserve Laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and calibration.  These 
procedures are carried out to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.  
Calibration standards are needed and used for only specific conductivity (10 
mS/cm), pH (buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10), and turbidity (100 NTU).  
Conductivity and pH standards are purchased from Fisher Scientific.  Turbidity 
standards are purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc. (Redwood City, CA).  
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced and sit 6-24 hours before each 
deployment.  After approximately 6-24 hours of down time for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration, the YSI Data logger is redeployed for another 
sampling period.  Also, with our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the 
amount of time of missing data from calibrations and maintenance for this site.

The use of the newest (Version 3.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 
System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water Quality 
Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in December 2000 when they became 
available.
	

5).  Site location and character    

	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York County, 
within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and faces the Atlantic 
Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 miles) south of Portland, 
Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, Massachusetts.  The Reserve 
encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of Maine coastline of tidally-flushed 
wetlands, riparian and transitional upland fields and forests within the Little 
River Estuary and the larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in 
the sandy glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers empty 
into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles along the 
Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river's inlet are double spit barrier beaches 
attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system in the Webhannet River Estuary 
is approximately 5 sq. km and is composed of large intertidal marshes 
(predominantly S. patens and S. alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, 
and tidal channels.  The watershed for the Webhannet River estuary covers an 
area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 streams, brooks or creeks, which enter 
the estuary.  These tributaries flow across sand and gravel deposits near the 
headwaters and the impermeable sandy muds of the Presumpscot Formation in the 
lower reaches. The watershed for the Little River estuary covers an area of 84 
sq. km and has a total of 2 tributaries. The backbarrier system in the Little 
River Estuary is approximately 2.51 sq. km and is composed of large intertidal 
marshes (predominantly S. patens and S. alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud 
flats, and tidal channels.  The Webhannet River is connected to the ocean via 
Wells Inlet, which has a spring tidal prism of 28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). 
The Little River is connected to the ocean by an unstructured, double spit 
system and is one of the few tidal inlets along the southern Maine coast that is 
not stabilized by either natural outcrops or artificial jetties. The force and 
volume of tidal action affect the salinity level of both rivers.  In the Wells 
region, the annual mean wave height is almost 20 inches.  These estuarine 
systems are dominated by semi-diurnal tides having a range of 8.5 to 9.8 feet.  
The volume of freshwater influx into both estuaries is moderate to low (on the 
order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), especially in the summer, because of the 
rivers' relatively small drainage areas and the presence of deep glacial 
deposits.  The relatively low flows from these two rivers taken in with the 20 
inch per year average runoff of the area surrounding the estuaries combine to 
form a fresh water flow which is dwarfed by tidal flushing.  Twelve-foot tides 
dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet estuary, which has a drainage area 
of 14.1 square miles. The Merriland River and Branch Brook meet south of Route 9 
to form the Little River which drains an area of 10.75 sq. miles. The Webhannet 
estuary, fed by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and 
greatly developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for comparison with 
the relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land use of the Webhannet 
estuary include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh water, and tidal marsh; a 
total of 63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 18.6% for developed land compared 
to a total of 5.7% development in the Little River estuary (WNERR RMA 1996; 
Holden 1997). 

	There are three sampling sites in the Webhannet River estuary.  These are 
located at the Head of Tide, Mile Road, and at the Inlet.  The tidal range at 
each of these sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.  
 
	The Head of Tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just 
downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 
deg 17' 54.25227" Latitude, 70 deg 35' 13.82728" Longitude).  Route One is used 
heavily with traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  
This site has soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide 
depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean 
of 3.6 ppt.  These headwaters of the Webhannet are relatively undeveloped.  
This site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is our 
roving site.

	The Mile Road site is located 3.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, on 
Mile Road roughly 300' north of the bridge (N43 deg 18.300' Latitude,W 70 deg 
34.583 Longitude).  This site has soft mud and a rocky substrate, and the low 
and high tide depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is  3.6-33.4 
ppt, with a mean of  27.0 ppt.

	The Inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the 
Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19' 12.44804" Latitude, 70 deg 33' 13.82728" 
Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an extensive wetland/salt 
marsh area which is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most 
recently dredged in 1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing 
and recreational boats.  The mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the 
Atlantic Ocean.  This channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a 
predominately sand substrate and is characterized by strong current during 
incoming and outgoing tides.  The maximum depth of the Inlet site is 3 meters. 
The salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean of 31 ppt.  The Inlet site is 
heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term monitoring site.

	The Little River Mouth site is located .4 miles of the Wells Reserve. Due 
to problems with heavy sediment movement in the inlet of the Little River, we 
were forced to relocate the site (see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes). The first 
location (N 43 deg 20.176 Latitude, W 70 deg 32.497 Longitude) was located in 
the main channel of the river, just inland of a spit, beside a bank. The second 
location (N 43 deg 20.083 Latitude, W 70 deg 32.585 Longitude) was located 1/8 
mi. southwest of the first site, within an inlet, just inland of a spit. The 
second site was located in an area of much lower current than the first site and 
often drains completely during low tides. It was also placed within a pool next 
to incipient low marsh peat that retains calm water during low tides. The tidal 
range of the Little River estuary is 2.6-3.0 meters (Mariano and FitzGerald, 
1988). Both sites were abandoned (see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes). The Little 
River sites existed in a shallow and relatively pristine system with a sandy to 
mud bottom and a salinity range of 0 - 32 ppt. There are two major freshwater 
inputs, the Merriland and Branch Brook Rivers, which converge to form the Little 
River. 

6).  Data collection period:

	The Webhannet River Head of Tide (HT) site data collection was re-deployed 
(after being pulled in every December from 1995-2001) on March 12, 15:00 and 
pulled after December 9, 11:00 for the winter months to prevent ice damage.  
This site gets a large amount of ice coverage from December through late 
March. The Webhannet River Mile Road (ML) site data collection was re-deployed 
(following a CICEET project) on March 19, 9:30 and pulled after December 9, 
10:30 for the winter months to prevent ice damage. This site gets a large amount 
of ice coverage from December through late March. The Webhannet River Inlet (IN) 
site data collection began May 29, 1995, 13:00.  The IN datalogger is ongoing 
throughout the year and is considered our long-term monitoring site, as this 
site remains relatively ice-free. The Little River Mouth (LM) site data 
collection began April 2, 10:00 and ended July 9, 16:00 due to high 
levels of sediment deposition in the mouth of the estuary.

WELLS NATIONAL ESTUARINE RESEARCH RESERVE RESEARCH AT THE RESERVE for 2002 
(Please visit our website: www.wellsreserve.org/research.htm for further 
information on the Wells NERR research program) :

The Research Program at the Wells NERR conducts and supports research, 
monitoring, workshops, and research/resource management planning of relevance at 
local, regional and national levels.  The overall aim of our work is to produce 
science-based information needed to sustain or restore Gulf of Maine coastal 
habitats and resources, especially those found in salt marsh estuaries and 
watersheds.  During 2000-2001 twenty-three different studies (involving 79 
scientists, students, and staff  from the Reserve, 26 academic institutions and 
19 resource management groups) focused on several related themes:1) the quality 
of water resources  in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds 2) land conservation 
strategies to protect coastal watersheds 3) factors controlling salt marsh 
accretion, erosion and plant community vigor 4) the value of salt marsh as 
habitat for fish, shellfish and birds,  and 5) restoration of salt marsh habitat 
degraded through human actions.

Estuarine Water  Resource Quality

Water quality is monitored continuously at several stations with automated 
instruments as part of a NERRS systemwide monitoring program, as well as 
bimonthly at 15-20 stations through our WET volunteer monitoring program.  The 
WET program also monitors two important biological parameters: fecal coliform 
bacterial contamination (an indicator of human health risk) and phytoplankton 
productivity (an indicator of estuarine health).  These data have 1) allowed us 
to identify several bacterial "hot spots" that we will be working to eliminate, 
2) are used to identify and open areas safe for shellfishing, and 3) have 
uncovered a relation between tides and low dissolved oxygen (a stressful 
condition for marine life) that needs further study.  Our water quality work has 
contributed to the designation of several Priority Watersheds in coastal 
Southern Maine by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 

Coastal Conservation Strategies

The Coastal Mosaic Project is a new program developed in response to requests 
for support from the conservation community to increase the quantity, quality 
and ecological integrity of conserved lands in our region.  Research staff 
organize and facilitate meetings, workshops, and communications for 18 partner 
conservation groups.  A key element of the Project is the Conservation Resource 
Center, a Reserve staffed GIS facility with a growing database able to 
provide maps of property, natural features and other data needed to develop 
effective conservation goals and strategies.  The Project is nearing completion 
of conservation lands maps for 13 Southern Maine coastal towns, and is 
undertaking an initiative to develop coastal watershed conservation strategies 
for 12 coastal watersheds within these towns.  The Reserve has a particular 
interest in educating communities about the ecologic and economic benefits of 
land conservation, especially along estuarine and riverine shorelines.

Salt Marsh Habitats and Communities

Factors that control the dynamics and vigor of salt marsh plant communities and 
marsh peat formation consequently determine the ability of a salt marsh to 
persist in the face of sea level rise.  Through a combination of experimental 
manipulations and long term monitoring, a number of multi-year studies are 
currently producing data to answer questions concerning the sustainability of 
salt marsh habitats in this region.  These studies are looking at nutrient-plant 
relations, plant community responses to physical and hydrologic disturbance, and 
the relative contribution of short-term natural events (e.g. storms) and human 
activities (dredging, tidal restriction) on patterns of sediment accretion and 
erosion.  The Reserve's marshes and beaches are already among the best studied 
sites in the U.S. with regard to long term accretion and erosion (over thousands 
of years).

HABITAT VALUE FOR FISH, SHELLFISH AND BIRDS

The Reserve combines long-term monitoring with periodic surveys and short-term 
experiments to identify species and measure trends and changes in populations of 
fish, crustaceans, clams and birds.   We have 10 years of data on upland and 
shore birds with which to assess the status of resident and migratory avian 
populations, and 8 years of wading bird data that we use as a gross level 
indicator of salt marsh health, which appears to be stable.  Our periodic 
larval, juvenile and adult fish surveys have produced the best available data 
for fish utilization of salt marsh estuaries in the Gulf of Maine.  In the 
coming year we plan to develop a long-term monitoring program for finfish that 
will be coordinated with other sites within the Gulf of Maine and along the east 
coast.  Since 1994 we have been conducting surveys and field experiments to look 
at the survival and growth of hatchery seed, juvenile and adult softshell clam 
with regard to habitat characteristics and predation by the invasive green crab.

Salt Marsh Degradation and Restoration

 Salt marsh ecosystems in the Gulf of Maine have sustained themselves in the 
face of sea-level rise and other natural disturbances for nearly five thousand 
years.  Since colonial times large areas of salt marsh (up to half of the total 
area) have been lost through diking, draining and filling.  Today, the remaining 
marshland is fairly well protected from outright destruction, but during the 
past 100 years, and especially since the 1950's, salt marshes have been divided 
into fragments by roads, causeways, culverts and tide gates.  Most of these 
fragments have severly restricted tidal flow, leading to chronic habitat 
degradation and greatly reduced access for fish and other marine species.  Since 
1991, the Wells Reserve has been studying the impact of these restrictions on 
salt marsh functions and values, and the response of salt marshes to tidal 
restoration.  We have been working to promote an awareness of the damage being 
done and the benefits of salt marsh restoration throughout the Gulf of Maine.

Research Program Update:
In addition to the Reserve-sponsored projects outlined above, numerous visiting 
investigators will be involved in on-site research.  Topics include: the effects 
of land use, sea level, and climate on estuarine productivity; the relationship 
between soil nutrients and plant community patterns; the influence of soil 
salinity on plant community interactions; the effect of tidal restriction on 
marsh peat accretion; the comparative ecology of fringe marshes and back barrier 
marshes; habitat use by upland birds, and the ecology of lyme disease.

• The Wells NERR Research Dept. is working on the following projects:  
"Ecological processes, energy pathways, and the impact of human 
activities on Maine marsh-estuarine secondary production: a salt marsh 
panne model". We used stable isotopic tracers (15N additions and 
naturally abundant 13C) coupled with secondary production measurements 
(nekton, invertebrates) to track energy flow on the high marsh surface 
in southern Maine salt marsh systems. The project is still under way.

"Ecological Functions of Fringing Salt Marshes Susceptible to Oil Spills 
in Casco Bay, Maine". We examined the ecological function of 9 different 
fringing marsh systems in Casco Bay that ranged from undisturbed to 
disturbed. Physical parameters measured included sedimentation rates, 
total suspended solids, and tidal range. Biological parameters included 
primary production, macroinvertebrate community composition and 
secondary production (4cm sediment cores), and resident and transient 
nekton community composition (fyke net). The project is still under way.

"BENTHIC HABITAT CORRELATES OF JUVENILE FISH DISTRIBUTION IN THE BIGELOW 
BIGHT AND ADJACENT ESTUARIES: LINKAGES BETWEEN FISH, HABITATS, SUBSTRATE 
AND HUMAN ACTIVITY". This project was a collaboration between the Wells 
N.E.R.R. and several members of the local fishing community. Through the 
use of beam trawls, gill nets, fish traps, van veen ponar, and a 
sediment profile imager (SPI camera), we are attempting to correlate 
benthic habitat type to juvenil groundfish an dinvertebrate assemblages 
in estuarine, nearshore, and offshore habitat. Stations were also 
established near dredge spoil dump sites as well as sweage outflow to 
determine the impacts of human activity on the coast to benthic habitat. 
The project is still under way.

• The Wells NERR Research Dept. also completed the work on the following 
project: 
In partnership with the York Rivers Association and the Town of York, the Wells 
Reserve conducted a survey of the York River watershed.  In this survey, 
volunteers looked for sources of pollution within a 250-foot buffer of the river 
and its tributaries (erosion, trash and debris and runoff from roads and lawns 
could have a negative impact on water quality).  Most pollutants entering water 
bodies come from such undefined sources.  Therefore, this type of survey is 
the best way to begin to address the problems of pollution in a water body.  The 
idea of the project was to work with the community and landowners to help them 
understand the problems that come from these types of pollution and learn 
activities they might be able to do on their own land that would help prevent 
this pollution from entering the water.  The results of the survey will become 
part of a Watershed Management Plan to improve and restore the water quality of 
the York River.

•The Wells NERR Research Dept. is involved with the following CICEET* 
Projects-

I. Project Title: Estuarine Responses to Dredging: Analysis of Sedimentary and 
Morphological Change in Back Barrier Marsh to Aid Local Management and Develop a 
Regional Management Tool Principal Investigator (s): Michele Dionne, Wells NERR, 
ME; Duncan Fitzgerald, Boston University; Joe Kelley, University of Maine; David 
Burdick and Larry Ward, University of New Hampshire

Management Issue: Coastal management tool for assessing the impacts of dredging 
in estuaries. Project Summary: An adequate supply of sediment is essential for 
maintaining salt marshes.  Human activities, such as channel dredging and tidal 
restriction due to road construction, can alter water flows in estuaries and 
result in dramatic changes in salt marsh sediment supply, affecting the speed of 
salt marsh erosion.  The objective of this project is to determine the impact of 
dredging and tidal restriction on salt marshes in the Wells NERR.  A digital 
coastal management guide will be created on CD ROM, providing coastal managers 
with useful conceptual models for predicting the impacts of dredging and other 
activities that affect water flow and sediment deposition in salt marshes.

II. Project Title: Microbial Source Tracking in Two Southern Maine Watersheds. A 
two year project written by Maine Sea Grant associate Kristen Whiting-Grant, and 
funded by Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental 
Technology (CICEET), involving Wells NERR, UNH Jackson Estuarine Lab (JEL), USM 
Muskie School, AmeriCorps and the Maine Conservation Corps. We are pioneering 
the use inMaine of genetic analysis as a means of determining the source species 
associated with bacterial contamination in the Webhannet andLittle River 
Estuary. Volunteers collect water samples from streams and the estuaries, staff 
test for and isolate E. coli. 
At JEL, a genetic technique (ribotyping) creates a genetic fingerprint of the 
bacteria which is compared to known sources. The project is still underway.

Mile Road:
a) Small negative and/or zero turbidity values were recorded throughout the 
following time span: 12/1 7:00 to 12/9 4:30 (logging period recorded 131 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error or faulty probe. These 
data were not deleted.
b) The following high positive turbidity value was collected, and this suspect 
data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values were bad.
Date		Time		Turb
12/04/2002	11:00:00	1276
c) The following are shallow negative and/or zero depth data (34 values with a 
range of 0.0 to -0.22 m; mean of -0.07m).  Sonde probes suspected to be 
underwater as other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted:
12/1	1:00-3:00, 13:30-16:00
12/2	2:00-4:30, 15:00-17:00
12/3	3:30-4:30
12/5	19:00, 19:30
12/7	20:00-21:30
12/8	8:00, 8:30, 21:00
d) No data from 12/9 10:30 to 12/31 23:30. This datalogger was pulled for the 
year (winter months) to prevent ice damage.

12).  Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14).  Other Remarks/Notes:

A) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): where our telemetry unit is 
stationed: A new vented level YSI 6600 with its new vented level cable was 
deployed to collect its first data on 5/4/99 at 12:00.  The YSI telemetry unit 
began collecting its first data on 3/16/98 at 10:30:00 (see Section 4-Research 
Methods). The telemetry unit failed some time between 02/03/02 and 02/26/02. 
Water contaminated the vented level cable and shorted out the attached vented 
level 6600 sonde. Both the cable and sonde were sent back for repair and 
returned in September. The cable was then re-attached and the sonde deployed but 
there has been no communication to the field boxes since.

B) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): For all data collected from 
2/26 11:30 through 9/4 11:30, a non-vented YSI 6600 was used.

C) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): In early 2002, the 
datasonde was improperly programmed. The interval setting was confused with the 
start up time as adjustments were being made to allow for the DO probe warm up 
time. This caused the sonde to take a reading every 29 minutes, causing the data 
set to be off more and more each day. Importing of the file in this way caused 
there to be extra rows of data. In order to have a correct monthly file of data, 
the technicians edited the raw file to adjust for these extra rows of data. Both 
the original raw file and the edited raw file are being stored on the CDMO 
server. Please contact reserve for further questions. 

D) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE LITTLE RIVER MOUTH SITE (LM): The deployment 
for this site was the first ever for the SWMP program at the Wells NERR. We 
deployed the sonde in the mouth of the Little River on 4/01/02 and upon 
retrieval on 4/23/02 we noticed a serious accumulation of sediment that buried 
the probes of the sonde. We located another site within an inlet adjacent to the 
main channel and deployed the sonde again on 5/06/02. We had several successful 
deployment periods at this new site but found the sonde buried again on 7/09/02. 
We needed time to re-evaluate the situation and did not deploy again at the 
Little River Mouth for the rest of the year.

E) The use of the newest (Version 3.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(NERR) System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water 
Quality Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in December '00 when they 
became available.

F) With our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the amount of time of 
missing data from calibrations and maintenance for all sites.  Some months have 
no missing data from the use of this extra sonde.

G) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
