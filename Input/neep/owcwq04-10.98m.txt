Old Woman Creek (OWC) NERR Site Water Quality Metadata

2. Entry verification:

		The data were directly downloaded from the YSI data loggers into the 
YSI PC6000 program in the PC. The data were graphed and visually checked for any 
obvious outliers. The data were then transferred to an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and spaces. All three CDMO 
macros were used to QA/QC the data.  Missing data were inserted into the 
spreadsheet and denoted by periods. The data files were then checked for 
readings that were outside the instrument range.  These data were removed and 
replaced with a period. An explanation for the missing and the deleted data is 
included in this meta data sheet.  The files were then transfered along with the 
associated metadata sheet by disk to the CDMO.  The files are archived at OWC. 
Dr. David Klarer is responsible for both data logger deployment and data 
management.


	
3.Research Objectives:

	Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two week 
periods at two sites within the Old Woman Creek estuary- one in the upper 
reaches at State Route 2 and the other near the mouth, just south of State Route 
6. The purpose of this monitoring program is to document the role of Great Lakes 
estuaries in mitigating storm flow that passes through them.  

4. Research methods:

	The YSI monitoring program began on 1 April, 1997 at both sites.  Prior to 
deployment of the data loggers, a 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was bolted to a metal 
sign post that had been driven into the sediment.  Each pipe had 4 rows of holes 
drilled into it spanning the area of the probe guard on the data logger so that 
the probes would have direct contact with the surrounding waters.  The data 
logger at site SU is .47 meters above the bottom, while the YSI at site WM is 
0.32 meters above the bottom.  Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity, and 
specific conductance readings are taken when the instrument is pulled at each 
site. On alternate weeks, the data loggers are pulled.  The data is retrieved 
from each data logger and each data logger is recalibrated (according to the 
directions in the YSI Operations Manual)  before being returned to the field.  
Conductivity, pH (2 point calibration), and turbidity (2 point calibration) was 
calibrated using 
commercial standards.


5. Site location and character:

	Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
southern shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio (Latitude 
41 22' N; longitude 82 31' W). 
	The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) 41 22’ 57” N, 82 30’ 52” W site 
is very near the southern boundary of the reserve.  The data logger is sited 
near a concrete piling of the eastbound Ohio State Route 2 bridge.  At this site 
the creek is relatively deep and narrow.  Although water direction and flow is 
influenced at this site by changes in Lake Erie water levels, this site doesn¹t 
have direct contact with Lake Erie waters. 
	The data logger at State Route 6 (WM) 41 22’ 56” N, 82 30’ 26” W is very 
close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In this portion of the Reserve, the 
creek is very shallow but extends over a large surface area.  This site  
frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie waters. 

6. Data collection periods:

	Sampling at WM began on April 1, 1998 at 00:00:00.  Sampling for 1998 
ceased at WM site on October 31, 1998 at 23:45:00.  Sampling at SU began on 
April 1, 1998 at 00:00:00.  Sampling ceased at SU site on October 31, 1998 at 
23:45:00.

7. Associated projects: Samples for chemical analysis of the water and 
phytoplankton analysis are 
collected at each site every time the data loggers are changed.

Data columns are separated by tabs.  Each file contains a two line
column header at the top of the page which identifies measurements and 
units for each column.
