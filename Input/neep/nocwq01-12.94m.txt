2)Entry Verification Process:

The data are reviewed using the computer program PC6000 that
accompanies the YSI 6000 datalogger or Microsoft Excel for
Hydrolab DataSonde 3 data. After the file is uploaded from the
water quality instrument, PC6000 is used to plot the data and
perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.
dev.). This information is printed out and attached to the Field
Log for the particular deployment. This printout is used during
file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when
the water quality instrument was removed from the water or those
caused by instrument failure. The data are imported into a
Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative
recordings. When a complete month of data has been recorded the
file is ready for review. The data review includes several steps.
The first step is to format the data so that the parameter
columns are in the correct order and the data have the correct
number of decimal place holders. Secondly, the CDMO Excel 5.0 macro
is used to check for any dates and times that data were not recorded 
due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates
and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted
into the cells where data would normally be. An explanation for
the missing data is recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.
Next, the data are filtered using the CDMO 5.0 Excel macro to find
readings outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range
for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are
removed from the file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).
An explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto
the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside the "normal" range of
water quality for a particular site were investigated for
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks,
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics. If the data are
rejected from the file a period is inserted into the cell(s) and
an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto
the Water Quality Editing Log. The information recorded on the
Water Quality Editing Log is transferred to the metadata form.
The metadata form is then submitted with the data file to the
CDMO.  Paul Grimshaw was responsible for data management in 1994.


3)Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island
and Zeke's Island components of North Carolina's National
Estuarine Research Reserve and are anchored to the bottom of the
selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30 minute intervals for
approximately two week periods. Before a formal protocol was
established for NERR water quality monitoring, hourly data at
Masonboro and Zeke's Island were recorded as detailed in section
12. These sites are relatively unimpacted by manmade
perturbations. 


4)Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March
1992 at the Masonboro Island component, and 19 May 1994 at the
Zeke's Island component. At this time we are only performing long 
term water quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6000 or Hydrolab DataSonde 3 are deployed,
calibration and maintenance is performed following the
manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections
3,4, and 7 and Hydrolab Manual Revision B 4/91, part 3). 
Calibration standards are only required for pH and salinity; all
other parameters are done as described in the manual. Buffer
solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased
premade from a scientific supply house. The salinity standard is
obtained from filtered seawater taken from Masonboro Sound and
analyzed at the Center for Marine Science Research (CMSR)in
Wilmington, NC using an osmometer. The dissolved oxygen membranes
are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24
hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are
recorded in the field observation log. Measurements of DO, pH,
salinity, specific conductance, and temperature are taken with
a calibrated YSI 6000 or other field instruments to check the 
accuracy of the instrumentation before deployment. The water 
quality instrument is placed inside a locked steel
cage, then anchored to the bottom, and chained to a post at the 
monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 
measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity,
dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration,
depth, and pH. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is
either brought back to the laboratory or serviced in the field.
If the water quality instrument is serviced in the field the DO
sensor is either replaced with one that has a new membrane or the
old membrane is wiped with lens paper moistened with tap water to
remove biofouling. The weather and water quality measurements are
again noted in the field observation log. The water quality instrument 
is then uploaded, cleaned and calibrated as noted previously. The 
water quality instrument is then ready to be redeployed.


5)Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine
Research Reserve (from north to south) are: Currituck Banks,
Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island. They are
located along the southeastern coast of the United States in the
Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro and Zeke's
Island components are transferred to the CDMO. The two sites are: 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of
Whiskey Creek, and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a
small navigable channel called Research Creek at 34 deg 09'21.7"
latitude and 77 deg 50'59.9" longitude (GPS position). The site
has a salinity range of 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages
1.2 meters.

2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island
The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal
Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33 deg 56'23.5"
latitude and 77 deg 56'28.1" longitude (GPS position). This site
receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear
River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies
of water. Thus, the ocean tidal input through New Inlet is a
major factor in maintaining the high salinity; however during
rainy periods major drops in salinity may occur. The site has a
salinity range of 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2
meters.


6)Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while
East Cribbing data collection commenced on 19 May 1994. All
monitoring is considered long term.

Site definitions:   RC=Research Creek, Masonboro Island*                   			   EC=East Cribbing, Zeke's Island*

File definitions: site/month/year (ex.: ZI0895 = Zeke's Island
data from August of 1995). 

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zeke’s Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserve’s historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.

12) Notes:

1.  Data from Research Creek during the time period of 1 January  to 4 March 
1994 was collected using a Hydrolab DS3 which was not equipped with a level or 
turbidity sensor. After 4 March 1994 data at Research Creek was collected with 
a YSI 6000 that was not equipped with a turbidity sensor.

2.  Data from East Cribbing was collected using a Hydrolab DS3 that was not 
equipped with a level sensor or turbidity sensor


3.  Data collection began in May at East Cribbing.

4.   Data collection at the Research Creek site from March 4, 1500 to December
were in one hour intervals which were corrected to half hour intervals.

5.   Data collection at the East Cribbing site from May to December
were in one hour intervals which were corrected to half hour intervals.


6.   Data collected from 12/1/95 0038 - 12/8 1538 at Research Creek
was off by 8 minutes from the top and bottom of the hour. The
instruments were programmed to start at the top of the hour,
however there was an unexplainable delay.  Data were corrected
to read on the half hour.
