2. Entry verification:
 	After retrieving and carefully cleaning the dataloggers, they are examined 
to detect any structural damage to the body or to the probes. The DO membrane is 
checked for ruptures and then replaced if needed. The turbidity probe is 
examined to assure that no obstruction affects the wiper and that the sensor is 
clean. Manipulation and observation are registered in the field log for each 
deployment respectively.
	The YSI is connected to a Pentium II 400 MHz IBM compatible computer and 
the data are reviewed using the YSI computer program PC6000 that accompanies the 
YSI 6000 datalogger. The file is uploaded in two formats, one in YSI PC6000 
format and the other in Comma and "" Delimited format then the file is renamed 
to have a ".txt" extension. The YSI Ecowatch for Windows program is used to plot 
the data and delete the pre- and post deployment data that are not in range of 
the other readings. The program is used to perform basic statistical analysis 
(i,e., min., max., mean, std. dev.). This information is printed out with a list 
of data and filed for each station.
	The information obtained from this printout is used during file review to 
detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the datalogger was removed 
from the water or those caused by instrument failure. The data are imported into 
a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative recordings. 
When a complete month of data has been recorded the file is ready for review.
	The data review includes several steps.  The first step is to format the 
data so that the parameter columns are in the correct order.  Secondly, a 
modified Excel 97 version of the CDMO Excel 5.0 macro is used to check and 
determine if there are any dates and times that were not recorded due to 
maintenance, battery failure, or other cause. Missing dates and times are 
inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where data would 
normally be. The reason for the missing data is recorded onto the Missing data 
Log. The data are then formatted so that the parameter columns are in the 
correct size and the data have the correct number of decimal place holders as 
specified by the NERR CDMO. Next, the data are filtered using the CDMO Excel 97 
macro to find readings outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" 
range for the site in question.
	Data outside the instrument range is/are removed from the file and a 
period is inserted to the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing dates and 
time are recorded onto the Missing data Log.  Data that were outside the 
"normal" range of water quality for a particular site is investigated for 
validity based on field observation, QC check, PC6000 printouts, and instrument 
diagnostics. If the datum is/are rejected from the file a period is inserted to 
the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing date and time is recorded onto 
the Missing data Log. The information recorded on the Missing data Log is 
transferred to the metadata form. The metadata form is then submitted with the 
data to the CDMO.  Data is stores in zip disks.  Dr. Pedro Robles, Research 
Coordinator is responsible for the data management.
 
3. Research Objectives:
 	The four dataloggers are deployed at Mar Negro area, major component of 
Jobos Bay Estuarine Research Reserve, and are suspended from a pole at one foot 
from the bottom of the selected site. Measurements are taken at thirty (30) 
minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. The sites are identified as 
representative of areas within the reserve and comparable to the sites that may 
be receiving impact from human activities in the surroundings areas.
	Station number six (6), is located in the proximity of Punta Colchones, 
close to the thermal discharge pipeline, which can be affected by high 
temperatures and sediment resuspension. 
	Station number nine (9), the impacted site, collects water quality data in 
a site associated with runoff from littoral and basin mangroves areas. This 
sampling station is closer to the Electric Power Thermoelectric Plant, which 
makes it subject to runoff and potential spills contamination from this 
industrial facility. Information compiled from historical environmental 
documents indicate that station nine (9) was used as a disposal site for the 
residues of the previously operating sugar mill operation, which might have been 
a high organic input to the sediments.
	Station number ten (10), located in the mangrove lagoon area is the 
reference or unimpacted site.
	Station number eleven (11) is another possible impacted site. Housing 
development that is not provided with sewage treatment facilities are the 
potential source of contaminants for this Station. Septic tanks and possible 
direct disposal constitute the potential contamination sources. Runoffs from 
agricultural land and other contaminant transport through a drainage channel are 
possible hazards at station nine (9) and eleven (11).
 
4.	Research methods:
 	The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring began on December 20, 1995 at 
Station nine (9), February 1, 1996 at Station ten (10), March 15, 1996 at 
Station eleven (11), and at Station six (6) on December 06, 1996. At this time 
we are only performing long term water quality monitoring.
	Before each YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and maintenance 
is performed following the manufacturer's instruction (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, 
sections 3,4 and 7). Calibration standards are only required for pH, salinity, 
and turbidity, all other parameters are done as described in the manual. Buffer 
solutions for two-point calibration (pH 7 and pH 10) are purchased from a 
scientific supply house. Salinity is calibrated via a specific conductance 
standard 1000 µs/cm and are purchased from a scientific supply house.  This 
solution is also prepared in the laboratory of Department of Natural and 
Environmental Resources (DNER) utilizing KCl following specification of EPA 
methods.
	The two-point turbidity calibration (as of January 01, 1997) was performed 
using a 0 NTU standard using lab grade DI water made at the DNER laboratory and 
40 NTU standard purchased from a scientific supply house. We are now using 
(since Jan 01, 1997) a 200 NTU standard purchased from a scientific company. The 
dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit 
at least 24 hours prior to deployment.
	The weather conditions and tide stage during deployment are recorded in 
the field observation log. Measurements of DO, pH, salinity, specific 
conductance, temperature, turbidity (secchi) are taken with other calibrated 
field instruments to check the accuracy of the instrumentation.
	Each YSI datalogger is tied with steel cable to a wrought iron galvanized 
pole, which is plunged into the sediments of each sampling area.  Dataloggers 
are deployed at a depth of 0.3 m. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 
measurements are taken for date, time, temperature, specific conductance, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, 
pH, and turbidity. Every two weeks the dataloggers are retrieved, uploaded, 
cleaned, inspected, and calibrated as noted previously. The datalogger is then 
ready to be deployed.

5. Site location and character:
 	The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JOBNERR) is located on 
the southern coastal plain of the island of Puerto Rico, a reserve within the 
West Indies geographical area. JOBNERR is composed of two major areas: (1) Mar 
Negro, located on the western margin of the Bay, and (2) Cayos Caribe, a chain 
of 15 tear-shaped islets located to the southeast. The Mar Negro area comprises 
the bulk of the Reserve, and consists of mangrove forests and a complex system 
of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats.  Coral reefs and 
seagrass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas fringe Cayos Caribe 
mangrove islands.
 	Station 6 is located in the bay close to the peninsular drape area in Mar 
Negro knows as Punta Colchones.  The datalogger is deployed at about five meters 
from the emergence of the fallout pipe cooling water from the Thermoelectric 
Power Plant. This station is subject to high temperatures and sediment 
resuspension.  The tidal range varies from 12 in. to 14 in. in the vicinity of 
the monitoring station.  No fresh water input in the vicinity of the station is 
probable.  The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 
34.0 ppt to 35.7 ppt.  The station pole is located at 17° 56’ 6.5"N and 66° 13’ 
43.6"W.
	Station 9 is an impacted site and is located at the northeastern part of 
the Mar Negro unit. The sampling station is associated with the mangrove lagoon 
area and received the Thermoelectric Power Plant runoff through mudflats and 
areas adjacent. The tidal range varies from 12 in. to 14 in. in the vicinity of 
the monitoring station.  No fresh water input in the vicinity of the station is 
probable. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 0.0 
ppt to 41.1 ppt.  The station pole is located at 17° 56' 36.8" N and 66° 14' 
18.5" W.
 	Station 10 is located in a mangrove lagoon not impacted from upland or 
marine activities. It provided a reference for comparison of the data obtained 
in other stations, especially to the stations in Mar Negro lagoon environment.  
The tidal range varies from 12 in. to 14 in. in the vicinity of the monitoring 
station.  No fresh water input in the vicinity of the station is probable. The 
salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 0.0 ppt to 41.7 
ppt.  The pole is located at 17° 56' 20.3" N and 66° 45' 26.7" W.
 	Station 11 datalogger is tied to a small pier stand in the westernmost 
lagoon in the Mar Negro unit. Although a chain from a small pier suspends this 
datalogger, and it has been deployed at the same depth of the other dataloggers. 
Non point sources of contaminants from residences and boating activities in the 
vicinity are probable. The lagoon is characterized by dark bottom, tidal range 
from 12 in. to 14 in., allegedly related to long term deposition of organic 
wastes from the sugar mill operation when the mill was operating. No fresh water 
input in the vicinity of the station is probable. The salinity at the vicinity 
of the monitoring station varies from 0.0 ppt to 36.7 ppt.  The datalogger is 
suspended by a chain and localized at 17° 56' 41.8" N and 66° 15' 46.0" W. 
	All monitoring is considered long term.
 
6. Data collection period: 
 	Station nine (9) sampling with the YSI began on December 20, 1995.
	Station ten (10) sampling with the YSI began on February 1, 1996.
	Station eleven (11) sampling with the YSI began on March 15, 1996.
	Station six (6) sampling with the YSI began on December 06, 1996.
 
7. Associated researchers and projects:
	A water quality and plankton monitoring scheme was initiated in 1995, to 
monitor 12 stations in the Jobos Bay system. This effort, conducted by the 
Department of Natural and Environmental Resources Laboratory began in March 
1995, using a Hydrolab Data sonde 3 with a Surveyor 3 readout system, monitoring 
the water column on a bimonthly time basis for abiotic parameter similar to the 
YSI. Monthly samples for nutrients, plankton and chlorophyll were conducted from 
March to October (Water Quality Monitoring-Spatial and temporal variations of 
main abiotic and plankton components in JOBNERR, 1996). Samplings were resumed 
in January 1996 and will be conducted until March 1997).
