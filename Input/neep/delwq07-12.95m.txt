2.  Entry Verification:
The data is directly downloaded in a spreadsheet format from the YSI 6000 UPG datalogger to a PC.  Edited files 
are created by removing headers, footers, and spaces on a PC.  Missing data from YSI 6000 maintenance (downtime) 
is inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.) as well as any data anomalies.  Data and graphs are 
visually inspected to find possible anomalies. An Excel Software macro is used to find variable outliers in the data 
set.  Edited and raw files are currently stored on DCMP local area network Hard Drive and on 3.5 inch floppy 
diskettes.   Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged monthly files are also 
transferred to NERRs Central Data Management Office.

3.  Experimental Design:
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over two week periods at one site in each component river of Delaware's 
National Estuarine Research Reserve (St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek).  The St. Jones River is impacted by 
urbanization upstream and extensive agricultural activity throughout the basin.  The Blackbird Creek is one of the 
least impacted riverine systems in Delaware.

4.  Research Methods:
The YSI 6000 datalogger monitoring program was started in July 1995 at Scotton Landing (St. Jones River) and 
Blackbird Landing (Blackbird Creek).  Prior to deployment, a 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC pipe was mounted to a 
piling at Scotton Landing and a bridge at Blackbird Landing using stainless steel brackets and bolts.  Each YSI 6000 
is lowered into the PVC pipe which has eight (8) two inch diameter holes cut out at the bottom for the probes to have 
direct contact with the water column.  A large stainless steel bolt was placed at the bottom end of the PVC pipe 
which maintained each YSI 6000 at each site exactly one foot (30 cm) above the river bottom.  Every half hour over 
a two week period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature, pH, and water level are recorded.  Seven days after the deployment of each YSI 6000, the dissolved 
oxygen membrane is cleaned with a Kimwipe dipped in methanol.  Two week sampling intervals were selected due 
to limitations created by the dissolved oxygen membrane.  At the end of each two week period, the YSI 6000 is 
brought back to the office for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration.  These procedures are carried out according 
to the methods as described in the YSI Model 6000 Operating and Service Manual.  After approximately six hours of 
down time for cleaning and recalibration, the YSI 6000's are redeployed for another two week period.

5.  Site location and character:
The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component sites, the St. Jones River and 
Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are located along the Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones  River 
Component is located in central Kent County Delaware, east of the State Capitol City, Dover.  The Blackbird Creek 
component is located in the unincorporated area  of Southern New Castle County.  There are two sampling sites, one 
located in each DNERR component.
1) Scotton Landing - is located in the Lower St. Jones River at the Scotton Landing Public Fishing Pier, just up 
stream of Delaware Route 113.  The site is influenced by freshwater runoff from the relatively urbanized area 
upstream.  Salinity ranges from 8 - 30 ppt.
             Position:  Latitude     39 degree 05'  05.9160"  N
                             Longitude  75 degree 27'  38.1049"  W
2) Blackbird Landing - is located in the upper Blackbird Creek at Blackbird Landing Road.  The site is influenced by 
freshwater runoff from unimpacted forested areas intermixed with agricultural land uses and a small amount of low 
density development.  Salinity ranges from 2-7 ppt.
            Position:  Latitude      39 degree 23'  19.5196"  N
                            Longitude   75 degree 38'  09.5882"  W

6.  Data collection period:
Scotton Landing data collection began on July 1, 1995.  Blackbird Landing data collection began on July 14, 1995.  
All sampling is ongoing.  No Turbidity reading for 1995 in either of the two sites.

7.  Associated researchers and projects: 
An extensive stormwater sampling and hydrodynamic modeling project is underway in the upper reaches of the St. 
Jones River Basin.  This project includes flow weighted stormwater sampling to quantify pollutant loads from each 
of the major landuses found in the Basin.
A joint effort underway through NOAA's Coastal Service Center and the DNERR characterization studies will 
initiate detailed monthly water quality sampling at three sites in each river over a two year period and will quantify 
the phytoplankton community with collections from the same sites.

10. Data anomalies (suspect data):

July, 1995: 
SL: DO probe was believed to be reading higher than actual DO levels during its July 13-27,1995 deployment. Time 
(seconds) change from :00 to :45 on July 14 09:30 to July 31 23:30.
BL: DO membrane is suspected of possible minor fouling between 7/25 and 7/26 due to sediment and algae build-up 
on membrane surface. 

August, 1995: 
BL:  Time (seconds) change from :00 to :45 on August 15 13:30 to August 29 10:30.

September, 1995: 
BL:  The salinity value from 9/26 through 9/30, 1995 were off due to calibration error. Therefore those readings 
were deleted out and replaced by (.).

October, 1995: 
BL:  The salinity value from 10/01 through 10/10, 1995 were off due to calibration error. 	Therefore those readings 
were deleted out and replaced by (.).  Time (minutes & seconds) change from 00:00 to 01:54 on October 24 15:00 to 
October 31 23:30.

November, 1995: None to report

December, 1995:  None to report
