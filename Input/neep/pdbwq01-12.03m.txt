2) Entry verification:

The data are downloaded from the YSI 6600 sondes to a Windows based PC. Graphs 
of all data are printed using EcoWatch software and are examined for suspect, 
anomalous, or outlying data.  The files are then exported as .csv files and the 
CDMO macros are used for final formatting and a second check for outliers and 
missing data. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro allows the user to automatically 
format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each datalogger generated file 
for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro allows PC 
users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a 
two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  It also has a graphing 
capability that allows users to produce single parameter and missing data point 
graphs on a monthly basis. After formatting the data, some files are more 
closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro®. Edited and raw files are 
archived on a PC hard drive and on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR. 
Periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Robin 
Cottrell completed this process of entry verification for the 2003 data. 
Robin Cottrell and Douglas Bulthuis completed final verification and this 
metadata documentation.

3) Research objectives:

The Bay View Channel site has been set out to detect and monitor short-term 
variability and long-term changes in the southern part of Padilla Bay. The Ploeg 
Channel site has been set out to detect and monitor short-term variability and 
long-term change in the northern part of Padilla Bay for comparison and contrast 
with water quality in the southern part of the bay. The Joe Leary Slough site 
has been set at the mouth of the slough to measure the effects of tidal 
"closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough and to detect long-term 
changes in water quality in the slough associated with an implementation of a 
non point source pollution watershed action plan. The Gong site has been set in 
the deep water strait east of the northern part of Padilla Bay to monitor short-
term variability and long-term change in the waters that are a source for the 
tidal waters flowing into Padilla Bay. Both surface (1.5 m below the surface) 
and bottom waters (2.0 m above the bottom, about 20 m deep) are being monitored 
to detect any vertical differences. The four sites are set up to provide an 
indication of the salinity gradient from Joe Leary Slough (freshwater) through 
Bayview Channel (downstream of freshwater sources from Indian and No Name 
Sloughs) to Ploeg Channel (remote from freshwater sources but in a tidal 
channel) to Gong on the marine end of the gradient. Measurements are taken every 
30 minutes at all sites unless otherwise noted in data anomalies. 

4) Research methods:

YSI 6600 sondes were deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical position, 1.7 m 
from the bottom of the slough in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe with a metal bar 
secured at the bottom as a stop. That portion of pipe around the sensors is cut 
out so that only two one-inch wide strips of deployment pipe remain around the 
sensor guard to allow water circulation around the probes. The PVC pipe is 
attached to a steel pipe that was driven into the sediment. (This slough was 
dredged in the fall of 2000 so the area of deployment is much deeper than it had 
been the previous 5 years. To keep the data comparable the YSI is deployed at 
the same height relative to Mean Sea Level.) 
 
YSI 6600 sondes were deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview Channel. 
They were deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, except 
that the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes. To keep marine fauna from 
interfering with operation of the sensors "Gutter Guard" (a sheet of plastic ¼ ? 
mesh) is formed into a cylinder to fit inside the sensor guard. The depth of the 
YSI was –1.1 m (depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the 
sloping edge of a small channel draining the surrounding intertidal flats.

YSI 6600 sondes were deployed in Ploeg Channel using the same design as that in 
Bayview Channel including the use of mesh to protect the sensors. The depth of 
the datalogger was 0.5 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a channel 
draining the surrounding intertidal flats.

Two YSI 6600 sondes were deployed at Gong site at two depths suspended from a 
single buoy: 1.5 m below the surface and 2.0 m above the bottom in 18-20 m water 
depth (only the surface site data is reported to CDMO). The dataloggers were 
secured to the line with YSI mooring clamps. The deep datalogger was deployed at 
about –18 m (depth below MLLW) on a gradual slope that is intertidal on the 
Padilla Bay side and goes down to about 75 m near the Guemes Island side of the 
strait. A subsurface buoy was attached to it to keep the sensors above the 
sediment surface during tidal fluctuations.

In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, 
percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth, pH and turbidity are recorded 
every half hour. At the end of each deployment, the YSI 6600 is brought back 
into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Before final 
cleaning and recalibration a post-deployment check is done that consists of 
recording sensor readings in the standard solutions. The results of these checks 
are used to help evaluate the validity of the logged data.

All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 
Environmental Operations Manual for the 6-Series Environmental Monitoring 
Systems. For the conductivity calibration a conductivity standard of 50 mS/cm 
was used. The pH calibration is a 2-point calibration using standard buffer 
solutions with a pH of 7 and 10. The KCl solution and Teflon membrane on the 
dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6600 deployment and the new 
oxygen membrane is allowed to stabilize overnight in water saturated air before 
calibration. A 2-point calibration is used for the turbidity probe and the 
wiper pad is changed prior to each deployment. The standards used are 
distilled/deionized water for zero and 4000 NTU Formazin solution diluted to 100 
NTU.

5) Site location and character:

General: Padilla Bay (48º 30' N; 122º 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern 
Puget Sound. The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera marina, which 
covers approximately 3,000 ha. Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, 
now covers about 350 ha of the bay. Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with a mean 
range of 1.55 m. Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU. 

Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer empties 
directly into it. Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed is 
agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay. The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located. Major 
freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary come 
from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River to 
the south.

Joe Leary Slough Site: (48º 31' 05.3" N; 122º 28' 22.8" W) Joe Leary Slough 
drains land that is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture land with 
some low-density housing. The slough is characterized by high fecal and nutrient 
inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. During the 
summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m. During winter 
flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m. There is a dam at the mouth of 
the slough with twelve 4 ft. diameter outfall pipes that have one-way 
hinged tide gates. Upstream water flows out of Joe Leary Slough when water 
height in Padilla Bay is lower than water height in Joe Leary Slough (i.e. 
ebbing tide and low water). Some saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through the 
tide gates during high water. The bottom of the slough is composed of very soft 
sediment, which is periodically dredged, most recently October 2000. The 
deployment site is on the freshwater side of the tide gates. The 
latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and 
differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated 
accuracy of ± 5 m.

Bayview Channel Site: (48º 29' 46.6" N; 122º 30' 01.8" W) Bayview Channel, a 
major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macro-vegetation. 
The datalogger is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel. The 
tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z.Japonica) covered 
intertidal flats. Bottom sediments beneath the deployment site are fine silt and 
clay overlying sand. Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point 
source, agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from 
agriculture, failing septic tanks and wildlife. The latitude/longitude were 
measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and differentially corrected with post 
processing providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 5 m.

Ploeg Channel Site: (48º 33' 23.5" N; 122º 31' 46.7" W) Ploeg Channel floods and 
drains intertidal flats at the north end of Padilla Bay that are comprised of 
mud flats and eelgrass beds (Zostera marina and Z.Japonica) in approximately 
equal amounts. Bottom sediments beneath the deployment site are fine silt. Depth 
at this site is –1.54 m (depth below MLLW). Pollutants entering the bay include 
general non-point source, agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliform 
bacteria from agriculture, failing septic tanks and wildlife. The 
latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and 
differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated 
accuracy of ± 5 m.

Gong Site: (48º 33' 30" N; 122º 34' 21" W) The Gong site is located at –18 m on 
a gradually sloping bottom (from –1 m to –75 m over 2 Km) in the strait between 
Samish and Guemes Islands. Water in the strait flows north and south with tidal 
currents, the net water movement is apparently south toward the inlet to Guemes 
Channel. Water from the strait flows onto the intertidal flats in the northern 
part of Padilla Bay with each tidal cycle. Bottom sediments are mud. The only 
apparent pollution sources are the general sources of pollution to the Strait of 
Georgia and Northwest Straits. The latitude/longitude were measured with a 
Trimble GeoExplorer II and differentially corrected with post processing 
providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 5 m.

6) Data collection period: Data collection was continuous from January 1 to 
December 31 at Joe Leary Slough, Bayview Channel and Ploeg Channel sites. Gong 
site was first installed in March 2003; data collection at this site was 
continuous from March 28 to December 31 (only the surface site data is reported 
to CDMO).

Deployment and retrieval times are listed below. The times indicate the first 
and last measurements made with each deployment. (Deployments using the new 
6600EDS [Extended Deployment System] sonde are noted with "EDS".)

Bayview Channel
During the following periods turbidity data were deleted because they were high 
and erratic, cause unknown:	
01/11/2003	11:00:00
01/12/2003	12:30:00

The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 01/01/03 at 
00:00:00 through 01/21/03 at 11:00:00 was low, 46.0 in a solution of 50.0 mS/cm. 
This could be due to fouling in the probe orifice or the calibration solution 
used for the post calibration check was at fault. Salinity values during this 
period may be lower than actual values.

During the following periods pH data were deleted because the slope of the 
sensor as indicated by the millivolt readings during calibration were out of the 
acceptable range:
01/01/03	00:00:00 to 01/21/03	11:00:00

The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 01/21/03 at 
12:00:00 to 01/31/03 at 23:30:00 was high, 50.86 mS/cm in a solution of 50.0 
mS/cm. The probe may have been calibrated in a contaminated calibration 
solution. Salinity values during this deployment may be slightly higher than 
actual values.

The post-calibration salinity value for two deployment periods was high. The 
first period was 01/13/03 at 15:00:00 to 01/23/03 at 14:30:00 and the value was 
50.76 mS/cm, the second period was 01/23/03 at 15:00:00 to 01/31/03 at 23:30:00 
and that value was 50.68 mS/cm, both in a solution of 50.00. The probes may have 
been calibrated in a contaminated calibration solution. Salinity values during 
these deployments may be slightly higher than actual values.

Joe Leary
The post-calibration turbidity value was low for the deployment period of 
02/05/03 at 14:00:00 to 02/19/03 at 13:00:00, 81.9 NTU in 100 NTU solution, 
which is outside the specified accuracy for this probe. This was a new model 
(#6136) turbidity probe and YSI eventually recalled them to replace the motor 
and lubricant. Turbidity values during the deployment of this probe may be lower 
than actual values. 

On 02/16 at 01:00:00 there was a small negative depth reading of -.006 m. There 
is no evidence from the other sensors that the datalogger was out of the water. 
This value is within the range of accuracy expected from the non-vented pressure 
sensor reacting to a change in atmospheric pressure.

During the following period pH values may be higher than actual values. The 
solution used to calibrate this probe was bad, the post-cal reading in the 
standard of 7 was 7.57.

(This is the first month with data from the new Gong site.)

For the deployment period of 03/28/03 at 13:30:00 to 03/31/03 at 23:30:00:
The turbidity probe post-calibration value of 87.6 in a solution of 100.0 NTU 
indicates a possible problem with the probe. It was returned for repair in June 
so turbidity data from this deployment should be interpreted with caution.
The post-calibration salinity value was high, 50.62 in a solution of 50.0 mS/cm. 
The probe may have been calibrated in a contaminated calibration solution. 
Salinity values during this deployment may be slightly higher than actual 
values. The post-calibration dissolved oxygen value was low, 92.6%, cause 
unknown. D. O. values may be lower than actual values.

April 1 – 30, 2003

values:
04/11/03	09:00:00 to 04/24/03	10:00:00
(Since both Bayview and Ploeg instruments were calibrated on the same day the 
turbidity standard used was probably at fault, see Ploeg Channel below.)

During the post-calibration check for the deployment from 04/18/03 at 12:30:00 
to 04/30/03 at 23:30:00 the wiper on the turbidity sensor was not parking 
properly, it may be interference from the wiper that caused the high turbidity 
values during the last part of this time period. All turbidity values during 
this deployment period should be interpreted with caution.

For the deployment period of 04/01/03 at 002:00:00 to 04/09/03 at 11:00:00: 
The turbidity probe post-calibration value of 87.6 in a solution of 100.0 NTU 
indicates a possible problem with the probe. It was returned for repair in June 
so turbidity data from this deployment should be interpreted with caution.
The post-calibration salinity value was high, 50.62 in a solution of 50.0 mS/cm. 
The probe may have been calibrated in a contaminated calibration solution. 
Salinity values during this deployment may be slightly higher than actual

Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from 04/24/03 at 10:00:00 to 04/30/03 at 
23:30:00 because the sensor membrane was damaged prior to deployment.

Turbidity values for the period of 04/24/03 at 10:00:00 to 04/30/03 at 23:30:00 
change rapidly over the course of the deployment. The scale looks reasonable but 
the rapid fluctuations are inconsistent with the other turbidity data for the 
year at this site. There was no indication of a problem with the turbidity probe 
but this data should be interpreted with caution

05/12/03	07:30:00, 08:30:00, 09:30:00, 19:30:00

Other high readings during this time correspond with low depth levels so they 
are occurring when the tide gates are open and water is flowing out of the 
slough. The cause of the high readings is unknown.

Gong Surface
Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from 05/01/03 at 00:00:00 to 05/08/03 at

All pH data were removed for the deployment period from 06/13/03 at 13:30:00 to 
06/27/03 at 13:30:00 due to probe failure.

The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 06/27 at 
14:00:00 through 06/30 at 23:30:00 was low, 49.19 in a solution of 50.0 mS/cm. 
This could be due to fouling in the probe orifice or the calibration solution 
used for the post calibration check was at fault. Salinity values during this

During the following period turbidity data were deleted because it was high and 
erratic, cause unknown:
09/08/03	12:00:00

From 09/06/03 at 08:30:00 to 09/09/03 at 16:30:00 there were intermittent small 
negative depth readings. There is no evidence from the other sensors that the 
datalogger was out of the water. These values are within the range of accuracy 
expected from the non-vented pressure sensor reacting to a change in atmospheric 
pressure.

Erratic depth readings on 09/01/03 correspond to windy conditions recorded at 
the Padilla Bay weather station.

The post-calibration dissolved oxygen value for the deployment period of 
09/01/03 at 00:00:00 to 09/05/03 at 13:00:00 was low, 91.4%. This may have been 
caused by biofouling so this data should be interpreted with caution 
particularly toward the end of the deployment period.

On 09/16/03 from 12:00:00 to 16:0:00 there are anomalous depth readings that are 
also present, to a greater extent, on an instrument deployed at a deeper depth 
on the same line. This indicates that debris may have been caught on the line 
pulling both instruments out of position. Readings on the other sensors remained 
stable.

October 1 – 31, 2003
A major flood occurred on the Skagit River this month caused by heavy rainfall 
in the mountains. The crest reached the flood gauge in Mount Vernon on 10/21/03 
at about 20:00. Rain events and floodwaters influenced salinity values at the 
Ploeg, Bayview and Gong sites.

On 10/04/03 at 08:30:00 and on 10/29/03 from 02:30:00 to 05:00:00 there were 
small negative and/or zero depth readings. There is no evidence from the other 
sensors that the datalogger was out of the water. These values are within the

Gong Surface
The post-calibration turbidity value for the deployment period of 10/02/03 at 
13:00:00 to 10/15/03 at 09:00:00 was very low, 69.5 in a solution of 100.0 NTU, 
and the data recorded during this period was uncharacteristically erratic for 
this site so all of the turbidity data during this deployment was deleted. It 
appeared to be a probe failure but there were no problems with this probe on 
subsequent deployments so the cause is unknown.

The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 10/29/03 at 
10:00:00 to 10/31/03 at 23:30:00 was high, 50.61 in a standard of 50.00 mS/cm.

November 1 – 30, 2003
(Elevated turbidities at Ploeg, Bayview and Joe Leary sites on Nov. 10,16-18 and 
28 correspond to storm events with strong winds and heavy rain.)

During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
11/20/03	03:30:00

Small negative depth readings as low as –0.23m that occurred intermittently from 
11/24/03 through 11/27/03 on the low tides is probably a result of the non-
vented depth sensor being calibrated during a high pressure event of 30.45 
in/Hg, and most of these readings occurring at or below 29.7 in/Hg. Salinity 
values indicate the sensors were submerged during the entire deployment.

The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 11/01/03 at 
00:00:00 to 10/12/03 at 13:30:00 was high, 50.50 in a standard of 50.00 mS/cm.

High salinity on 11/20/03 and 11/25/03 indicates the tide gates were leaking 
marine water into the fresh water side when the gates should have been closed. 
This can happen when debris gets caught in one or more of the tide gates. 

Gong Surface
The post-calibration salinity value for the deployment period of 11/01/03 at

Bayview Channel
Small negative depth readings as low as –0.18m that occur intermittently from 
12/22/03 through 12/24/03 on the low tides is probably a result of the non-
vented depth sensor being calibrated during a high pressure event of 30.45 
in/Hg, and these readings occurring at pressures ranging from 29.9 to 29.3 
in/Hg. Salinity values indicate the sensors were submerged during the entire 
deployment.

Joe Leary
During the first week of December there was dirt work, brush cutting and rock 
added to the dike where the tide gates are installed. This may have contributed 
to some elevated turbidities from 12/01/03 through 12/05/03

12) Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14) Other Remarks/notes
Generally high turbidities in Joe Leary Slough correspond to heavy rain events 
as on November 18 when 38.4 mm of precipitation was recorded at our weather 
station. At the two bay sites, Bayview Channel and Ploeg Channel, wind is often 
the driving force affecting turbidity as occurred during the period of March 12 
to14 when both sites had elevated turbidities and average wind speed for those 
days ranged from 7.1 to 8.9 m/s with a maximum gust of 24.0 m/s on March 12.
Periodic low salinity values in the 20 to 25 ppt range at Gong Surface during 
the summer months may be the result of high river flows (the Fraser and Nooksack 
Rivers to the north and the Skagit River to the south) due to melt water from 
snow fields and glaciers in the Cascade Range.
