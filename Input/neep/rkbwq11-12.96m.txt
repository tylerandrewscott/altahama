2. Entry verification.
	The data contained herein were directly downloaded from the YSI 6000 data sonde to 
the PC6000 software on a DOS-based 486 computer.  The data were immediately exported to 
Excel on a Macintosh PowerPC.  Charting and plotting routines within Excel and within 
Kaleidograph were used to verify the accuracy of the data.  In addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros 
provided by the CDMO were used to format and check the dataset for outliers beyond what 
the probes measure.  Outliers and erroneous data were also checked manually using the 
protocol defined in Appendix B of CDMO Operations Manual (v. 3.0).  The data was then 
sent via US postal system on disk to the CDMO.  

Note:  This dataset was prepared by Dr. Michael Savarese who is currently an associate 
professor at Florida Gulf Coast University.  All inquires concerning the dataset should be 
addressed to the principal investigator or contact(see above) at Rookery Bay NERR.

3. Research objectives.
	Henderson Creek, the area in which both our data sondes are deployed, is the 
Reserve¹s principal water conduit feeding the estuary and the Gulf of Mexico.  Henderson¹s 
watershed is almost entirely under public ownership, though historically much of its acreage 
was privately owned and developed.  Consequently, the Henderson system represents a 
restored watershed and estuary and serves as a management model for southwestern Florida.  
For this reason, the Reserve is interested in long-term monitoring of its water quality.  In 
addition, we have begun a new research initiative which concerns the coastal linkages of 
processes and effects between estuaries and nearshore marine settings (just offshore in the 
Gulf of Mexico).  These two research purposes have dictated the placement of the two YSI 
data sondes.  The first sonde, which has been in place since early November, 1996 (metadata 
reported herein), is located high within the estuary where salinities fluctuate drastically 
through tidal cycles and through seasonal changes in climate.  The second sonde will be 
deployed in mid-January, 1997.  It will be located far downstream within the estuary, at the 
estuary¹s mouth to the Gulf (Big Marco Pass).  Data from this second sonde will be 
transferred after January, 1997.

4. Research methods.
	The first YSI sonde deployment began on November 7, 1996 in the upper portion of 
Henderson Creek(see site location and character).   The sonde is housed within a 4-inch 
diameter PVC pipe which is attached to an ìaid-to-navigation¹ piling.  The pipe is oriented 
vertically, huging the piling, and is attached with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom 
portion of the pipe is open and sits 6 inches above the bottom.  Probe tips are therefore 
taking measurements approximately 6-8 inches above the substrate.  Numerous 1-inch 
diameter holes are drilled circumferentially around the lower 8 inches of the pipe to ensure 
adequate water flow around the probes.  Sondes are hung by galvanized steel chain inside the 
pipe; the chain is bolted to the piling.  A ëkryptonite¹ bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde 
inside the housing.
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific conductivity, turbidity 
and dissolved oxygen following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating and Service 
Manual.  A two point calibration is used for pH(Fisher buffers 7& 10) and turbidity(0 & 40 
NTU from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution is prepared to calibrate 
specific conductivity while dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % saturation.  Sondes are 
deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 weeks time the fouling on the probes 
becomes critical.  Sampling period is set for 30-minute intervals (readings are made every 30 
minutes on the half hour).  The following physical water quality parameters are recorded:  
temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen(mg/l), dissolved oxygen(% 
saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A post-deployment calibration is done after the sonde is 
taken out of the water using the same calibration protocol.  

5. Site location & character.
	RKB¹s monitoring sites (monitoring at the second site will begin in January, 1997) 
are 
located at the up- and downstream ends of Henderson Creek, the principal estuarine system 
within the Reserve.
	The Upper Henderson site is located on the upper region of Henderson Creek.  The 
piling is located right of center (while facing downstream) of the creek channel, 
approximately 50 meters downstream of State Hwy 951¹s crossing of Henderson Creek.
	UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone 17, datum NAD-27):
		E429855.23
		N2881137.96
	Lat/Long:	
		26deg 02¹ 56.46587¹ N
		81deg 42¹  4.21595¹ W
	This segment of Henderson Creek is bordered by red mangrove forest.  A residential 
area, consisting of trailer parks, is located immediately upstream.  These may be delivering 
point-source pollutants.
	The substrate within the channel is composed of organic-rich, black mud.  The water 
depth varies between 0.5 and 1.5 meters, depending on the state of the tide.  Salinities 
fluctuate daily with the tides and seasonally with rainfall.  For the months of November and 
December, 1996, salinities varied between 15 - 32 ppt.

6. Data collection period.
	5 sonde deployments occurred throughout Nov. & Dec., 1996 at Upper Henderson 
Creek.

7. Associated researchers & projects.
	Dr. Mike Shirley (at RKB) has a telemetered YSI monitoring station recording the 
same physical water quality parameters (minus turbidity) at a site downstream from the 
Upper Henderson Creek site.  These data are also available upon request.

10. Data anomalies.

November 7 - 30, 1996 Sampling Period
	(a) On 11/22 at 0630 hours the turbidity spiked at -500.3 NTU.
	(b) From time to time throughout the record for November turbidity values become 
slightly negative (not dropping below -3.0 NTU).  These values, however, follow the 
temporal trends seen when turbidity is plotted against time and they are correlated against 
tidal fluctuations -- the turbidity values are predictably negative and follow logically from the 
values that immediately precede and follow them.  Consequently, these data were not deleted 
from the Excel file.  The dates and times are listed here:
		11/23		0730 - 0800
		11/24		0730 - 0800
		11/26		0700 - 1000, 1100
		11/27		0630, 0730 - 1130, 1230
		11/28		0700, 0800 - 1300
		11/29		0930 - 1230
		11/30		1030 - 1300

December 1 - 31, 1996 Sampling Period
	(a) Three problems occurred in the dissolved oxygen record:
		1. On 12/25 at 0030 hours a spike appeared (285.3% & 21.26 mg/L).  The 
record before and after this time point looks normal and consistent.
		2. On 12/31 from 0500 - 0600 hours the oxygen values spiked at ~275%.  
These values are inconsistent with those values immediately preceding and following them.
		3. On 12/31 from 1630 - 2330 hours the % dissolved oxygen values became 
inconsistent and unreliable, at times exceeding 240%.  These values have been deleted from 
the record (see Missing Data).  The anomalous values continued into January (not reported 
herein) through the sonde¹s retrieval on 1/6/97.  These will be discarded when January¹s data 
are reported.  Upon retrieval of the sonde on the 6th, the oxygen membrane was intensely 
fouled and scratched.
	(b) From time to time throughout the record for December turbidity values become 
slightly negative (not dropping below -3.0 NTU).  These values, however, follow the 
temporal trends seen when turbidity is plotted against time and they are correlated against 
tidal fluctuations -- the turbidity values are predictably negative and follow logically from the 
values that immediately precede and follow them.  Consequently, these data were not deleted 
from the Excel file.  The dates and times are listed here:
		12/1		1100 - 1230
		12/2		1230 - 1400
		12/3		1130, 1400 - 1500
		12/4		0300 - 0330
		12/5		0230, 0400
		12/6		0230, 0330 - 0630, 1600, 1800
		12/7		0330 - 0630, 0730
		12/8		0230, 0330 - 0800, 1830 - 1900, 2000
		12/9		0400 - 0730, 0830 - 1130, 1230

11. Missing data.

November 7 - 30, 1996 Sampling Period
	(a) The record for November begins on 11/7/96 at 1200 hours.  This was the first 
deployment at the Upper Henderson location, so no data were collected prior to this time..
	(b) For the time interval: 11/14 at 1600 to 11/25 at 1400, salinity was not recorded.  
The salinity option was inadvertently switched off.  Specific conductivity was recorded, 
however.

December 1 - 31, 1996 Sampling Period
(a) No data were recorded on 12/23 at 1430 hours.  The sonde swap was miss timed, leaving a 
30-minute gap in the record.
(b) Dissolved oxygen data (%dO & dO mg/L) on 12/31 from 1630 - 2330 hours were deleted 
because of a damaged oxygen probe membrane.
