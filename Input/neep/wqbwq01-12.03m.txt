2)	Entry verification:

		The data are uploaded in three file formats (each to separate files 
identified with the same file name but with unique extensions) from the YSI 6000 
and 6600 data loggers to a PC with the YSI 6000 and 6600 EcoWatch software.  Two 
of these (PC6000 and ASCII text formats) are kept on file in the WBNERR archive.  
The comma delimited format data file (.csv) is imported to the EXCEL spreadsheet 
program (version 5.0) where it is processed according to standard NERRS CDMO 
protocol using the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros.  File size of one complete month 
of data each has been achieved by concatenating (and truncating if necessary) 
shorter files of interrupted data segments.  File contents initially are 
examined for anomalies (e.g., sensor malfunction, battery failure, spurious 
values, etc.) by visualization of data with the Ecowatch Software provided by 
YSI.  The data are also graphed using the Excel program for each two-week 
deployment of raw data. Data requiring editing are noted and copies of the 
graphs of raw data are saved at WBNERR.  Data editing to CDMO protocol is 
conducted in Excel.  Missing data (data logger malfunction or maintenance 
periods) are represented by periods (".").  Outliers (data values not within the 
design range of the respective sensors except for turbidity and depth) 
are changed to periods.  Data values recorded during deployment or retrieval 
(i.e., when the instrument was out of the water or in the laboratory) are 
deleted or replaced with periods.  Upon data review by the CDMO, all periods were 
later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. A record of changes 
is documented in the Data Anomalies section of the metadata file. The monthly files 
are sent electronically by FTP to CDMO.  
		The CDMO cdmomac3.xls will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file 
from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.  
Copies of all files are retained at the Reserve.  During Deployment Year 2003, 
the Research Assistant, Kelly Chapman, performed all instrument calibration and 
maintenance and data management.


3)	Research objectives:

		For the NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), the YSI data 
loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 minutes. A 
total of four SWMP sites were located in the Waquoit Bay estuarine system during 
2003. These four are: 1) Metoxit Point (MP), which is the oldest actively 
monitored site (since 1998), is located in the middle of Waquoit Bay's main 
basin; 2) Menauhant (MH), in operation since March 2001, is located adjacent to 
Eel Pond Inlet on Vineyard Sound – one of the two tidal inlets into the Waquoit 
Bay estuary; 3) Child's River (CR), in operation since May 2002, located near 
the head of the tidal section of Child's River— one of the two main surface 
fresh water sources to Waquoit Bay; and 4) Sage Lot (SL), in operation since May 
2002, located in Sage Lot Pond—a relatively pristine tidal pond surrounded by 
salt marsh and barrier beach, possessing one of the bay's few remaining eelgrass 
stands.  
		The main purpose of water quality monitoring program is to aid 
Waquoit Bay NERR in one of its priority missions - to perform as a natural  
laboratory and platform for coastal and estuarine research. The long term, 
continuous detailed monitoring of the estuary's basic hydrophysical parameters 
is an essential tool and context for any research activities located here. 
Besides this overarching mission, there are also several specific research 
interests.  One primary issue for the Waquoit Bay ecosystem is the influence of 
anthropogenic induced alterations by nitrogen enrichment.  Waquoit Bay receives 
nitrogen from several sources, such as septic systems (their leachate percolates 
into groundwater which then enters the bay), run off from roads, run off 
containing domestic and agricultural fertilizer and animal waste, and 
atmospheric sources. This elevated nitrogen loading to the bay has resulted in 
enhanced eutrophication that has contributed to the alteration of the bay's 
habitats.  For example, thick mats of seaweeds (macroaglae) now cover the bottom 
where eelgrass meadows thrived in the 1970's.  Unfortunately, there are few 
definitive records of the bay's water quality conditions during that period, 
which makes it difficult to evaluate the rates of change.  To facilitate future 
evaluation, long-term records from SWMP can be used to track water column 
conditions.  Of particular interest, in this regard are measurements of 
dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, dissolved nitrogen and chlorophyll 
concentration.  Such records will facilitate evaluation of changes which may 
come about from a continuation of watershed alteration that result from 
current development patterns  (i.e., non-sewered residential areas served by 
private septic systems typically consisting of septic tanks and leach fields) as 
well as non-industrial commercial development, such as golf courses, cranberry 
bogs, and retail shopping outlets.  The records will be useful for evaluating 
the efficacy of remediation efforts intended to reduce the nitrogen loading from 
these sources to Waquoit Bay.
		Another focus of long-term research interest is the detection of 
climate change and the determination of its effects on the estuarine 
environment.  Characterizing the variability of the various water column 
parameters, such as their scale, magnitude and frequency, is likely to be 
an important aspect of the estuarine ecosystem that may be sensitive to climate 
change. Related to this focus is an interest in the impact of storms (hurricanes 
and northeasters) and other extreme meteorological events on the estuary. For 
example, what temperature and wind field thresholds exist that might bring about 
or trigger certain conditions within the bay?  The observations recorded by the 
SWMP will allow for these types of studies.      


4)	Research methods:

		YSI 6000 and 6600 series sondes are deployed at each permanent water 
quality monitoring station at the Waquoit Bay Reserve. Since in-situ 
instrumentation can only record conditions at a specific location, permanent 
monitoring stations for SWMP are chosen to be in some way representative of the 
overall estuary. This is difficult in practice since estuaries by their very 
definition are coastal regions where large physical, chemical and biological 
variations tend to occur in space and time, so that often no particular location 
within the system is "typical" of the overall system. Establishing a number of 
stations can overcome this problem somewhat, and as of 2002 four permanent 
stations were established in the Waquoit Bay estuaries. Our current SWMP 
stations are situated so as to be as representative as much as possible of the 
estuary and its inputs/outputs. Additional details concerning the station 
characteristics are discussed in the next section. 
			The YSI sondes measure and record ambient water temperature, 
specific conductivity (and calculate salinity), dissolved oxygen (mg/L and % 
saturated), turbidity (NTU), water level (m), and pH at 30 minute intervals 
during deployment periods extending for approximately two weeks. Note that the 
pressure sensors we currently use are unvented and so variations in 
atmospheric pressure are recorded as changes in water depth (atmospheric data) 
are available from our SWMP meteorological station (as of 1/2002) and other 
nearby meteorological observatories, so it is possible to make this correction 
to the depth data, for increased accuracy. Also, at our Metoxit Point site (from 
12/2000 to 12/2002)  and our Child's River site (from 3/2003 through 12/2003), 
we have been using a YSI chlorophyll 6025 sensor and these data are 
available by contacting us directly at the reserve (and included in the raw 
files sent to CDMO).
			Sondes are deployed and retrieved approximately every two 
weeks. The "old" sonde is retrieved and a "new" replacement sonde is deployed 
immediately so that ideally no record gap occurs. The two week deployment 
duration is constrained by a combination of battery life (shorter life in colder 
waters) and fouling of the DO sensor (and other sensors to a lesser degree) 
during the warm summer months. Prior to deployment (within 24 hrs), each 
instrument is checked and its sensors re-calibrated using standard YSI 
(Operating Manual) protocols. Similarly, after a deployment, each sonde is 
brought back to the laboratory for a post-deployment check, data downloading, 
instrument and sensor cleaning. Salinity sensors are calibrated with reference 
seawater that had been previously analyzed with a Guildline salinometer at the 
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (David Wellwood is the technician 
for this instrument).  pH sensors are calibrated with 7.0 and 10.0 pH standard 
solutions (2-point calibrations). The turbidity standard used was Hach 100 NTU, 
and distilled water (DI) for 0 NTU. Temperature sensors were not calibrated.  
Oxygen sensor membranes were inspected before and after each deployment.  Oxygen 
sensor membranes were replaced 24 hours prior to each deployment when the sensor 
seemed to need reconditioning. Final DO calibration was not done until the 
membrane had been in place for at least 8 hours. As another check on instrument 
performance, in-situ measurements of air and water temperature, DO, salinity, 
water temperature, and pH are made using a hand-held YSI 650 at 
deployment/retrieval times. 
		In 2003, SWMP water quality data were collected more or less 
continuously at our dockside sites, Child's River and Menauhant, from January 
through December, while no data were collected at Sage Lot from January until 
mid- to late April owing to heavy iceover conditions on the bay. Data collection 
at Metoxit Point initially began on January 1, 2003 until the site began to ice 
over. The datalogger was then pulled for the ice season until April 21, 2003. 
Winter 2002 / 2003 was one of the heaviest iceovers for the bay since 1994, with 
significant ice (up to 9" in thickness at maximum) in the open waters of the bay 
from early December 2002 through late March 2003.  The empty sonde moorings / 
silos at the two open water sites remained in place over winter, but both silo 
assemblies received ice damage. The Sage Lot silo was completely destroyed and 
the Metoxit Point silo was dragged by ice over 1 mile and required extensive 
refurbishing. Heavy cold and ice conditions returned in early December 2003, 
affecting operation at the Sage Lot site and so no data were collected for this 
site from early December through the remainder of the year.
		 Two types of mooring silos are used to hold the sondes. The Metoxit 
Point and Sage Lot stations are located offshore and away from shore structures. 
The sonde moorings for these stations consist of a vertical PVC pipe tower (2" 
ID), about 1.5 meters in height) extending from a 120 lb cast concrete base 
resting on the bottom. Attached to this tower is a 0.7 m PVC pipe section (4" 
ID), referred to as the silo, that holds the sonde and is adjustable for setting 
the depth of the sensor package. The sondes are lowered and inserted into the 4" 
PVC silo from the surface at low water, when the top of the tower is only about 
0.3 m below the surface. The lower part of the silo section is perforated with 
numerous 1.5 " holes to allow the YSI sonde's sensors direct exposure to the 
flow of ambient waters. The Metoxit Point and Sage Lot silos are set so that the 
sensor package is 0.7 m and 0.5 off the bottom, respectively.  This ensures that 
the sensors are above the macro algal mats in the case of Metoxit Point, and 
sufficiently into the water column because of the thick eelgrass meadow in Sage 
Lot. The Menauhant and Child's River stations are dock-side locations and their 
moorings are a more typical type of silo – a single PVC section (4" ID) mounted 
vertically on a pier piling. The Menauhant site, located at a yacht club dock, 
is adjacent to a tidal inlet, and the Child's River site, located at commercial 
marina and boat yard, is adjacent to the upper reaches of a tidal river.  The 
base of the these silos are also ventilated with large holes (1.5" diameter) and 
their sensor packages (bottom of the sonde) are both mounted about 0.4 m off the 
bottom.   All mooring silos are painted with antifouling paint at the beginning 
of the spring season, and periodically checked and scrubbed during the summer 
season.
   

5)	Site location and character:

General description of Waquoit Bay estuarine system: 
			The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (WBNERR) 
is located in the northeastern United States on the southern coast of Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts.  About 8,000 people maintain permanent residency in Waquoit Bay's 
drainage area, which covers parts of the towns of Falmouth, Mashpee, and 
Sandwich. During summer months, the population swells 2-3 times with the 
greatest housing concentrations immediate to the coastline (water views and 
frontage). In addition, the upper portions of the watershed include a military 
base, Otis Air Force Base and the Massachusetts Military Reservation, portions 
of which have been designated by the EPA as Superfund sites due to past 
practices of dumping jet fuel and other volatile groundwater contaminants.  
   			WBNERR's estuaries are representative of shallow tidal lagoons 
that occur from Cape Cod to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. WBNERR is within the 
northern edge of the Virginian biogeographic province, on the transitional 
border (Cape Cod) with the Acadian biogeographic province to the north and east. 
Like many embayments located on glacial outwash plains, Waquoit Bay is shallow 
(< 5 m), fronted by prominent barrier beaches (i.e., those of South Cape 
Beach State Park and Washburn Island), and is backed by salt marshes and upland 
coastal forests of scrub pine and oak.  Two narrow, navigable inlets, reinforced 
with granite jetties, pass through two barrier beaches to connect Waquoit Bay 
with Vineyard Sound to the south.  A third shallow and generally un-navigable 
inlet opened through the Washburn Island barrier beach during Hurricane Bob in 
August 1991, finally closed up in February 2002. 
			Bottom sediments in the bay are organic rich silts and medium 
sands. Sediment cores taken in summer of 2002 indicate that the depth of these 
estuarine sediments is up to 9 m thick in places. Thick (up to 0.3 m) macroalgae 
(seaweed) mats overlie much of the bottom of the bay, and largely consist of 
species Cladophora vagabunda, Gracilaria tikvahiayae, and Enteromorpha. The 
dominant marsh vegetation in Waquoit Bay is Spartina alterniflora and 
Spartina patens. Dominant upland vegetation includes mixed forests of red oak, 
white oak, and pitch pine, and other shrubs and plants common to coastal New 
England. Land-use in the bay's watershed is about 60% natural vegetation, but 
the remaining land is largely residential housing, with some commercial (retail 
malls), and minor amounts of agriculture (~3%) (cranberry bogs).
		Dense housing developments cover the two peninsulas that form the 
western shore of the Waquoit Bay estuarine system.  Although the developments 
themselves are outside of the Reserve boundaries, dissolved nitrogen in 
discharges from their septic systems (via groundwater) and in fertilizer run-off 
from their lawns has significant effects on the functioning of the Waquoit Bay 
ecosystem. These impacts have been a primary subject of study at the Reserve 
since its designation (1988).  One outcome of this research has been the 
delineation of sub-watersheds within the overall drainage area for Waquoit Bay, 
of which WBNERR is a small part. This knowledge allows for the design of 
experiments based on the spatial variation of nutrient loading and other land-
use related impacts.
			At the northern end of the bay, an area comprising a separate 
sub-watershed, coastal bluffs of glacial till rise 30 feet above sea level. The 
northern basin of the bay, just below these bluffs, is its deepest area 
(approximately 3 m MLW), while much of the remainder of the bay is about 
1.5 m. Bourne, Bog, and Caleb Ponds are freshwater kettle hole ponds on the 
northern-most shore of the bay.  As components of the same sub-watershed, they 
have a common albeit minor freshwater outflow into the bay's northern basin via 
a narrow channel through a brackish marsh. To the east and south, other sub-
watersheds surround several tidal and freshwater ponds, including Hamblin and 
Jehu Ponds, brackish salt ponds that are connected to the main bay by 
the tidal waters of Little and Great Rivers, respectively.  The shorelines of 
the ponds are developed with residences that are occupied both seasonally and 
year round. Hamblin Pond and Little River are components of one sub-watershed, 
and Jehu Pond and Great River are elements of a separate sub-watershed. Further 
south lies Sage Lot Pond. It is in the least developed sub-watershed and also 
contains a barrier beach and salt marsh ecosystem of the reserve's South 
Cape Beach State Park. To the east of Sage Lot Pond and within the same sub-
watershed, lies the highly brackish Flat Pond. It receives minimal tidal flows 
of salt water from Sage Lot Pond through a narrow, excavated and culverted 
channel. The preponderance of the input to Flat Pond is groundwater and run off, 
both of which are likely affected (e.g., nutrients, pesticides, bacteria) by an 
adjacent golf course and near-by upper-scale residential development.
			The largest source of surface freshwater to Waquoit Bay is the 
Quashnet / Moonakis River. Although named "river", this and Child's River are 
more appropriately described as "streams" because of their small channels and 
discharge ~1.0 CFS.  A component of yet another sub-watershed, it originates in 
Johns Pond situated north of the bay and traverses forests, cranberry 
bogs, residential areas, and the Quashnet Valley Golf Course before entering the 
bay near the southern "boundary" of the northern basin. ("Quashnet" applies to 
that portion of the river within the town of Mashpee, and "Moonakis" refers to 
the brackish estuary at the river's mouth, lying in the town of Falmouth.  
Quashnet will be used hereafter to refer to the entire river.)  The Quashnet 
River's tidal portion has sufficient numbers of coliform bacteria to cause it to 
be closed to shell fishing most of the time. The source(s) of this bacteria 
(human or avian) is unknown at this time.
 			The Childs River is the second largest input of surface 
freshwater to the bay.  A component of  another sub-watershed, it runs through 
densely developed residential areas. The Childs River sub-watershed receives the 
highest nitrogen loading and is the largest nitrogen contributor to the Waquoit 
Bay system of all the sub-watersheds. In the upper tidal portions of the river 
we have consistently recorded the highest chlorophyll levels and the lowest 
dissolved oxygen readings of any region in the bay and so this location 
represents an end-member for looking at anthropogenic inputs and impacts on the 
system.  Another, albeit smaller, source of freshwater is the discharge of Red 
Brook through brackish marshlands into Hamblin Pond.  Additional freshwater 
enters the bay elsewhere through groundwater seepage (perhaps up to 50% of all 
freshwater input into the bay), precipitation and the flows of smaller brooks. 
There is relatively little surface water runoff entering directly into the bay 
due to the high percolation rates of Cape Cod's coarse, sandy soils.
			Knowledge of the homo/heterogeneity of the water masses in 
Waquoit Bay was originally derived from measurements made by reserve staff and 
from data obtained by the reserve's volunteer water quality monitoring group, 
the Waquoit BayWatchers who have collected depth profiles of Waquoit Bay water 
quality since 1993. Subsequent research by reserve staff (including some 
numerical modeling by T. Isaji) has revealed that lateral mixing has 
considerable influence because tidal currents follow a general course through 
the bay. This results in an overall structure to horizontal patterns of water 
quality characteristics. The pattern it produces is a gyre in the central 
portion of the main bay whereby currents follow a generally counter-clockwise 
flow around a central area that exhibits reduced exchange with the remainder 
of the bay. The flushing rate within the gyre is diminished when compared with 
other more peripheral areas of the bay. The location of the gyre meanders 
slightly, apparently under the influence of tides and wind). Because of the 
shallow conditions, restricted tidal inlets, and low amplitude tidal forcing of 
Vineyard Sound here (tides are semi-diurnal with a range about 0.5 m) water 
levels in the bay are also strongly influenced by wind forcing. Southerly winds 
increase tidal heights and advance the phase of the flood and retard the phase 
of ebb (Northerly winds have the opposite effect). 

			The Metoxit Point station (MP) (41º 34.131' N 70º 31.294' W, 
2.2 m deep) initiated in 1998, is located in the main basin of Waquoit Bay and 
was selected to be within or near the outer regions of the gyre (described 
above) and more or less represents "typical" water mass conditions and residence 
times for the bay. The location is at least a half mile from shore, well 
flushed by tides, and is in an area that is minimally disturbed by routine 
activities on the bay (e.g. boat traffic, shell fishing, etc.). Bottom sediments 
at the site are organic rich muds often  overlain by thick agal mats. Because of 
this site's fairly open exposure to south (greatest fetch over the bay), we have 
observed that when sustained southerly winds are greater than about 20 kts, the 
Metoxit Point site experiences increased turbidity (sediment suspension events).  
This year for the first time, the absolute elevation of the station to relative 
to NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum, sometimes referred to as 1929 Sea 
Level) was calibrated. Precision is uncertain at this time (but estimated to be 
within 0.1 m). Depth to base of the sonde (base of the sensor guard) at the 
Metoxit Point site is -1.02 m NGVD. The calibrated mean depth sensor 
height above the guard base for our YSI 6600 instruments is 0.26 m (SD<0.01m). 
Therefore depth readings (uncorrected for air pressure) at this station for this 
	year should be interpreted as water surface heights above -0.76 m NGVD. A mean 
tidal range of 0.46m (SD = 0.17) is calculated based on one month of data (May 2003), with 
a minimum of 0.13 m and a maximum of 0.91 m. Mean monthly salinity range for 
2002 is 4.2 ppt from a mean monthly minimum of 27.8 ppt to 32.0 ppt.
		The Menauhant station (MH) (41º 33.156' N 70º 32.912' W, 1.2 m 
deep), initiated in March 2001, is located within the Eel Pond Inlet at the 
Menauhant Yacht Club dock.  Eel Pond Inlet is the westernmost of the two main 
tidal inlets into the Waquoit Bay system. The site was chosen because it 
occupies one of the strategic locations for gauging the system's water mass 
characteristics. Entering waters represent the marine end-member while outflows 
represent the final product of estuarine water mass modification and export to 
shelf waters.  The site also has easy walk-in access to a secure private pier 
that extends into the throat of the inlet.  Also, because of the turbulent tidal 
flow within the inlet, conditions are vertically well mixed, and the site can be 
maintained year round even through ice-over conditions in the rest of the bay.  
Bottom sediments at this site are clean sands and gravels with almost no 
attached bottom vegetation. Since inception, we have noted that strong south to 
southeast (onshore) winds tend to produce turbidity events at this site from the 
wave induced suspension of fine sediments and organic material in the upstream 
near-shore zone.  While we have found that these type of turbidity events are 
localized to windward near-shore areas in the bay, the transport of these 
sediments at inlet mouths during such times is perhaps a dominant sedimentation 
process within the estuarine system.  In other words while the choice of our 
location may be producing a localized signal in one of our measured parameters 
that signal may reflect key processes in the system at large. This year for the 
first time, the absolute elevation of the station to relative to NGVD (National 
Geodetic Vertical Datum, sometimes referred to as 1929 Sea Level) was 
calibrated. Precision is uncertain at this time (but estimated to be within 0.1 
m). Depth to base of the sonde (base of the sensor guard) at the Menauhant site 
is -0.68 m NGVD. The calibrated mean depth sensor height above the guard base 
for our YSI 6600 instruments is 0.26 m (SD<0.01m). Therefore depth readings 
(uncorrected for air pressure) at this station for this year should be 
	interpreted as water surface heights above -0.42 m NGVD. A mean tidal range 
of 0.48m (SD = 0.19) is calculated based on one month of data (May 2003), with a minimum of 
0.11 m and a maximum of 0.99 m. Mean monthly salinity range for 2002 is 3.9 ppt 
from a mean monthly minimum  of 28.5 ppt to 32.4 ppt.

			The Child's River station (CR) (41º 34.793' N 70º 31.854' W, 
1.2 m deep), initiated in May 2002, is located on a dock piling at Edwards Boat 
Yard, a commercial marina near the upper tidal reaches of of Child's River— one 
of the two main surface fresh water sources to Waquoit Bay (see general 
description of Waquoit Bay watershed above). This location is very strongly 
stratified, characterized by a salt wedge with fresher river water overlying 
saline ocean water. Vertical salinity ranges can run from 0-10 ppm at the 
surface to more than 30 ppm  just 1 m below. The sonde sensors are usually well 
within the salt wedge portion of the water column, nonetheless this location is 
also our freshest SWMP site, and is at the opposite end of Child's River from 
the seaward Menauhant station.  Bottom sediments are fine organic rich muds. 
This location represents the most terrigenously and anthropogenically-impacted 
SWMP site. Monthly water quality, collected near this location for the past 
decade, shows very high chlorophyll concentrations during the warmer months and 
more recent dissolved nutrient records show very high nutrient-loads. Boat 
traffic at the marina likely leads to increased turbidity during the boating 
season as well. As this site is dockside at a private marina, general 
security is high along with easy access. The station is also serviceable year-
round and usually not subject to seasonal shutdown due to ice over.  This year 
for the first time, the absolute elevation of the station to relative to NGVD 
(National Geodetic Vertical Datum, sometimes referred to as 1929 Sea Level) was 
calibrated. Precision is uncertain at this time (but estimated to be within 0.1 
m). Depth to base of the sonde (base of the sensor guard) at the Child's River 
site is -0.86 m NGVD. The calibrated mean depth sensor height above the guard 
base for our YSI 6600 instruments is 0.26 m (SD<0.01m). Therefore depth readings 
(uncorrected for air pressure) at this station for this year should be 
	interpreted as water surface heights above -0.58 m NGVD. A mean tidal range 
of 0.46 m (SD = 0.17) is calculated based on one month of data (May 2003), with a minimum of 
0.11 m and a maximum of 0.95 m. Mean monthly salinity range for 2002 is 14.7 
ppt from a mean monthly minimum  of 15.8 ppt to 30.5 ppt.

			The Sage Lot station (SL) (41º 33.254' N 70º 30.612' W, 1.2 m 
deep), initiated in May 2002, is located in a deeper portion of Sage Lot Pond – 
a small sub-estuary of Waquoit Bay (20 ha) surrounded by salt marsh and barrier 
beach. Its small watershed is the least developed of all of Waquoit Bay's sub-
watersheds and Sage Lot Pond is considered to be its least impacted and 
most pristine sub-estuary.  Bottom sediments are organic rich muds. Sage Lot 
Pond possesses one of the few remaining eelgrass beds in the Waquoit Bay system. 
Indeed the Child's River and Sage Lot Pond sites are considered to represent 
opposite end-members of nutrient-loading and human-induced influence. 
Researchers often locate their experiments in these two locations 
to take advantage of this difference. However, Sage Lot Pond is hydrologically 
connected to an upstream brackish source -- Flat Pond – via a series of tidal 
creeks, drainage ditches and culverts. Flat Pond borders a country club and golf 
course and some concern exists for its impact on the water quality of Sage Lot 
Pond.  Cuurently, Sage Lot Pond is closed to shellfishing because of high fecal 
colliform concentrations, though these are thought to be of avian source. This 
year for the first time, the absolute elevation of the station to relative to 
NGVD (National Geodetic Vertical Datum, sometimes referred to as 1929 Sea Level) 
was calibrated. Precision is uncertain at this time (but estimated to be within 
0.2 m). Depth to base of the sonde (base of the sensor guard) at the Sage Lot 
site is about -0.6 m NGVD. The calibrated mean depth sensor height above the 
guard base for our YSI 6600 instruments is 0.26 m (SD<0.01m). Therefore depth 
readings (uncorrected for air pressure) at this station for this year should be 
	interpreted as water surface heights above -0.3 m NGVD. A mean tidal range 
of 0.40m (SD = 0.14) is calculated based on one month of data (May 2003), with a minimum of 
0.11 m and a maximum of 0.67 m.  Mean monthly salinity range for 2002 is 4.9 
ppt from a mean monthly minimum of 27.2 ppt to 32.1 ppt.


6)	Data collection period:

Data loggers were deployed at Metoxit Point (MP) on April 21, 2003, and 
Menauhant Yacht Club (MH) on January 1, 2003.  Data loggers at Child's River 
(CR) were first deployed on January 1, 2003 and at Sage Lot (SL) on April 21, 
2003. All stations, with the exception of Sage Lot, were in operation from these 
dates through the end of December.  All monitoring is considered long-term.  
Deployment dates and times for 2003 are indicated below:

11)	 Data anomalies:

SMALL NEGATIVE TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: Slight negative turbidity values sometimes 
occur as a result of small calibration offsets. Often these turbidity minimum 
values are between 0 and -2 NTU. In May 2002 we installed new model turbidity 
probes (YSI 6136) on our 6600 YSI data loggers. Due to the larger sampling depth 
of these new probes, larger calibration offsets occurred resulting in somewhat 
lower negative turbidity values (e.g., -2 to -14 NTU). Improvement in our 
calibration methods corrected this larger offset problem. All of these small 
negative and/or zero turbidity values (the minimum for a given deployment) 
should be considered to be within 2 NTU of the true datum for correction 
purposes. Consequently, we have not deleted any of these small negative 
turbidity data. 

BIOLOGICAL-RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: This type anomaly includes turbidity 
readings that are either outside of the normal range or spikes way above 
background and unrelated to increased sediment suspension or decreased water 
column clarity. We believe these records are real (and not sensor malfunction), 
though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These extreme values 
are likely due to biological factors (such as small fish, crabs, or other marine 
organisms). Our criteria for flagging these data are single spikes (above rather 
constant background) over 50NTU that are more than 10 times surrounding values. 
These readings were deleted.

SUSPENSION EVENT RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: This type of anomaly includes 
turbidity readings that were either outside the normal range, or spikes way 
above background that are related to elevated turbidity levels indicative of 
wind wave related suspension events. We believe these are real (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to large floating particles (i.e., seaweeds, 
detritus, etc.) suspended in the water column during storm  events usually from 
strong southerly winds in the Waquoit Bay area. (see end of section 5 for more 
detail on these events at this site). Our criteria for flagging these data are 
values over 100NTU that are more than 5 times the magnitude of surrounding 
values, and linked to high winds.  These readings were deleted.

 

January 2003
Metoxit Point:
Data only collected from 01/01/2003 00:00:00 to 01/01/2003 23:00:00. Battery 
failure ended record after 4 week deployment. Sonde was retrieved 01/02/03 at 
10:00:00 and severe ice conditions prevent further deployment during January.

Menauhant:
a) No data were collected from 01/01/2003  23:00:00 to 01/13/2003 12:30 due to 
battery failure.
	
b)	Extreme low tides  caused sensors to be exposed on the morning and evening 
of  1/22/2003.All data were deleted for the period of exposure (negative depth 
readings).
01/22/2003	06:30:00 to 01/22/2003 08:00:00 
01/22/2003	18:30:00 to 01/22/2003 22:00:00

c)	The following anomalous turbidity data are likely related to a biological 
event and were deleted. See note at the beginning of this section for further 
explanation.
01/24/2003	 12:30:00


Child's River:
a)	No sonde deployed from 01/08/2003 12:30:00 to 1/13/2003 12:30:00. No heat 
in Laboratory-sub-freezing and too cold for calibration.  
	
b)	The following depth readings were found negative owing to extreme low 
tides.  But suspect slight calibration offset due to barometric pressure drift, 
as parameters appear to be consistent with submerged state of sensors. The data 
were not deleted for this period.
01/22/2003	20:30:00 – 21:30:00
	
Sage Lot:
No data were collected this month due to ice.


February 2003
Metoxit Point:

Menauhant:
a)	Anomalous low salinity readings from 02/17/2003 07:30:00 to 02/18/2003 
09:30:00 are thought to be related to very icy conditions and perhaps some sort 
of localized melting. No data were deleted for this period. 

b)	The following depth readings were found negative.  But suspect slight 
calibration offset due to barometric pressure drift, as parameters appear to be 
consistent with submerged state of sensors. The data were not deleted.

02/28/2003	01:30:00
02/28/2003	05:30:00

d)	A combination of a low DO% calibration on 2/6 (85.7%), high DO% calibration
on 2/26 (107.5%) and probe drift resulted in a large DO offset with the 2/26 1100 
deployment. Data were retained.

redeployed was delayed until late April. First deployment began 4/21/03 at 
14:30:00.

b)	All turbidity probes were recalled by YSI for faulty motor repairs.  
Sondes were deployed without them.  No turbidity data were collected from 
04/21/2003 00:00 to 04/30/2003 23:30:00.

Menauhant:
a) The sonde silo was replaced on 04/21/2003 with a new silo. Maintenance took 
about an hour.  The data on 04/21/2003 10:00:00  were deleted.

b) All turbidity probes recalled to YSI for repair.   No turbidity data were 
collected for the entire month.

Child's River:
a)	All turbidity probes recalled to YSI for repair.   No turbidity data were 
collected for the entire month.

b)	Missing data due to deployment / retrieval overlap.

c)	Low salinity anomalies noted on 04/15/2003 and 04/16/2003. Appear valid 
and were not deleted. 

d)	DO data look anomalously high from 04/25/2003 to 04/30/2003. Membrane 
failure not confirmed. DO data were not deleted but are suspect.

12/31/2003 09:00 to 12/31/2003 23:30:00

c)	Missing data at retrieval / deployment overlap time.
12/31/2003  08:30:00
 
Menauhant:
a)	The following depth negative due to extreme low tides. However, as other 
parameters appear to be consistent with submerged sensor condition (depths 
offset due to barometric drift), these data were not deleted.   
12/15/2003	20:30:00 – 22:30:00
		

Child's River:
a)	There are no anomalies this month.

Sage Lot:
a) No pH data 11/18/2003 11:00:00 to 12/04/2003 09:00:00 due to no sensor 
installed on datalogger.
b) Datalogger taken out 12/04/2003 after 09:00:00 due to heavy icing and not re-
deployed due to ice for the remainder of year . No data were collected from 
12/04/2003 09:30:00 thru 
12/31/2003 23:30:00.


 
12)	 Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Upon data review by the CDMO, 
all periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. 
Data are missing due to equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
section 11, Data Anomalies.  The Waquoit Bay NERR Research Coordinator can also 
be contacted about other issues concerning missing or anomalous data.

14)	Other remarks/notes: None

Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
