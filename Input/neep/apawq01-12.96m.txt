2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6000 into the PC6000 software, 
plotted, and initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing data.  Hydrolab 
data are downloaded from the Hydrolab Datasonde 3 to PCPLUS software.  Both YSI 
and Hydrolab raw data files are then downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) 
and imported into Microsoft Excel as a comma-space delimited file (.csv).  These 
raw data files are then organized into standardized monthly data sets using the 
import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, 
import the raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters 
for depth readings if necessary, and save the monthly files as either a .csv or 
.xls file.  Once in monthly format, these files are then run through the 
cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which identify outliers, insure correct number of data 
points for each Date/Hour count, and format the columns in the correct order and 
size.  The monthly files are then carefully edited by staff for data anomalies 
which are identified in Section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this document.  Any data 
that are deleted by staff are replaced with periods and identified in Section 12 
(Missing Data) of this document.   Monthly edited files are then sent as .xls 
files, along with an updated metadata form, to CDMO.

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the 
Tates Hell Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage 
period and allowed increased runoff with a concommittant increase in pH which 
had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  Because of this 
some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was done.  
A large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant will allow them to 
begin restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  
Positioning the dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay will allow the 
Reserve to monitor changes in water quality during this restoration effort. 




4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the 
NERRS national monitoring effort.  Prior to this, ANERR has been and continues 
to monitor three stations in the Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, 
using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's.  East Bay (bottom) is one of these stations and 
will be used in this monitoring program in addition to the YSI datalogger placed 
near the surface at this site. Since a Hydrolab datalogger was initially 
installed at the bottom at the East Bay station, we continued to use the 
Hydrolab brand in order to keep the data consistent with the previous two years 
of data.

Prior to deployment, both the YSI 6000 and the Datasonde 3 are calibrated for 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, and pH following the procedures outlined 
in the YSI Operating and Service Manual (with addendum 7/94) and the Hydrolab 
Operating Manual, respectively.  Lab grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) 
are initially used to calibrate the YSI's, which are then used to check working 
standards made up and used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab grade 
standards are also used periodically to check the accuracy of the working 
salinity standards.  The only variation from the manual is the use of only one 
pH standard for one-point calibration of pH rather than three-point calibration.  
The membranes for the dissolved oxygen probe are installed at least 12 hours 
prior to calibration.  Depth is set to 0.0 meters in the lab.  A turbidity probe 
was added to the YSI 6000 in December 1996 and is calibrated using a lab grade 
(Fisher Brand) 40 NTU standard and deionized water (0 NTU).

Both YSI and Hydrolab dataloggers are attached to the same piling by divers.  
The YSI is oriented with the probes upward in order to measure as close to the 
surface as possible.  The dataloggers are first attached to a stainless steel 
(SS) bar using  2 SS hose clamps, which is then attached to the piling using two 
additional SS hose clamps.  A SS cable with cable clamp is then inserted through 
one of the eye-hooks on the datalogger and around the piling as a safety cable.  
The top of the SS bar is bent at 90 degrees to provide protection for the 
datalogger from boats, propellers, fishing line, or oyster tongs.  Every two 
weeks the dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected.  
Freshly calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or 
no data gaps in the 30 minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the 
northwestern part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located 
adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola 
Bay system, including 20 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both 
natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a 
causeway and is located to the north of the bay proper.  The sampling site is 
located in the upper reaches of East Bay and is influenced by local runoff from 
Tates Hell, the East Bay marshes, and distributary flow, some of which comes 
from the Apalachicola River via the East River.  The piling location is latitude 
29(47.15' N and longitude 84(52.52' W.  Normal tidal range is approximately 0.5 
meters.  Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt but is generally in the low range due 
to the freshwater input from the Tate's Hell drainage.  The freshwater input is 
very tanic and usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are not 
quantified due to the diverse sources of the runoff.  Depth at mean high water 
is 2.2 meters.  The bottom type is soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with 
no vegetation present.

6. Data collection period:
East Bay surface sampling with the YSI began on April 17, 1995.  East Bay bottom 
sampling began on May 1, 1995. Both continue through December 31 of this year.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's to monitor water quality at three 
stations in Apalachicola Bay since May of 1992.  One of these stations was moved 
from the mid-bay area near the Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site 
in January of 1993.  The other two are located on two of the largest 
commercially important oyster bars in the bay.  These stations, like East Bay, 
are intended to be long-term.

fouling or drift in calibration in the instrument that was

		East Bay Bottom (EB)
		A)  All turbidity values for the entire month are missing due to the 
absence of a 			      turbidity probe.

		B)  Low D.O. values (%sat and mg/L) for the following date/times 
were 				      considered suspect and deleted due to the probe 
being out of tolerance during 			      calibration:
			10/22/96 11:00:00 through 10/31/96 23:30:00
