2.  Entry verification:

The data are directly downloaded in the YSI-PC6000 format (as a .dat file) and 
the Comma Delimited format (as a .csv file) from the dataloggers to an IBM 
laptop.  The data are reviewed using the PC6000 software (Eco-Watch).  Graphs 
and basic statistics are then generated with the Eco-Watch program and the 
information is printed out for each data file.  These graphs are used to 
determine any obvious data outliers and sonde and/or probe malfunction.  All 
downloaded data files from the dataloggers (both raw unedited .dat and .csv 
files) are then transferred via disk to a Power Mac G3, where all files are 
reviewed and formatted for CDMO and stored.  Here the raw unedited .csv data 
files are imported into Microsoft Excel 98.  After a complete month of data has 
been recorded, each file is ready to review, which requires several steps.  The 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macros are used for all data.  A data file is created 
(from the merged raw unedited .csv data files) in Excel format with a full month 
of data.  The first step is to make sure that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order, specified by the NERR CDMO.  If any parameters are not collected 
due to probe failure or other causes, the cells with this missing data are 
filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in the appropriate 
section of the metadata.  Secondly, missing dates and times are inserted in the 
data file where data were not collected due to maintenance, sonde failure, etc., 
and the cells with this missing data are filled in with periods (.) and 
documented and explained in the appropriate section of the metadata.  The first 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is then run to determine if there are any missing 
dates and times; and if so these missing dates and times are inserted.  Next, 
the second NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is used to find and filter all data 
readings outside the sonde specification measuring range for each parameter.  
Here the outlier data generated by the second macro are examined and 
determined as either explained or unexplained anomalies, as specified by NERR 
CDMO Operations Manual (Version 3.0).  All anomalous data (explained and 
unexplained) are documented and explained in the appropriate sections of the 
metadata.  The explained anomalous data are then removed from the data file and 
replaced by periods.  The unexplained anomalous data are investigated for 
validity based on weather data, field observations, instrument diagnostics, and 
Eco-Watch printouts.  If these data are rejected from the file then these are 
removed and replaced by periods.  Lastly, the third and final NERR CDMO QA/QC 
Excel macro is used to reformat all the columns in the data file to the correct 
number of significant digits.  After this last step, once the file has been 
completely formatted and edited as specified by NERR CDMO, the file is saved as 
a Tab delimited (.txt) text file and sent by FTP to the CDMO.  The metadata form 
is also submitted with the data file to the CDMO, sent also as a text file (text 
only with line breaks).  Scott Orringer is responsible for this task of entry 
verification with the analyses of suspect and anomalous data.  Michele Dionne 
supervises, proofs and answers questions with the evaluation of suspect and 
anomalous data.

The use of the newest (Version 2.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 
System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water Quality 
Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in July 1999 when they became 
available.



3.  Research objectives:

	The Webhannet River estuary is located in proximity to heavily used 
beaches in Wells, Maine.  It has a shoreline that is highly developed with 
residential and commercial structures.  The estuary receives water from a 14 sq. 
mi. watershed that is well forested.  We are measuring variations in hydrologic 
variables in the Webhannet River estuary at the Head of Tide and at the Inlet.  
Data from Head of Tide will integrate surface and ground water inputs (from both 
point and non-point sources) from the freshwater watershed into the estuary.  
Data from the Inlet will integrate surface and ground water inputs from the 
freshwater watershed and the estuarine watershed.  Differences in data between 
the Head of Tide and the Inlet will indicate inputs from the estuarine portion 
of the watershed (on the ebb tide), and inputs from the Gulf of Maine on the 
flood tide.  The instruments will track runoff events via salinity, and will 
measure pollutant-carrying sediment particles via turbidity.  Our working 
hypothesis is that the freshwater watershed is the primary source of sediment 
and therefore potential NPS pollutants in the estuary.  These two variables will 
indicate the potential for non-point source pollutants to enter the estuary, and 
whether they are of upland, estuarine or Gulf of Maine origin.  Other variables 
measured by the data loggers (DO, temperature, pH, specific conductivity, and 
water level) will provide important baseline data to track changes in the 
estuary's physico-chemical parameters over the long term.  These variables can 
be affected by changes in human water use, and by natural or human induced 
changes in Inlet and river channel morphology, climate, and organic loadings.  
The Inlet site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term 
monitoring site.  The Head of Tide site is relatively unimpacted, located just 
east of the Route One bridge, and is our ³roving² site.


4.  Research Methods

	The Wells NERR YSI monitoring program began in April 1995 at one site 
(Head of Tide site-HT) and May 1995 at a second site (Inlet site-IN) in the 
Webhannet River estuary.  The two data loggers are installed with bottom 
moorings, as described below.  Both data loggers have 1/4 inch black vector mesh 
placed on the outside (using rubber bands) of the sonde guard to prevent fouling 
and unwanted animals.  All deployment structures (PVC tubes) described below are 
labeled with the Wells NERR information.

*IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN) where our telemetry unit is 
stationed: A new vented level YSI 6600 with its new vented level cable was 
deployed to collect its first data on 5/4/99 at 12:00.  The YSI telemetry unit 
began collecting its first data on 3/16/98 at 10:30:00.  

The Inlet site (IN) deployment methods are different than the other site (HT), 
due to the installation of a YSI telemetry unit.  A 23 foot, 4-inch diameter 
high-grade PVC tube was installed against a dock piling.  Four steel flat bars 
with bolts were used to attach this 23-foot PVC tube against the dock piling.  
A 3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer was glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to 
allow the sonde to sit exactly 1.0 meter (3.28 ft) off the bottom.  Several 
vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An L-shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16) is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the L shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the L-shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A PVC threaded cap 
screws into the threaded top of the PVC tube, also for security.  A hole was 
created in the PVC cap to allow the sonde to hook up with the telemetry unit 
using the 50-foot cable.  The collection of data parameters at the Inlet (IN) 
site is slightly different then at the roving (HT) site, due to the telemetry 
unit installation.  Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen due 
to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane and probe 
fouling.  Battery power is not needed anymore within the sonde itself (although, 
battery power is needed during calibrations and downloading) at the time of 
deployment at this site because of the telemetry unit's solar batter power.  
Measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and turbidity are recorded at 30 minute 
intervals throughout the deployment period.  Time, date, and battery voltage are 
no longer programmed to be recorded by the sonde, since these parameters are 
already programmed with the Eco-Watch Program (see YSI's Eco-Watch Users Guide).

	The other site, Head of Tide (HT), is deployed similarly, except for sonde 
height off the bottom (see below).  This site uses a 5 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube.  The PVC tube is attached to a 12 foot, heavy steel 
signpost using a stainless steel bolt at the bottom of the tube, a stainless 
steel cable wrap at the top, and several thick electrical cable ties in between.  
The steel signpost was pounded in about 7 feet into the river bottom, such that 
the bottom of the PVC tube was flat on the river bottom.  The PVC tube has one 3 
by 1.5 inch PVC transducer glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to allow 
the sonde to sit exactly at a certain height off the bottom (see below).  
Several vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An L shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16) is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the L-shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the L-shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A flotation buoy is 
tied to the PVC tubes incase the deployment structure ever gets dislodged.  The 
deployment depth for the Head of Tide site (HT) is such that the probe-end of 
the data logger is secured 0.30 meters (1.0 ft) off the bottom.	

	Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen for the data sonde 
due to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane, probe 
fouling, and limited battery power.  Measurements of temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and 
turbidity are recorded at 30 minute intervals throughout the deployment period.
	After the deployment period, the data logger is brought back into the 
Wells Reserve Laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and calibration.  These 
procedures are carried out to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.  
Calibration standards are needed and used for only specific conductivity (10 
mS/cm), pH (buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10), and turbidity (100 NTU).  
Conductivity and pH standards are purchased from Fisher Scientific.  Turbidity 
standards are purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc. (Redwood City, CA).  
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced and sit 6-24 hours before each 
deployment.  After approximately 6-24 hours of down time for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration, the YSI Datalogger is redeployed for another 
sampling period.  Also, with our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the 
amount of time of missing data from calibrations and maintenance for this site.

Note:  The Wells NERR two Drakes Island sites (see 1996-1997 metadata) are 
currently being monitored (since 1996), but we are using the data for another 
project (CICEET-Wells Harbor dredge; see Section 7-Associated Researchers and 
Projects); and are not collecting the dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, and 
pH parameters.

The use of the newest (Version 2.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 
System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water Quality 
Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in July 1999 when they became 
available.
	

5.  Site location and character:    

	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York County, 
within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and faces the Atlantic 
Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 miles) south of Portland, 
Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, Massachusetts.  The Reserve 
encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of Maine coastline of tidally flushed 
wetlands, riparian and transitional upland fields and forests within the Little 
River Estuary and the larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in 
the sandy glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers empty 
into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles along the 
Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river's Inlet are double spit barrier beaches 
attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system is approximately 5 sq. km and 
is composed of large intertidal marshes (predominantly S. patens and S. 
alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed 
for the Webhannet River estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 
streams, brooks or creeks that enter the estuary.  These tributaries flow across 
sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the impermeable sandy mud of 
the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The Webhannet River is 
connected to the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a spring tidal prism of 
28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). The force and volume of tidal action affect the 
salinity level of both rivers.  In the Wells region, the annual mean wave height 
is almost 20 inches.  The estuarine system is dominated by semi-diurnal tides 
having a range of 8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into both 
estuaries is moderate to low (on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), 
especially in the summer, because of the rivers relatively small drainage areas 
and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The relatively low flows from these 
two rivers taken in with the 20 inch per year average runoff of the area 
surrounding the estuaries combine to form a fresh water flow that is dwarfed by 
tidal flushing.  Twelve-foot tides dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet 
estuary, which has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet estuary, 
fed by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and greatly 
developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for comparison with the 
relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land use of the Webhannet estuary 
include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh water, and tidal marsh; a total of 
63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 18.6% for developed land (compared to a 
total of 5.7% development in the Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 
1997).
	There are two sampling sites in the Webhannet River estuary.  These are 
located at the Head of Tide and at the Inlet.  The tidal range at each of these 
sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.   
	The Head of Tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just 
downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 
deg 17' 54.25227" Latitude, 70 deg 35' 13.82728" Longitude).  Route One is used 
heavily with traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  
This site has soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide 
depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean 
of 3.6 ppt.  These headwaters of the Webhannet are relatively undeveloped.  This 
site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is our roving 
site.
	The Inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the 
Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19' 12.44804" Latitude, 70 deg 33' 13.82728" 
Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an extensive wetland/salt 
marsh area that is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most 
recently dredged in 1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing 
and recreational boats.  The mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the 
Atlantic Ocean.  This channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a 
predominately sand substrate and is characterized by strong current during 
incoming and outgoing tides.  The salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean 
of 31 ppt.  The Inlet site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is 
our long-term monitoring site.

6.  Data collection period:

	The Webhannet River Head of Tide (HT) site data collection was re-deployed 
(after being pulled in December 1995, December 1996, December 1997, and December 
1998) on March 11, 13:00 and pulled after December 31, 23:30 for the winter 
months to prevent ice damage.  This site gets a large amount of ice coverage 
from December through late March.
	The Webhannet River Inlet (IN) site data collection began May 29, 1995, 
13:00.  The IN datalogger is ongoing throughout the year and is considered our 
long-term monitoring site, as this site remains relatively ice-free.
	
7.  Associated researchers and projects:

WELLS NATIONAL ESTUARINE RESEARCH RESERVE RESEARCH AT THE RESERVE 1999-2000:

The Research Program at the Wells NERR conducts and supports research, 
monitoring, workshops, and research/resource management planning of relevance at 
local, regional and national levels.  The overall aim of our work is to produce 
science-based information needed to sustain or restore Gulf of Maine coastal 
habitats and resources, especially those found in salt marsh estuaries and 
watersheds.  During 1999-2000 twenty-three different studies (involving 79 
scientists, students, and staff from the Reserve, 26 academic institutions and 
19 resource management groups) focused on several related themes: 1) the quality 
of water resources in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds 2) land conservation 
strategies to protect coastal watersheds 3) factors controlling salt marsh 
accretion, erosion and plant community vigor 4) the value of salt marsh as 
habitat for fish, shellfish and birds, and 5) restoration of salt marsh habitat 
degraded through human actions.

Estuarine Water Resource Quality

Water quality is monitored continuously at several stations with automated 
instruments as part of a NERRS System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), as well as 
bimonthly at 15-20 stations through our WET volunteer monitoring program.  The 
WET program also monitors two important biological parameters: fecal coliform 
bacterial contamination (an indicator of human health risk) and phytoplankton 
productivity (an indicator of estuarine health).  These data have 1) allowed us 
to identify several bacterial hot spots that we will be working to eliminate, 
2) are used to identify and open areas safe for shellfishing, and 3) have 
uncovered a relation between tides and low dissolved oxygen (a stressful 
condition for marine life) that needs further study.  Our water quality work has 
contributed to the designation of several Priority Watersheds in coastal 
Southern Maine by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 

Coastal Conservation Strategies

The Coastal Mosaic Project is a new program developed in response to requests 
for support from the conservation community to increase the quantity, quality 
and ecological integrity of conserved lands in our region.  Research staff 
organizes and facilitate meetings, workshops, and communications for 18 partner 
conservation groups.  A key element of the Project is the Conservation Resource 
Center, a Reserve staffed GIS facility with a growing database able to provide 
maps of property, natural features and other data needed to develop effective 
conservation goals and strategies.  The Project is nearing completion of 
conservation lands maps for 13 Southern Maine coastal towns, and is undertaking 
an initiative to develop coastal watershed conservation strategies for 12 
coastal watersheds within these towns.  The Reserve has a particular interest in 
educating communities about the ecologic and economic benefits of land 
conservation, especially along estuarine and riverine shorelines.

Salt Marsh Habitats and Communities

Factors that control the dynamics and vigor of salt marsh plant communities and 
marsh peat formation consequently determine the ability of a salt marsh to 
persist in the face of sea level rise.  Through a combination of experimental 
manipulations and long term monitoring, a number of multi-year studies are 
currently producing data to answer questions concerning the sustainability of 
salt marsh habitats in this region.  These studies are looking at nutrient-plant 
relations, plant community responses to physical and hydrologic disturbance, and 
the relative contribution of short-term natural events (e.g. storms) and human 
activities (dredging, tidal restriction) on patterns of sediment accretion and 
erosion.  The Reserve's marshes and beaches are already among the best studied 
sites in the U.S. with regard to long term accretion and erosion (over thousands 
of years).

HABITAT VALUE FOR FISH, SHELLFISH AND BIRDS

The Reserve combines long-term monitoring with periodic surveys and short-term 
experiments to identify species and measure trends and changes in populations of 
fish, crustaceans, clams and birds.   We have 10 years of data on upland and 
shore birds with which to assess the status of resident and migratory avian 
populations, and 8 years of wading bird data that we use as a gross level 
indicator of salt marsh health, which appears to be stable.  Our periodic 
larval, juvenile and adult fish surveys have produced the best available data 
for fish utilization of salt marsh estuaries in the Gulf of Maine.  In the 
coming year we plan to develop a long-term monitoring program for finfish that 
will be coordinated with other sites within the Gulf of Maine and along the east 
coast.  Since 1994 we have been conducting surveys and field experiments to look 
at the survival and growth of hatchery seed, juvenile and adult softshell clam 
with regard to habitat characteristics and predation by the invasive green crab.

Salt Marsh Degradation and Restoration

 Salt marsh ecosystems in the Gulf of Maine have sustained themselves in the 
face of sea-level rise and other natural disturbances for nearly five thousand 
years.  Since colonial times large areas of salt marsh (up to half of the total 
area) have been lost through diking, draining and filling.  Today, the remaining 
marshland is fairly well protected from outright destruction, but during the 
past 100 years, and especially since the 1950¹s, salt marshes have been divided 
into fragments by roads, causeways, culverts and tide gates.  Most of these 
fragments have severely restricted tidal flow, leading to chronic habitat 
degradation and greatly reduced access for fish and other marine species.  Since 
1991, the Wells Reserve has been studying the impact of these restrictions on 
salt marsh functions and values, and the response of salt marshes to tidal 
restoration.  We have been working to promote an awareness of the damage being 
done and the benefits of salt marsh restoration throughout the Gulf of Maine.

Research Program Update:
In addition to the Reserve-sponsored projects outlined above, numerous visiting 
investigators will be involved in on-site research.  Topics include: the effects 
of land use, sea level, and climate on estuarine productivity; the relationship 
between soil nutrients and plant community patterns; the influence of soil 
salinity on plant community interactions; the effect of tidal restriction on 
marsh peat accretion; the comparative ecology of fringe marshes and back barrier 
marshes; habitat use by upland birds, and the ecology of lyme disease.

 The Wells NERR Research Dept. was just funded to work on the following project 
this spring:  Community-based plan to manage current and future threats from 
point and non- point source pollution in the Merriland River and Branch Brook 
Watersheds of the Little River Estuary.  There will be a shoreline survey of 
the Little River and its Watershed this March.  The preliminary goal of this 
project is a) to produce a community-based watershed management plan for the 
Branch Brook, Merriland River, Little River combined watersheds, and b)to convey 
the elements of the plan to critical audiences through a succinct road show, 
culminating in a public event to showcase the plan.

 The Wells NERR Research Dept. was also funded this year to work on the 
following project: Measuring the Health of the York River Ecosystem using Fish 
as Indicators.  The results of this study will provide information on the 
ecology and fisheries of the York River that is essential for wise stewardship 
of this precious but threatened community resource.  The goal of this project is 
to assist the York Rivers Association and partners in their work as stewards of 
the York River and its watershed, through an assessment of the current and 
potential fish habitat value of this exemplary coastal ecosystem.

The Wells NERR Research Dept. is involved with the following two CICEET* 
Projects:

I. Project Title: Estuarine Responses to Dredging: Analysis of Sedimentary and 
Morphological Change in Back Barrier Marsh to Aid Local Management and Develop a 
Regional Management Tool
Principal Investigator (s): Michele Dionne, Wells NERR, ME; Duncan Fitzgerald, 
Boston University; Joe Kelley, University of Maine; David Burdick and Larry 
Ward, University of New Hampshire

Management Issue: Coastal management tool for assessing the impacts of dredging 
in estuaries
Project Summary: An adequate supply of sediment is essential for maintaining 
salt marshes.  Human activities, such as channel dredging and tidal restriction 
due to road construction, can alter water flows in estuaries and result in 
dramatic changes in salt marsh sediment supply, affecting the speed of salt 
marsh erosion.  The objective of this project is to determine the impact of 
dredging and tidal restriction on salt marshes in the Wells NERR.  A digital 
coastal management guide will be created on CD ROM, providing coastal managers 
with useful conceptual models for predicting the impacts of dredging and other 
activities that affect water flow and sediment deposition in salt marshes.

II. Project Title: Application of a Continuous Imaging Flow Cytometer for 
Monitoring Estuarine Microplankton 
Principal Investigators: Mike Sieracki and Chris. Sieracki, Bigelow Laboratory 
for Ocean Studies

Management Issue: New technology for detecting harmful algal blooms
Project Summary: Marine plankton is a significant component of highly productive 
estuaries, affecting the distribution of oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants.  
Estuarine marine plankton is also the primary food for the larvae of many 
commercially and ecologically important finfish and shellfish. In addition to 
their highly productive role, some species of plankton occasionally form 
nuisance or toxic blooms that affect human health as well as fish and shellfish. 
This project is developing an imaging system, calledFlowCam, to continuously 
monitor plankton for the presence and abundance of harmful algal species.  The 
same technology could also be used to monitor the effects of harbor dredging on 
plankton.

The Wells NERR Research Dept. is assisting with the maintenance and data 
collection of the FlowCAM instrument and FlowCAM computer.

10.  Data anomalies:

January, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until March.

Inlet: 
Depth data for the month of January is suspect possibly due to the presence
of ice in the deployment tube.  Depth was about half its normal range.  Data 
retained.  

No data collected from 1/1 0:00 through 1/2 21:30 due to a data gap.  Logger 
did not record data within this time range, possibly due to an overwrite of 
data.
No pH data from 1/2 22:00 to 1/20 10:30 due to a pH probe crash.  These data 
were suspect and deleted.  
The post-cal was unreliable and the probe could not be recalibrated upon return 
to the lab.
The following were episodes that sonde was suspected out of the water, due to 
shallow positive and negative depths, low specific conductivity and salinity, 
cold temperatures, high rollover turbidity, and high dissolved oxygen and 
percent saturation data.  This could have been due extremely cold winter 
temperatures and possible ice in sonde deployment tube.  These data were suspect 
and deleted.
1/3 4:00-6:30, 17:30-18:00
1/4 5:30-7:00, 17:30-20:30
1/5 6:00-8:00, 18:30-21:00
1/6 19:30-21:00
1/7 20:00-22:30
1/14 17:00 - 18:00	
1/16 15:30-17:30

1/18 17:00-18:30
1/19 17:30-19:30
1/20 6:00-7:30
The following are shallow positive depth data (23 values with a range of 0.0 to 
0.09 m; mean of 0.045 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other 
parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted.
1/3 19:00
1/4 5:00
1/6 21:30
1/7 8:00-9:30
1/12 13:30-14:00

1/18 16:30, 19:00
1/19 5:00, 7:00, 20:00
1/20 5:30
The following are shallow negative depth data (5 values with a range of ­0.01 to 
­0.04 m; mean of ­0.022 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other 
parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted.
1/3 18:30
1/19 5:30-6:30, 17:00
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 1/2 22:30-1/13 9:30 (logging period recorded 39 anomalies), possibly due 
to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following were high positive turbidity spikes, including one roll over 
episode (>1000 NTU), that were not consistent with the overall data record.  
This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these 
values were bad.
1/3 7:00 (1019), 7:30 (399), 8:00 (173)
1/4 21:00 (286)
1/5 8:30 (956),	9:00 (439), 21:30 (387),	22:00	(68)
The following are 16 suspect dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values, 
due to extremely high outliers not consistent with the overall data record 
(range from 14.4/122.5 to 21.2 mg/l and 190.0%, mean of 18.0 mg/l and 159.7%).  
These high outliers fell in between the normal, consistent range from 1/4 22:00
 through 1/5 5:30.  Although these suspect values were not consistent with the 
overall data record, they were not deleted as they do not fall out of the probe
 range.  Other parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.   


February, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until March.

Inlet: 
The following was a high positive turbidity spike that was not consistent with 
the overall data record. This suspect datum was not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that this value was bad.
2/28 2:00 (47.0)

March, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
Small zero and/or negative turbidity values were collected sporadically 
throughout the following time span: 3/11 13:00-3/31 9:00 (logging period 
recorded 257 anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data 
were not deleted.
The following was a high positive turbidity spike that was not consistent with 
the overall data record. This suspect datum was not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that this value was bad.
3/29 2:30 (165.0)

Inlet: 
No data on 3/3 11:30 due to a data gap.  Logger did not record data possibly due 
to an overwrite of data.
The following were high positive turbidity spikes, including one roll over 
episode (>1000 NTU), that were not consistent with the overall data record.  
This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these 
values were bad.

April, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: 
Small zero and/or negative turbidity values were collected sporadically 
throughout the following time span: 4/13 12:30-4/27 5:30 (logging period 
recorded 158 anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data 
were not deleted.
The following are shallow positive depth data (63 values with a range of 0.04 to 
0.09 m; mean of 0.074 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other 
parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted.
4/13 11:00-19:30
4/14 0:00-7:30, 12:00-16:30
4/26 10:00-18:00
No turbidity data from 4/27 8:30 to 4/29 11:30 due to a turbidity probe 
malfunction.

Inlet:
No data from 4/1 0:00 through 4/30 23:30 due to a telemetry unit battery crash 
(continued from the 3/29 deployment) and telemetry unit downtime (as we were 
getting prepared for the deployment of the new vented level YSI 6600 ­ see 
Section 4, Research Methods).

May, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
The following are shallow positive depth data (51 values with a range of 0.052 
to 0.099 m; mean of 0.082 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other 
parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted.

5/23	20:00-23:30
5/24	0:00-4:00, 13:30-22:30
There were two high positive turbidity spikes on 5/13 3:00 (539.7)* and 5/19 
14:00 (557.2) that were not consistent with the overall data record.  These 
suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values 
are bad.  
*The first of these data points is not included in the range of high positive 
turbidity spikes described just below, even though it was within this range.
There was a continuous range of high positive turbidity spikes from 5/11 6:00 
through 5/15 21:00 (except for 5/13 3:00; which is mentioned above) (222 values 
with a range from 4.0-233.9; mean of 63.15) that were not consistent with the 
overall data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values are bad.  (Although the first few spikes are 
not normally labeled anomalous as they are not considerably high spikes, they 
are included in this range because of continuously increasing values). 

Inlet:
No data collected on the following dates/times; due to a data gap.  Logger did 
not record data within this time range, possibly due to an overwrite of data.
5/7 0:00 to 5/12 9:00
5/14 10:00-17:00

There was a continuous range of high positive turbidity spikes from 6/25 15:30 
through 6/27 2:30 (71 values with a range from 27.3 to 434.8 NTU; mean of 
141.28) that were not consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect 
data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.  
(Although the first few spikes are not normally labeled anomalous as they are 
not considerably high spikes, they are included in this range because of 
continuously increasing values). 
There was one suspect dissolved oxygen (15.0 mg/l) and percent saturation (188.2%) 
spike on 6/28 11:30 that was not consistent with the overall data record.  
This suspect data spike was not deleted.


Inlet:
No data collected on the following dates/times; due to a data gap.  Logger 
either (1) did not record data within this time range, possibly due to an 
overwrite of data; or (2) did record the same data values because of an 
overwrite (these data were deleted).
6/2 14:30-20:00
6/18 14:30 to 6/23 16:30
No turbidity data from 6/1 0:00 through 6/30 11:30 due to a turbidity probe 
malfunction.
Small negative turbidity values were collected sporadically throughout the 
following time span: 6/30 18:00-23:30 (logging period recorded 12 anomalies), 
possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.

July, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: 
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 7/1 0:00 through 7/4 
1:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe malfunction (DO 
charge upon return was below the acceptable range).
Small zero and/or negative turbidity values were collected sporadically 
throughout the following time span: 7/3 17:30-7/4 0:00 (logging period recorded 
6 anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
There were two consecutive pH spikes on 7/2 14:30 (8.3) and 15:00 (8.0) that 
were not consistent with the overall data record.  These data were not deleted, 
as the cause was most likely from a higher than normal tidal range (a regular 
monthly occurrence) at this Head of Tide site.
No data collected from 7/4 2:00 through 7/31 23:30 due to a major battery crash, 
where battery voltage dropped quickly from 12.0 to 6.1 volts within 
approximately a 5 day span.  Possible causes of this crash (after conferring 
with YSI engineers)  include static electricity from a car seat prior to 
deployment or a nearby lightning strike.

Inlet:
No data collected on the following dates/times; due to a data gap.  Logger 
either (1) did not record data within this time range, possibly due to an

7/22 15:30-18:30
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 7/1 0:00-7/31 1:30 (logging period recorded 569 anomalies), possibly due 
to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data on 7/5 23:30 are 
suspect as they were small, negative values which are outside the listed range 
of the dissolved oxygen probe.  These suspect values were not consistent with 
the overall data record, and were deleted on the basis of absolute data 
rejection.  Other parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration 
were good.
The following are episodes of low dissolved oxygen (range from 0.1 to 2.7 mg/l, 
mean of 1.6 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 0.6 to 35.2%, mean of 
19.64%) during several low tide fluctuations that were not consistent with the 
overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to the consistency of 
the overall data record).  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values are bad.  Other parameters, the dissolved 
oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.

August, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No data collected from 8/1 0:00 through 8/17 11:00 due to a major battery crash 
(continuation from 7/4 2:00 crash), where battery voltage dropped quickly from 
12.0 to 6.1 volts within approximately a 5 day span.  Possible causes of this 
crash (after conferring with YSI engineers) include static electricity from a 
car seat prior to deployment or a nearby lightning strike.
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 8/17 11:30 through 8/24 
5:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe malfunction (DO 
charge upon return was below the acceptable range).
The following are shallow positive depth data (93 values with a range of 0.0 to 
0.099 m; mean of 0.023 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other

8/24 0:00-5:30
No data collected from 8/24 6:00 through 8/31 23:30 due to a SECOND major 
battery crash (see above), where battery voltage dropped quickly from 12.0 to 
6.0 volts within approximately a 8 day span. Possible causes of this crash 
(after conferring with YSI engineers) include static electricity from a car seat 
prior to deployment or a nearby lightning strike.

Inlet:
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 8/3 14:30- 15:30 and 8/28 00:00 - 13:30 (logging period recorded 14 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
The following are episodes of low dissolved oxygen (range from 1.7 to 3.1 mg/l, 
mean of 2.67 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 19.3 to 37.8%, mean of 
32.76%) during several low tide fluctuations that were not consistent with the 
overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to the consistency of 
the overall data record).  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values are bad.  Other parameters, the dissolved 
oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.

8/15 21:30 (1665), 23:00 (1307)
8/16 1:30 (1287), 5:00 (1609)
No data collected on 8/18 10:00-14:30; due to a data gap.  Logger did not record 
data within this time range, possibly due to an overwrite of data.


September, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No data collected from 9/1 0:00 through 9/30 23:30 due to a SECOND major battery 
crash (a continuation from the 8/24 6:00 crash), where battery voltage dropped 
quickly from 12.0 to 6.0 volts within approximately a 8 day span.  Possible 
causes of this crash (after conferring with YSI engineers) include static 
electricity from a car seat prior to deployment or a nearby lightning strike.

Inlet: 
There was one suspect dissolved oxygen (10.7 mg/l) and percent saturation (129.9%) 
spike on 9/27 12:30 that was not consistent with the overall data record.  
This suspect data spike was not deleted.

October, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No data collected from 10/1 0:00 through 10/31 23:30 due to a SECOND major 
battery crash (a continuation from the 8/24 6:00 crash), where battery voltage 
dropped quickly from 12.0 to 6.0 volts within approximately a 8 day span.  
Possible causes of this crash (after conferring with YSI engineers) include 
static electricity from a car seat prior to deployment or a nearby lightning 
strike.

Inlet: 
The following are 9 suspect dissolved oxygen and percent saturation values, due 
to extremely high outliers not consistent with the overall data record (range 
from 9.9/112.6 to 31.1 mg/l and 356%, mean of 19.22 mg/l and 221.16%).  These 
high outliers fell in between the normal, consistent range from 10/5 10:30 
through 10/6 12:00.  Although these suspect values were not consistent with the 
overall data record, they were not deleted, as they do not fall out of the probe 
range.  Other parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were 
good.   
10/5 10:30, 11:30, 12:30	
10/6 8:00, 9:00-9:30, 10:30-11:00, 12:00	
The following were 49 high positive turbidity spikes (>50 NTU), some of these a 
continuous range, including one roll over episode (>1000 NTU), that were not 
consistent with the overall data record (range from 50-1341 NTU), mean of 242.92

November, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
Small zero and/or negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the 
following time span: 11/5 16:00-11/30 16:00 (logging period recorded 1,096 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
The following are shallow positive depth data (136 values with a range of 0.0 to 
0.098 m; mean of 0.038 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other 
parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted:
11/9 15:00-23:30
11/10 1:30-10:30, 14:30-21:30

11/15	0:00-18:30
11/16	16:00-16:30, 17:30
11/17	2:00-11:30
The following are shallow negative depth data (58 values with a range of -0.001 
to ­0.064 m; mean of -0.035 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as 
other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted.
11/15	20:00-23:30
11/16	0:00-15:30; 18:00-23:30
11/17	0:00-0:30
The following were several episodes of higher and lower than normal readings of 
dissolved oxygen and percent saturation.  These episodes were not deleted, as 
post calibration tests were accepted; and may have been a result of low winter 
temperatures and the monthly astronomical tides.
11/23 11:00-13:30 (range: 7.82/66.8 to 16.52 mg/l and 143.1%)
11/24 11:30-15:30 (range: 6.42/64.2 to 16.86 mg/l and 150.1%)
11/25 12:30-15:30 (range: 12.26/118.9 to 15.33 mg/l and 135.1%)
11/26 13:30-17:00 (range: 12.39/117.1 to 18.24 mg/l and 160.4%)
There was a continuous gradual increase of high dissolved oxygen and percent 
saturation readings from 11/27 1:30 through 11/31 23:30.  These high values 
began at approximately the low value range of 12.84 mg/l and 112.9% to a 
stabilized high value range of 17.03 mg/l and 125.1% (mean of 14.76 mg/l and 
118.83%).  These readings were not deleted, as post calibration tests were 
accepted; and these higher than normal values could have been a result of low 
winter temperatures.
No data collected on the following dates/times, due to a data gap:
11/30 23:00 - 23:30


Inlet:
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 11/17 5:30-11/20 9:00 (logging period recorded 16 anomalies), possibly due 
to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
There was a range of lower than normal dissolved oxygen and percent saturation 
from 11/27 13:30 through 11/29 0:00, during astronomical tides with several low 
tide fluctuations; that were not consistent with the overall data record (at 
high tide the readings returned to the consistency of the overall data record).  
These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these 
values are bad.

December, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
There was a continuous stabilized range of high dissolved oxygen and percent 
saturation readings from 12/1 0:00 through 12/17 9:30 (a continuation of the 
gradual increase of high dissolved oxygen and percent saturation readings from 
11/27 1:30 through 11/31 23:30).  These high continuous stabilized values had a 
range from 14.77/121.7 to 18.38 mg/l and 129.7% (mean of 16.66 mg/l and 
125.93%).  These readings were not deleted, as post calibration tests were 
accepted; and these higher than normal values could have been a result of low 
winter temperatures.
Small zero and/or negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the 
following time span: 12/2 11:00-12/31 23:00 (logging period recorded 1183 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 12/17 10:00 through 
12/31 23:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction.
No data collected on the following dates/times; due to a data gap.  Logger did 
not record data within this time range, possibly due to the cold temperatures.
12/28 1:30-2:00, 12:30, 23:30
12/29 0:00, 9:30

Inlet:
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 12/18 8:00-12/20 14:00 (logging period recorded 30 anomalies), possibly

No data collected from 9/1 0:00 through 9/30 23:30 due to a SECOND major battery 
crash (a continuation from the 8/24 6:00 crash), where battery voltage dropped 
quickly from 12.0 to 6.0 volts within approximately a 8 day span.  Possible 
causes of this crash (after conferring with YSI engineers) include static 
electricity from a car seat prior to deployment or a nearby lightning strike.

Inlet:
No missing data to report.

October, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No data collected from 10/1 0:00 through 10/31 23:30 due to a SECOND major 
battery crash (a continuation from the 8/24 6:00 crash), where battery voltage 
dropped quickly from 12.0 to 6.0 volts within approximately a 8 day span.  
Possible causes of this crash (after conferring with YSI engineers) include 
static electricity from a car seat prior to deployment or a nearby lightning 
strike.
Also, no data collected due to data sonde repairs and downtime for calibration 
and maintenance.

Inlet: 
No data from 10/26 12:00-10/31 23:30 due to downtime for calibration, maintenance and downloading.

November, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No data from 11/1 0:00 to 11/5 15:00 due to downtime for calibration, maintenance and downloading.
No data collected on the following dates/times, due to a data gap:
11/30 23:00 - 23:30

Inlet:
No data from 11/1 0:00 to 11/5 14:30 due to downtime for calibration, maintenance and downloading. 

December, 1999 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 12/17 10:00 through 
12/31 23:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe malfunction.
No data collected on the following dates/times; due to a data gap.
12/28 1:30-2:00, 12:30, 23:30
12/29 0:00, 9:30

Inlet:
No data from 12/17 10:30 to 16:00 due to downtime for calibration, maintenance and downloading.




12.  Other Remarks/Notes:

(IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN); where our telemetry unit is 
stationed, a new vented level YSI 6600 with its new vented level cable was 
deployed to collect its first data on 5/4/99 at 12:00.  The YSI telemetry unit 
began collecting its first data on 3/16/98 at 10:30:00 (see Section 4-Research 
Methods).  

(Note:  The Wells NERR two Drakes Island sites (see 1996-1997 metatdata) are 
currently being monitored (since 1996), but we are using the data for another 
project (CICEET-Wells Harbor dredge; see Section 7-Associated Researchers and 
Projects); and are not collecting the dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, and 
pH parameters.

(The use of the newest (Version 2.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 
System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water Quality 
Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in July 1999 when they became 
available.

(With our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the amount of time of missing 
data from calibrations and maintenance for all sites.  Some months have no 
missing data from the use of this extra sonde.

(Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
