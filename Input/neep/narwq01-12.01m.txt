2.	Entry verification:
Data are downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 or YSI Model 6600 sondes to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat) to a PC located at the reserve 
laboratory. Graphs are produced from the .dat files using the Eco-Watch 
application supplied by YSI and examined for obvious sensor failure, using the 
suggested data analysis protocol provided to the NERRS by YSI. A post-deployment 
check is run on the sondes to determine if there is significant sensor drift 
(>10%) due to biofouling. Fouling of sensors is detected by 1) visual inspection 
of the instrument, 2) post-deployment measurements taken using calibration 
standards, and 3) by comparing final measurements of a given deployment with 
initial measurements of the succeeding deployment.

Sea-truthing was conducted by measuring water quality parameters with a YSI 
Model 6920 (or YSI Model 6600) attached by cable to a hand-held data recorder 
(YSI 610-DM).  Values for temperature, salinity, DO mg/L, depth, pH, and time 
were recorded real-time for both surface and bottom measurements at each 
deployment site.  The preparation and post-deployment procedures for the data 
logger used in sea-truthing follows the same general procedure as that for data 
loggers used in deployments, and is the responsibility of the reserve 
technicians.


The comma-delimited files are imported into Excel 97 and a printed version is 
produced to aid in the QA/QC process. The file is processed using macros 
supplied by the CDMO which are designed to: 1) check data files for missing data 
points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods (.), 3) convert 
the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and numeric 
variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the sensors and 
out the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) save the files as Excel 
worksheets (*.xls).  The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to 
flag or delete the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside 
the range expected for the site (see Section 5, Site Location and Character), 2) 
outside the range of measurements and accuracy established for the sensors (Part 
II, Section 8: Variable Sequence, Range of Measurements, Units, Resolution, and 
Accuracy section), or 3) outside the range established for good water quality 
conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen <4 mg/L).  Data are deleted if the anomalies 
are attributed to: 1) a sensor malfunction, or 2) significant fouling of sensors 
by marine organisms.After appropriate corrections or deletions are made to the 
Excel worksheet (*.xls), the files are exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt).  
Patricia Richard and Robin Weber are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
YSI 6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve's (NERR) Water Quality 
Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop long-term data sets for 
representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over  
time. Because Prudence Island is located in the geographic center of 
Narragansett Bay, it is an ideal venue for monitoring hydrographic conditions 
and overall trends within that body of water. One NERR water quality monitoring 
station has been established at Potter's Cove, on the island's northeastern 
shore.  This area is impacted by boat traffic and storm runoff from mainland 
urban and residential areas. The second NERR water quality monitoring station, 
T-Wharf, is situated on the southeastern shore of the island, facing the open 
waters of Rhode Island Sound. It is approximately 6 miles south of the Potter's 
Cove site. Boat traffic is sparse at this site and storm runoff is less likely 
to have a significant impact there, so this station serves as our "control" 
site.  The Narragansett Bay water quality monitoring program began in December, 
1995 at Potter's Cove and in September, 1996 at T-Wharf. (see Section 5, Site 
Location and Character section for description of sites).  YSI electronic data 
loggers were deployed to measure the water temperature, specific conductance, 
dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity conditions, approximately 0.5 meters above 
the bottom, at 30-minute intervals. Change in water level was also recorded. 

4.	Research Methods
One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in Narragansett 
Bay. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on 
the season, and measurements are taken every 30 minutes. The monitoring station 
at Potter's Cove was constructed in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted 
vertically on a piling located approximately 6 feet west of a floating dock.  To 
facilitate water flow across the sensors, openings are cut into the PVC pipes.  
The pipes are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are less than 1 meter 
from the bottom.  In 1996, the T-Wharf station was put into service: the PVC 
pipe is mounted on a piling attached to a pier. At the end of the sampling 
period, the data loggers are retrieved and freshly cleaned and calibrated 
instruments are deployed. The retrieved data loggers are brought back to the 
laboratory, post deployment evaluations of the instrument are carried out, and 
the device is cleaned, calibrated, and serviced by methods outlined in the YSI 
Operating and Service Manual. After cleaning the data loggers, the pH, salinity, 
depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 
and 10, salinity standard of 30.36 ppt or specific conductivity standard of 
50.00 mS/cm, depth in the air, and turbidity standards of 0 and 100 NTU, 
respectively.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and allowed to 
stretch for a minimum of 24 hours before the DO sensor is calibrated in water-
saturated air. The sonde is programmed to begin taking measurements 
approximately 12 hours in advance of planned deployment, allowing the DO 
membrane to stabilize. The file is checked for DO sensor drift before the DO 
probe calibrated. Calibration of the dissolved oxygen sensor is usually done 
within 2 hours of deployment.

8.	Associated researchers and projects:
Dissolved Oxygen Survey - Under the direction of Dr. Christopher Deacutis, NAR 
NERR Research Coordinator, with volunteers from the R.I. Dept. of Environmental 
Management, Roger Williams University, the University of Rhode Island, Brown 
University, the Environmental Protection Agency offices in Narragansett, RI and 
Lexington, MA, the Massachusetts Coastal Zoning Management Agency, U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, the Narragansett Bay Commission, Save the Bay, Yellow Springs 
Instruments, and NBNERR staff. The goal of the survey is to take discrete 
samples within the water column (surface, bottom, and every 1.5 meters of depth) 
at more than 75 stations in the Narragansett Bay. These surveys are performed 
overnight during neap tide. The project began in 1999, and takes place at least 
twice during the summer. The data will be used to map dissolved oxygen levels 
bay-wide and help to identify sites at risk for hypoxic and anoxic events. 
Inquiries should be directed to Dr. Deacutis at the RIDEM, Dept. of Water 
Resources, 235 Promenade St., Providence RI 02908, tel. (401) 222-4700 x7270.

10.	Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions:
	PC= Potter's Cove	TW=T-Wharf

11. Data anomalies:

January 1-31, 2001 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
01/01/01 00:00:00 - 01/11/01 09:30:00 - Turbidity outliers continue to be 
problematic. Data were deleted because calibration error rendered values <-1.

01/11/01 09:30:00- 10:00:00 - Discontinuity between deployments. All within 
range except turbidity, but DO measurements come very close to exceeding 
acceptable standard for drift correction. An explanation could be that for the 
preceding deployment the dissolved oxygen sensor was not properly calibrated, 
according to the current S.O.P. The csv files indicate that the sensor was 
reading high prior to deployment 12/21/00 14:30:00 and continued reading high 
after retrieval 01/11/01 09:30:00. Data were retained.

01/11/01 10:00:00 - 01/31/01 23:30:00 - Measurements for pH appear slightly 
anomalous when taken in context with surrounding deployments. Discontinuity 
between successive deployments suggests that one of the pH probes may have been 
failing despite the fact that both were within range for mV and calibrated 
correctly. All pH data were retained.

01/15/01 01:00:00 - Data is inexplicably missing. The sonde must have reset 
itself, but no error message was logged.

Supersaturation measurements for dissolved oxygen (>120%) were noted for the 
following dates and times:
01/07/01 - 15:00:00, 16:00:00-17:30:00
01/08/01 - 17:30:00
01/10/01 - 15:00:00

T-Wharf
01/01/01 00:00:00-01/31/01 23:30:00 - Turbidity outliers continue to be 
problematic. All turbidity data are missing for the month of January, either 
because of calibration issues or because the sonde was not outfitted with a 
turbidity probe.

01/11/01 09:00:00-09:30:00 - Discontinuity between deployments All within range 
except temperature, which is off by .65. Drop in pH may be a result of 
temperature shock, values recover within a few hours. Data were retained.

01/11/01 09:30:00-02/01/01 13:00:00 - Time stamp was off by 40 seconds, 
corrected to read on the hour and half-hour.

01/28/01 02:30:00-03:00:00 - DO numbers suddenly drop by almost 30% - DO charge 
is down to 43, which is within range but still a big drop from previous reading. 
Numbers return to normal within the hour, but then take a dive of nearly 40% on 
01/28/01 08:00:00 Numbers remain on the low side until 01/29/01, after which 
they take a sudden jump upwards nearly 30%. I can think of no logical 
explanation for this other than perhaps an obstruction that eventually cleared 
itself or an organism respiring in the sonde guard. Data have been retained.

February 1-28, 2001 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
02/01/01 00:00:00 - 02/01/01 13:00:00 - Measurements for pH appear slightly 
anomalous when taken in context with surrounding deployments. Discontinuity 
between successive deployments suggests that one of the pH probes may have been 
failing despite the fact that both were within range for mV and calibrated 
correctly. All pH data were retained.

02/01/01 13:30:00 - 02/15/01 13:30:00 - Huge discontinuity at changeover and 
very high dissolved oxygen measurements for the entire deployment.  Pre-
deployment values for DO% were high which may account for the initial high 
readings.  Post-calibration readings approximated 100% which indicates that 
downward drift may have occurred during deployment. Data have been retained.

02/01/01 13:30:00 - 02/15/01 13:30:00 - Turbidity outliers continue to be 
problematic. Deleted turbidity data for deployment because numbers are <-1.

02/15/01 14:00:00 - 03/12/01 10:30:00 - Measurements for pH appear slightly 
anomalous when taken in context with surrounding deployments. Discontinuity 
between successive deployments suggests that one of the pH probes may have been 
failing despite the fact that both were within range for mV and calibrated 
correctly. All pH data were retained.

corrected to read on the hour and half-hour.

05/09/01 09:30:00-05/21/01 10:00:00 - No turbidity data because the unit was not 
outfitted with a turbidity probe.

05/30/01 13:00:00 - Data missing during sonde changeover.

Continuity between deployments was not very good for May deployment 5/21/01 
10:30:00. Pipe maintenance probably stirred up a lot of debris and oxygenated 
the water. DO data appears to return to normal within a half-hour, but salinity 
and pH never really recovers to prior levels. Data were retained.

Two turbidity spikes 05/27/01 01:00:00 (1173) and 05/27/01 06:00:00 (1097), 
probably anomalous. Crabs invaded the sonde guard and the turbidity probe failed 
mechanically upon retrieval. Data have been deleted.

05/30/01 13:30:00 through 05/31/01 23:30:00 - No turbidity data because sonde 
was not outfitted with turbidity probe.

06/8/01 13:30:00-06/15/01 13:00:00 - DO membrane puncture Data deleted.

6/14/01 11:30:00-6/15/01 13:00:00 - pH probe failure. Probe was cracked, 
probably by animal trapped in sonde guard. Data deleted.

06/15/01 13:30:00-06/25/01 10:30:00 - Time stamp is off by 40 seconds, corrected 
to read on the hour and half hour.

Low salinity values (<25ppt).  These values are the result of storm runoff from 
urban areas north of the cove. (6/17/01, 2.66" precipitation recorded by NWS

Supersaturation measurements for dissolved oxygen (>120 %) were noted on the 
following dates and times:

09/29/01	00:00:00-07:00:00

For the period 09/27/01-09/29/01, the supersaturation numbers noted were 
corroborated by discrete measurements taken for another project (Andrew Altieri 
of Brown University, NBNERR graduate research fellow) on 09/28/01 during 
daylight hours. Bay water was markedly discolored by what appeared to be 
phytoplankton. Numbers were further corroborated by a University of Rhode Island 
buoy just north of the Potter's Cove site (Dr. Dana Kester). We can safely 
assume that the supersaturation numbers taken during this period are reflective 
of a true event, very likely related to biological processes taking place in the 
bay. Also, please note that pH measurements were unusually high during this 
period.

9/11/01 - 15:30:00

T-Wharf:
Turbidity outliers (> 1000 NTU) for the following dates and times were removed 
from the data set.  These samples were inconsistent with other measurements and 
probably indictative of biofouling.
09/16/01 - 03:30:00

October 1-31, 2001 Sampling period
Potter's Cove:
10/03/01 19:00:00 - Turbidity spike (>50 NTU). Data point retained.

10/05/01 22:00:00-10/17/01 08:30:00 - DO membrane damage. Data deleted.

10/06/01 07:00:00 - Anomalous data point for salinity. Salinity measure drops to 
24.9 ppt, returns to normal within 1/2 hour. Data point along with SpCond was 
deleted.

Low dissolved oxygen (<4 mg/L and =/> 28%) measurements were noted on the 
following dates and times::
10/03/01 - 03:00:00-04:00:00, 08:00:00
10/04/01 - 04:00:00, 05:00:00

10/23/01 03:30:00 - 10/26/01 14:00:00 - Abrupt drop in DO mg/L 10/23/01 3:30:00. 
DO membrane damage is suspected, data have been deleted.

10/11/01 18:00:00-10/17/01 08:30:00 - pH probe failure. Data deleted.

T-Wharf:
10/08/01 - 5:30:00 Salinity inexplicably drops to 10.63 ppt, returning to normal 
at next reading. This is almost certainly transient matter occluding the probe, 
data points for SpCond and Salinity have been deleted.

Supersaturation values (DO > 120%) were noted for the following dates and times:
10/05/01 - 15:00:00-16:30:00, 17:30:00
10/12/01 - 15:00:00, 15:30:00, 23:00:00, 23:30:00
10/20/01 - 14:30:00, 15:00:00

09:00:00, 11:00:00-15:00:00, 16:00:00, 21:30:00, 22:30:00
10/24/01 - 13:00:00-14:00:00, 15:30:00-16:30:00, 18:30:00-22:30:00
10/25/01 - 10:00:00-14:30:00
It is advisable to regard the supersaturation numbers 10/21-10/25 with some 
suspicion, as there appears to be some sort of obstruction of the pipe during 
this period. However, no membrane damage occurred and continuity between 
deployments on 10/26 is good.

Between 10/14/01-10/26/01, depth measurements indicate that the sonde was 
somehow pushed toward the surface and became lodged in the pipe. Post retrieval 
data for the deployment ending 10/26 shows that depth sensor had drifted to some 
degree, but not enough to account for the peculiar readings. At the beginning of 
the subsequent deployment, depths were indicative of some obstruction that 
appears to have cleared early in the deployment. All the data were retained, but 
cannot be considered wholly reliable because water flow might have been 
restricted to some degree.

10/18/01 18:00:00 - Turbidity spiked to greater than 50 NTU

Turbidity outliers for October. Small negative and/or zero values, possibly the 
result of a calibration error.
10/26/01 - 15:30:00-16:30:00, 18:00:00-19:30:00, 21:00:00, 21:30:00, 22:30:00-
23:30:00

November 1-31, 2001 Sampling period:
Potter's Cove:
Turbidity spike greater than 100 NTU on the following date:
11/03/01 - 04:00:00 - Probably the result of an animal or other biological 
matter occluding the probe. Data retained.

11/04/01 06:00:00-11/05/01 09:30:00 - Abrupt change in DO charge indicates a 
problem. DO membrane failed integrity test at post-deployment calibration check. 
Data were deleted.

11/05/01 10:00:00-11/19/01 10:30:00 - Time stamp off by 20 seconds, corrected to 
read on the hour and half-hour.

Supersaturation levels of dissolved oxygen (> 120%) were noted for the following 
dates and times:
11/05/01 - 15:00:00-16:00:00
11/26/01 - 20:30:00
11/27/01 - 16:30:00
11/28/01 - 18:30:00

T-Wharf:
11/05/01 09:30:00-11/19/01 10:00:00 - Time stamp is off by 20 seconds, corrected 
to read on the hour and half hour.

11/05/01 09:30:00-11/20/01 10:00:00 - Continuity for this deployment is poor, 
possibly because the unit was lodged in the pipe. Depth continuity is off by 
more than 1 meter, and chances are good that circulation in the pipe was poor. 
However, the obstruction did clear itself after 2 tidal cycles (by 11/06/01 
15:30:00) and the rest of the deployment seems fine. All data have been 
retained.

Turbidity spike of greater than 50 NTU occurred on the following date and time:
11/17/01 11:00:00 - This is most likely caused by transient organic matter on or 
near the sensor, and should be considered an anomalous reading.

December 1-31, 2001 Sampling period
Potter's Cove:
Data missing on the following dates and times is the result of battery failure:
12/24/01 10:00:00-19:30:00, 21:00:00- 22:30:00
12/25/01 02:00:00-08:00:00
12/25/01 14:30:00-12/31/01 23:30:00

T-Wharf:
12/04/01 10:30:00-12/19/01 10:00:00 - Time stamp was off by 19 seconds, 
corrected to read on the hour and half hour. 

Data missing probably as a result of low battery voltage on the following dates 
and times:
12/19/01 09:00:00
12/29/01 22:00:00
12/30/01 00:00:00, 11:30:00-19:00:00
12/30/01 23:00:00-23:30:00
12/31/01 00:00:00-23:30:00

12. 	Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. 	Other Remarks/Notes
a) Throughout the summer months, the issue of biofouling seems to play a major 
role in the wide disparity of measurements. Even though sea truthing and post 
calibration records lend certain credibility to the data, there are a number of 
measurements in the data set that should be regarded with suspicion, 
particularly those where readings change drastically over a short period of 
time. This data continues to be reviewed at the collection site, and it is 
likely that many anomalous data points will be deleted during this ongoing 
process. The Potter's Cove site seemed to be particularly affected by biofouling 
issues this year, possibly owing to conditions within the deployment structure.

b) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them. 

c) There was a great amount of discontinuity between deployments for pH. In 
general, the same two sondes are successively switched out at individual sites.  
The pH probes seem to be in disagreement (one reading higher, one lower) at PC 
for January through April and at TW beginning July through the end of the year.  
The pattern of this disagreement becomes obvious only when data for the entire 
year is viewed. Since there is no means to determine which of the probes was 
functioning properly at the time of data collection (both pH probes being within 
range and calibrating correctly), the data were all retained.  Some correction 
of the data may be required as the variation in pH throughout the year is partly 
artificial.
