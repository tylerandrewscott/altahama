2.  Entry Verification:
The data is directly downloaded in a spreadsheet format from the YSI 6000 upg 
datalogger to a PC.  Edited files are created by removing the headers, footers, 
and spaces on a PC.  Missing data from YSI 6000 maintenance (downtime) is 
inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Data and graphs 
are visually inspected to find possible anomalies.  Edited and raw files are 
currently stored on 3.5-inch diskettes.  [Edited and raw data will be archived 
and stored on IBM 41T workstation].  Data files were QA/QCâd using Excel 5.0 
CDMO macros.  Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited 
and merged monthly files are also transferred to NERRS Central Data Management 
Office.  James Hewes and Lonnie Dye are responsible for the editing and 
archiving of these data.

3.  Research Objectives:
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over two week periods at two sites in 
the St. Jones River component and one site in the Blackbird Creek component of 
Delaware's National Estuarine Research Reserve.  The St. Jones River is impacted 
by urbanization upstream and extensive agricultural activity throughout the 
basin.  The Blackbird Creek is one of the least impacted riverine systems in 
Delaware.

4.  Research Methods:
The YSI 6000 datalogger monitoring program was started in July 1995 at Scotton 
Landing (St. Jones River) and Blackbird Landing (Blackbird Creek).  In June 1996 
Penrose Branch (St. Jones River Basin) was added to the monitoring program.  
Prior to deployment, a 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC pipe was mounted to a piling 
at Scotton Landing and a bridge at Blackbird Landing and Penrose Branch using 
stainless steel brackets and bolts.  Each YSI 6000 is lowered into the PVC pipe 
that has eight (8) two-inch diameter holes cut out at the bottom for the probes 
to have direct contact with the water column.  A large stainless steel bolt was 
placed at the bottom end of the PVC pipe which maintained each YSI 6000 at each 
site exactly one foot (30 cm) above the river bottom.  Every half-hour over a 
two-week period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, water level and turbidity are 
recorded.  Seven days after the deployment of each YSI 6000, the dissolved 
oxygen membrane is cleaned with a Kimwipe dipped in methanol.  Two-week sampling 
intervals were selected due to limitations created by the dissolved oxygen 
membrane. At the end of each two-week period, the YSI 6000 is brought back to 
the office for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Calibrations performed 
include: dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity using Oakton 12,880 uS 
standard, turbidity using AMCO AEPO-1 Standard at 100 NTU and distilled water, 
pH using Fisher pH 4.00, 7.00 and 10.00 buffers, and depth.  These procedures 
are carried out according to the methods as described in the YSI Model 6000 
Operating and Service Manual.  After approximately six hours of down time for 
cleaning and recalibration, the YSI 6000's are redeployed for another two-week 
period. Data files are QA/QCâd using Excel 5.0 CDMO macros.  Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged monthly files are 
also transferred to NERRS Central Data Management Office.

5.  Site location and character:
The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component 
sites, the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are 
located along the Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located 
in central Kent County Delaware, east of the State Capitol City, Dover.  The 
Blackbird Creek component is located in the unincorporated area of Southern New 
Castle County.  There are three sampling sites, two located in St. Jones 
component and one in the Blackbird Creek component.
1) Scotton Landing - is located in the Lower St. Jones River at the Scotton 
Landing Public Fishing Pier, just up stream of Delaware Route 113.  The site is 
influenced by freshwater runoff from the relatively urbanized area upstream.  
Salinity ranges from 8 - 30 ppt.
             	Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) ö 1.26
		       Neap Mean (m) ö 1.13
Position:  Latitude     39 degree 05'  05.9160"  N
                              Longitude  75 degree 27'  38.1049"  W
2) Blackbird Landing - is located in the upper Blackbird Creek at Blackbird 
Landing Road.  The site is influenced by freshwater runoff from unimpacted 
forested areas intermixed with agricultural land uses and a small amount of low-
density development.  Salinity ranges from 2-7 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) ö 1.12
		       Neap Mean (m) ö 1.13
            	Position:  Latitude      39 degree 23'  19.5196"  N
		  Longitude   75 degree 38'  09.5882"  W
3) Penrose Branch - is located in the headwaters of the St. Jones Basin, north 
of Dover and along Pearsons Corner Road.  The site is predominately a forested 
wetland tributary system with agricultural land uses along the subcatchments 
fringe.  Salinity is 0.00 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Not Applicable, freshwater 
	Position:	Latitude      39 degree 09'  52.77"  N
		Longitude   75 degree 39'  01.52"  W

6.  Data collection period:
Scotton Landing data collection began on July 1, 1995.  Blackbird Landing data 
collection began on July 14, 1995. Penrose Branch data collection began on June 
1,1996.  All sampling is ongoing.

7.  Associated researchers and projects: 
An extensive stormwater sampling and hydrodynamic modeling project is underway 
in the upper reaches of the St. Jones River Basin.  This project includes flow 
weighted stormwater sampling to quantify pollutant loads from each of the major 
land uses found in the Basin.An additional stormwater sampling program is 
underway to analyze the impact of agricultural BMP's at sites in the Blackbird 
Creek Watershed, St. Jones River Watershed.A joint effort underway through 
NOAA's Center for Coastal Ecosystem Health and the DNERR characterization 
studies will initiate detailed monthly water quality sampling at three sites in 
each river over a two year period and will quantify the phytoplankton community 
with collections from the same sites.   This project was scheduled to be 
initiated in February 1995.(See Section I.1. for research contacts.)

section); pH also spiked at this time possibly due to the many leaves in the 
cage when the unit was pulled on 3/11.  
i) Depth (m) value on March 14, 1998 at 14:00:00 out of range, -3.29, value
