2.	Entry verification
	The data are downloaded from the YSI 6000s or 6600s to an IBM compatible 
PC.  Graphs of all data are printed using Ecowatch software and are examined for 
suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  Files are converted to Macintosh Excel 
files and edited for transfer to the NERRS CDMO.  Files are merged to contain 
one full month of data.  Missing data (from maintenance and downloading down 
time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by a period (.).  
Suspect data are deleted and replaced by periods (.).  After formatting 
the data, some files are more closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro®.  
Edited and raw files are archived on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR.   
No CDMO Excel 5.0 macros were used.  This process of entry verification was 
completed by Robin Cottrell, Daniel Hahn, and Douglas Bulthuis for the 1999 
data.  Final verification and this metadata documentation were completed by 
Douglas Bulthuis.

3.	Research Objectives
	The Bay View Channel site has been set out to detect and monitor short 
term variability and long-term changes in Padilla Bay.  The Joe Leary Slough 
site has been set at the mouth of the slough to measure the effects of tidal 
"closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough and to detect long-term 
changes in water quality in the slough associated with implementation of a non 
point source pollution watershed action plan.  Measurements are taken every 30 
minutes at both sites unless otherwise noted in data anomalies.

4.	Research methods
	A YSI 6000 or 6600 were deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical 
position, 0.25 m above the bottom of the slough, in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe 
which has holes and slits drilled in it to allow water circulation around the 
probes.  The PVC pipe is attached to a steel pipe which was driven into the 
sediment.  Some dissolved oxygen data from Joe Leary Slough were anomalous and 
could be explained if there were poor exchange between the water inside the 
deployment tube and water outside the deployment tube.  Therefore during four 
days in October 1998 and 10 days in December 1998, YSI datasondes were deployed 
inside and outside the deployment tube simultaneously at the same depth.  All 
data were very similar inside and outside the deployment tube (or fluctuated in 
parallel indicating differences in calibration) during October and December with 
the exception of the dissolved oxygen data during October.  During four tidal 
cycles in October 1998, the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the deployment 
tube did not increase with increasing salinity as much as dissolved oxygen in 
the water outside the deployment tube.  (In Joe Leary Slough, salinity values 
typically fluctuate from 0 to 10, 20 or even 30 PSU with each tidal cycle, 
with higher oxygen concentrations usually observed in the high salinity water.)  
The October dissolved oxygen data could indicate that organic material with a 
high oxygen demand may have accumulated inside the deployment tube and/or 
epiphytic and bacterial growth along the openings in the deployment tube may be 
exerting a high oxygen demand on the water in the tube.  If exchange between the 
water inside and outside the pipe were slow enough, the material and organisms 
inside the tube could exert a measurable decrease in dissolved oxygen.  When the 
same experiment was repeated in December 1998, there was no difference in 
dissolved oxygen inside and outside the deployment tube.  Therefore, dissolved 
oxygen data from Joe Leary Slough need to be interpreted with caution because 
there may be times when the data indicate dissolved oxygen concentrations inside 
the deployment tube that are different than concentrations in Joe Leary Slough 
outside the deployment tube.

	A YSI 6000 or 6600 were deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview 
Channel.  They were deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, 
except that the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes.   The depth of the YSI 
was -1.1 m (depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the 
sloping edge of a small channel draining the surrounding intertidal flats. 

	In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth, pH and turbidity are 
recorded every half-hour.  At the end of each sampling period, the YSI 6000 or 
6600 is brought back into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and 
recalibration.   All standards were purchased from scientific supply houses. 

	All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 6000 
Operation and Service Manual.  For the conductivity calibration a conductivity 
standard of 50 mS/cm was used.  The pH calibration is a 2-point calibration 
using standard pH buffer solutions with a pH of 7 and 10.  The KCl solution and 
Teflon membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6000 
or 6600 deployment and the new oxygen membrane is allowed to soak overnight in 
water before calibration.
	
5.	Site location and character
	General Padilla Bay (48° 30' N; 122° 30' W) is a shallow embayment in 
northern Puget Sound.  The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera 
marina, which covers approximately 3,000 ha.  Zostera japonica, a recent invader 
to the region, now covers about 350 ha of the bay.  Tides are mixed semi-diurnal 
with a mean range of 1.55 m.  Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU.

	Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer 
empties directly into it.  Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed 
is agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay.  The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located.  
Major freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary 
come from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River 
to the south.

	Joe Leary Slough Site  (48° 31' 05.3" N; 122° 28' 22.8" W) Joe Leary 
Slough drains land that is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture 
land with some low density housing.  The slough is characterized by high fecal 
and nutrient inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  
During the summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m.  
During winter flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m.   There is a dam at 
the mouth of the slough with twelve 4 ft diameter outfall pipes that have one-
way hinged  tide gates.   Saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through the tide 
gates during high tide.  The bottom of the slough is composed of very soft 
sediment, which is periodically dredged.  A YSI 6000 (or 6600) is deployed on 
the freshwater side of the tide gates at a depth of about 0.25 m above the 
bottom.  The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and 
differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated 
accuracy of ± 5m.

	Bayview Channel Site  (48° 29' 46.6" N; 122° 30' 01.8" W) Bayview Channel, 
a major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macro-vegetation.  
The YSI 6000 (or 6600) is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel.  
The tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) 
covered intertidal flats.  Bottom sediments beneath the 
YSI 6000 are fine silt and clay overlying sand.   The YSI 6000 is deployed in a 
black PVC pipe that is attached to two steel pipes set in the sediment.  When 
deployed, the datasonde is located about 0.75 m above the bottom.  During 1999 
the datasonde became "stuck" inside the black PVC pipe becuase of fouling, 
particularly by barnacles.  On September 23, 1999, the black PVC pipe was 
replaced with a new pipe and attached at the same location and height.  
Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point source, agricultural non-
point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from agriculture, failing septic tanks 
and wildlife.  The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer 
II and differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's 
stated accuracy of ± 5m.

6.	Data collection period
	Data collection was continuous from January 1 to December 31 at both sites 
except for times of downloading, cleaning and recalibration as noted in the 
missing data section.
	 
	Deployment and retrieval times at the Joe Leary Slough site and the Bay 
View Channel site are listed below.  The times indicate the first and last 
measurements made with each deployment.

*During 1997 records were kept of the atmospheric pressure during calibration of 
depth and the apparent depth after each two to four week deployment.  The data 
indicated that depth readings could read as much as 0.28 m above or below true 
depth.  Therefore, although the sensor may accurately read ± 0.001 m, changes in 
atmospheric pressure when deployed indicate depth may be ± 0.3 m.

10.	Data anomalies
January 1999
JL:   Turbidity values over 1000 were recorded on 2, 3, & 4 Jan, the cause is 
unknown but these values were associated with peak freshwater flows out of Joe 
Leary Slough.

The pH readings are somewhat erratic with isolated low readings associated with 
influx of high saline water.  An erratic turbidity value over 1000 was recorded 
at 2030 on 26 Jan and removed from the database (the cause is not known.)
BY:   High and erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and 
removed from the database:  0430 & 0530 on 9 Jan, 0730 & 1430 on 10 Jan, 0600 on 
13 Jan, 2130 on 27 Jan, and 0700 on 30 Jan.  No DO because membrane was 
punctured for the entire month.  

February 1999
JL:    High and erratic turbidity values were recorded from 1900 on 15 Feb  
through 1300 on 17 Feb and removed from the database, the causes for these high 
erratic values is not known but could be caused by vegetative debris caught in 
the guard around the probes.
BY:   High and erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and 
removed from the database:  1300 on 6 Feb, 2200 on 12 Feb, 0230 & 1300-1330 
on 20 Feb, 1730 on 24 Feb and 1730 on 25 Feb. No dissolved oxygen data from 0000 
1 Feb through 0930 17 Feb because the oxygen membrane was punctured.

March 1999
JL:    High (over 1000) and erratic turbidity values were recorded at the 
following times and removed from the database (the cause(s) are not known):  
0000 on 18 Mar, 2330 on 18 Mar, 1330 on 22 Mar, 1400-1430 on 23 Mar, 1530 on 24 
Mar, 2200 on 26 May, and 1700 on 27 Mar.
BY:   High and erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and 
removed from the database (the cause(s) are not known):  0930 on 1 Mar,  0600 
on 2 Mar, 2130 on 4 Mar, 0900 on 10 Mar, 1500 on 11 Mar, 0800 on 12 Mar, 
1100 on 18 Mar, 1800 on 26 Mar, 2300 on 27 Mar, and 1300 on 31 Mar.  Erratic 
low dissolved oxygen data were recorded at the following times, the cause(s)  
are unknown, and the data removed from the database:  1700 on 7 Mar, 0030 
on 26 Mar, and 0130 on 27 Mar.

April 1999
JL:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0700 on 24 Apr through 1230 on 28 Apr were 
erratic and low toward the end of the deployment period, the cause is unknown 
but may be related to the debris that was found caught in the guard at the end 
of the deployment, the data were deleted.   High and erratic turbidity values 
were recorded from 1000 on 3 Apr to 1200 on 7 Apr and from 1930 on 14 Apr to 
1230 on 28 Apr and removed from the database (the cause(s) are not known) but 
may have been caused by the debris that was found caught in the guard at the end 
of the deployment.)  High, isolated, and erratic turbidity values  (cause 
unknown) were recorded at the following times and removed from the database:   
1100 on 1 Apr, 2330 on 1 Apr, 1700 on 2 Apr, 1800 on 11 Apr, and 0900 on 29 Apr.  
Negative depths were recorded at 1300 & 1330 on 30 April.
BY:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 on 1 Apr through 0930 on 20 Apr should be 
interpreted with caution because the sonde may have been recording values 
lower than actual; the surface of the oxygen probe tip was tarnished on 
retrieval on 20 Apr; the probe read 88.5 % in water saturated air.  High and 
erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and removed 
from the database (the cause(s) are not known):  0800 on 3 Apr, 1830 on 4 Apr, 
0330 on 5 Apr, 1900 on 14 Apr, 1900 on 23 Apr, and 0200-0230 on 25 Apr.

May 1999
JL:    No dissolved oxygen or turbidity data from 1330 on 6 May to 1230 on 19  
May because the dissolved oxygen dropped precipitously to very low 
concentrations from over 100% saturation and remained low for the rest of the 
deployment at the same time as turbidity was erratic, high, and over 1000 NTU 
most of the time; a lot of debris was found in the guard at the end of the 
deployment.  Dissolved oxygen saturation dropped to near 0 from 1600 to 1830 on 
5 May, cause unknown, data deleted from the database.  Spurious, erratic, and 
high turbidity values  (cause unknown) were recorded at the following times and 
were removed from the  database:  1900 on 5 May, 0600 & 1100 on 24 May, 0800 
on 25 May, and 2030 on 27 May.  Negative depths were recorded at the 
following times:  1200-1400 on 1 May, 1130-1530 on 2 May, 1200-1530 on 3 
May, 1400-1700 on 6 May, 1300 on 14 May, 1430-1500 on 16 May, 1230-1600 
on 17 May, and 1530-1630 on 18 May.
BY:    Dissolved oxygen data from 1000-1100 on 10 May should be interpreted with 
caution because the data appear suspiciously low, no potential causes are 
known, the data were not removed.  Erratic low dissolved oxygen data at 0630 
on 22 May and 0300 on 23 May were removed from the database, the cause is 
not known.  A high and erratic turbidity value was recorded 1100 on 27 May 
and removed from the database (the cause is not known.)

June 1999
JL:   No turbidity data from 1330 on 1 Jun to 1100 on 16 Jun because data were 
deleted because the wiper on the probe was not working properly and the data 
were erratic.
BY:   A high and erratic turbidity value was recorded 2030 on 19 Jun and removed 
from the database (the cause is not known.)

July 1999
JL:   Spurious, erratic, and high turbidity values  (cause unknown) were 
recorded at the following times and were removed from the database:   0900 on 1 
Jul and 2030 on 17 Jul.
BY:   High and erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and 
removed from the database (the cause(s) are not known):  1930 & 2200 on 2 July 
and 0000 on 15 July.

August 1999
JL:   Negative depth recorded at 1130 on 23 Aug.  Dissolved oxygen from 16 Aug 
to 1200 on 26 Aug shows some decrease, cause unknown but could be failing 
membrane, although on retrieval of the datasonde the dissolved oxygen probe 
read 92.4% satuation in water saturated air.  Spurious, erratic, and high 
turbidity values  (cause unknown) were recorded at the following times and 
were removed from the  database:   0030, 0500, and 0700 on 2 Aug, 1500 on 4 
Aug, and 0500 on 9 Aug.
BY:   

September 1999
JL:   Negative depths were recorded 0830-0900 on 4 Sep and 0800-1100 on 5 Sep.  
From 1430 on 9 Sep to 1330 on 20 Sep the times that the probes were read and 
the data recorded  were 40 seconds past the hour and half hour; the cause for 
this anomaly is not known.  Spurious, erratic, and high turbidity values  
(cause unknown) were recorded at the following times and were removed from 
the  database:   2100 on 10 Sep, 1000 on 16 Sep, and 0830, 0930, and 1200 on 22 
Sep.
BY:   High turbidities (up to 150 NTU) were recorded on Sep 24 and 25.  These 
high turbidities were associated with high winds and heavy rains.  High and 
erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and removed from 
the database (the cause(s) are not known): 2000 on 3 Sep, 1230 on 25 Sep, and 
0600 on 26 Sep.

October 1999
JL:    The dissolved oxygen should be interpreted with caution from 1600 on 21 
Oct to 2330 on 31 Oct because at the end of the deployment (on Nov 9) there was 
a scummy layer on the membrane and the read 80.5% saturation in water 
saturated air.  From 1400 on 11 Oct to 0900 on 20 Oct the times that the probes 
were read and the data recorded  were 40 seconds past the hour and half hour; 
the cause for this anomaly is not known.  Negative depths were recorded at the 
following times:  0930-1000 on 22 Oct, 2330 on 23 Oct, 0000 and 2230-2330 on 
24 Oct, 0000-0300 on 25 Oct, 0030-0330 on 26 Oct, 0000-1030 and 2230-2330 on 
27 Oct, 0000-1030 on 28 Oct, 0330-0600 on 29 )ct, 0300-0800 on 30 Oct, and 
0430-0630 on 31 Oct.
BY:    Dissolved oxygen data from 1300 on 19 Oct through 2330 on 31 Oct should 
be interpreted with caution; the data seem reasonable but the dissolved oxygen 
probe failed at 1800 on 7 Nov for no apparent reason.  High and erratic 
turbidity values were recorded at the following times and removed from the 
database (the cause(s) are not known):   2330 on 6 Oct, 0400 on 8 Oct, 1400 on 
16 Oct, and 1300 on 18 Oct.

November 1999
JL:  No pH data from 1500 on 9 Nov to 2330 on 30 Nov because the probe was 
broken.  The dissolved oxygen should be interpreted with caution from 0000 on 1 
Nov to 1400 on 9 Nov because at the end of the deployment (on Nov 9) there was a 
scummy layer on the membrane and the read 80.5% saturation in water 
saturated air.  From 1500 on 9 Nov to 2330 on 30 Nov the times that the probes 
were read and the data recorded  were 40 seconds past the hour and half hour; 
the cause for this anomaly is not known.  Negative depths were recorded at the  
following times:  0600-0900 on 2 Nov, 0630-0930 on 3 Nov, 2230-2300 on 4 
Nov, 2130-2330 on 5 Nov, 0000-0100 and 2200-2330 on 6 Nov, 0000-0200 and 
2200-2330 on 7 Nov, 0000-0330 and 2300-2330 on 8 Nov, and 0000-0300 on 9 
Nov.   Spurious, erratic, and high turbidity values  (cause unknown) were 
recorded at the following times and were removed from the  database:   0130 on 
10 Nov, 0030 and 0230 on 13 Nov, 0430, 1030, and 1900 on 22 Nov, 0500 on 23 
Nov, 2230 on 24 Nov, and 0830 on 27 Nov.  Turbidity values from 2330 on 29 
Nov to 2330 on 30 Nov were erratic , high and low and  were deleted from the 
database; the cause is unknown.
BY:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 on 1 Nov through 1730 on 7 Nov should be 
interpreted with caution;  the data seem reasonable but the dissolved oxygen 
probe failed at 1800 on 7 Nov for no apparent reason.  High and erratic 
turbidity values were recorded at the following times and removed from the 
database (the cause(s) are not known):  1930 on 7 Nov and 0030 on 11 Nov. No 
dissolved oxygen from 1800 on 7 Nov to 2330 on 30 Nov because the dissolved 
oxygen probe failed for unknown reasons.  No turbidity data from 0130 on 11 Nov 
to 2330 on 30 Nov because the turbidity probe failed at 0130 on 11 Nov for 
unknown reasons.

December 1999
JL:    From 0000 on 1 Dec to 1100 on 6 Dec the times that the probes were read 
and the data recorded were 40 seconds past the hour and half hour; the cause for 
this anomaly is not known. No pH data from 0000 on 1 Dec to 1100 on 6 Dec 
because the probe was broken.  Spurious, erratic, and high turbidity values  
(cause unknown) were recorded at the following times and were removed from 
the  database:   1700 on 1 Dec and 1830 on 4 Dec.  Turbidity from 0000 on 1 Dec 
to 1100 on 6 Dec should be interpreted with caution, most of the values seem 
reasonable but these data were recorded after 24 hours of high erratic data on 
30 Nov; at the end of the deployment (Dec 6) the turbidity probe read 100.9 in 
100 NTU standard.  Dissolved oxygen data from 0400 to 1300 on 16 December 
decreased sharply and then returned to previous values.  The cause is unknown 
although very high turbidity values were recorded at the time; the dissolved 
oxygen data during this time should be interpreted with caution. Turbidity from 
12 Dec to 28 Dec included many high anomalous values and many over 1000 so the 
data are suspect and should be interpreted with caution; however, many of these 
values were associated with a rain event and the data were left in the database.
