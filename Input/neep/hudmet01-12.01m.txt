2. Entry verification
 	
Person responsible for data verification: Erik Bedan, Research Assistant

a)  Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  
The CDMO Datalogger Program (hud30.csi) was loaded into the CR10X, which 
controls the sensors and the data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  For data storage, the 
CR10X stored the data, via cable, on a Campbell Scientific SM 192 storage 
module.  The storage module was manually retrieved at the end of every month.  
Using the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific, the data were 
downloaded from the storage module and stored on computer.  All raw data files 
were archived at the CDMO and at the reserve on ditto tapes, and CD-ROM.  
Anomalous or missing data were either deleted or identified in sections 11 & 12.

When the entire month of data were stored on computer, the CDMO Weather 
Data Management Program (WDMP) was used to convert the data into an Access 
database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the 
NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the 
data collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the 
monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  There were three main tasks 
completed by the WDMP.  First, it converted the comma delimited monthly raw data 
file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checked the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it 
produced error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data were investigated and 
were noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were 
performed were noted in the Data Correction section below.  Most common errors 
from monthly reports were wind speeds below the 0.5m/s criteria.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3. Research objectives:

The objective of this study is to monitor the meteorological conditions at the 
Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve.  
Measurements are taken all year long at one location in accordance with section 
2b of the Entry Verification section.  A water quality-monitoring program has 
been ongoing for ten years at this component site, and the meteorological data 
will help provide ancillary data to that program.  In turn, this will help us to 
better understand the relationships between the atmospheric and aquatic 
environments at this site.

4. Research methods:

For data collection, the CR10X datalogger is programmed at intervals that are in 
accordance with section 2b of the Entry Verification section.  Data are 
retrieved and stored from the datalogger via the Campbell Scientific storage 
module at the end of each month.  The data are analyzed using only the Weather 
Data Management Program (WDMP).  The program creates a database and error report 
for each month of raw data.   The error reports are used to aid in the QA/QC of 
the data, along with the guidelines in section 2c.  Any errors are reported and 
corrected (if necessary) in sections 11 & 12.  For routine maintenance, 
sensors are investigated at least once a week to ensure there is no damage or 
blockage to the sensors.  According to Campbell Scientific, for proper data 
collection, sensors are to be calibrated every two 2 years.  After that time, 
the sensors are removed from the tower, and shipped to their respective 
manufacturer.  Calibration methods are performed by the manufacturers for proper 
and professional calibration.  In order to avoid missing data, a second set of 
sensors will be calibrated and available to be installed on the tower to 
continue data collection.

5. Site location and character:

The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a 
multicomponent site composed of approximately 5,000 acres of tidal wetland, open 
water, and adjacent upland buffer habitat.  The four component sites of the 
Reserve are located on the Hudson River in New York State by river miles (RM) 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan.  These include: Stockport 
Flats (RM 124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W), Columbia County; Tivoli Bays (RM 
98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), Dutchess County; and Iona Island (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 
73o58'45"W) and Piermont Marsh (RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W),Rockland County.  
These four components are located along 100 river miles of the Hudson River and 
are representative of the diverse plant and animal communities that occupy the 
salinity gradient within the Hudson estuary.  Development within the watersheds 
of Hudson River NERR component sites ranges from predominantly urban/suburban to 
forested/agricultural.  

The weather station where the data is collected is located at the Tivoli Bays 
component site with a position of 4652363.868N 589163.567W.  The main office 
for the Hudson River NERR is at the same site. Outside the office building is a 
24'x 18' wood deck, 9 feet off the ground, on the west side of the building. 
The weather station tower is affixed to this deck with the sensors atop a 30' 
tower, except for the following.  A heated rain gauge is attached to the  
building, next to the tower, 7 feet up from deck.  The temperature/barometer 
sensor is next to the tower, attached to the railing, 3 feet up from the deck.  
Although trees surround the area,  the tree line begins approximately 60 feet 
from the tower in most directions and the sensors are not shaded.  It is not 
yet known if there is any wind blockage from the trees because both tower and 
trees are at similar heights.  The tower is approximately 1.2 miles Southeast 
of the TS water quality monitoring station, 2.3 miles Southeast of the TN water 
quality monitoring station, and 0.2 miles Northwest of the SK water quality 
monitoring station.

6. Data collection period:

The first data were recorded on January 10, 2001 at 15:15 hours EST, and ended 
on December 31, 2001 at 2400 hours EST.

January 2001

Anomalous criteria for wind speed (i.e. "wind speed is less than 0.5m/s") were 
listed many times in the WDMP error report for this month as possible errors.  
We are certain the sensor was operating properly, most likely there was simply 
no wind.  The data were left in.  

Hourly and daily data were deleted on day 16 due to maintenance on the station which 
results in 5 second data loss.

This error is possible because the "1 hour data" is averaged from 5-second 
readings taken during that hour while the "15 minute data" (in this case the 15 
minute minimum) is not averaged, and only recorded at 15-minute intervals.  
Given the situation, these data can be very different.  The data were left in.

have improper dates and times for the month. One explanation maybe that the 
datalogger lost power, and reset all memory when power was re-established.

At this site, wintery weather requires us to utilize a heating tipping bucket 
for precipitation data. The heater may not have been functioning this month, 
precipitation data are suspect.

13. Other Remarks/notes:

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

Please note, monthly totals are not available in months where there was missing data.
