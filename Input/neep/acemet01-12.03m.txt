2.	Entry Verification
a)	Data Input Procedures:
The 15-minute, 1-hour average and 24-hour meteorological data recorded by each sensor 
are stored in a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program 
(nerr30.csi) that is loaded into the datalogger controls the sensors and data collections 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The 
CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.
	
The PC208W software is installed on a laptop computer.  This computer is used to 
download the weather data from the datalogger via a SC32A interface.  This data are saved 
in a text file (*.DAT). 

Once an entire month of data is collected, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) is used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERR Meteorological Data Collection 
Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The 
WDMP inputs and converts the monthly raw data file into the database, as described below.
First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access database.  
Next, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Appendix G for the 
CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data Criteria).  Finally, it 
produces error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data are investigated and noted in the 
Anomalous Data/Data Corrections Section.  Any data corrections that are performed are 
noted in the Anomalous Data/Data Correction Section below. 
	
Beginning November 12 @ 14:00, when the NERR4.CSI program (version 4 of the datalogger 
program) was loaded into the CR10X datalogger the data were processed as follows.Data are
uploaded from the CR10X data logger or storage module to a Personal Computer (IBM compatible).
Files are exported from PC208W or LoggerNet in a comma-delimited format (.DAT) and opened in 
Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro that was developed by the CDMO to 
reformat the header columns, insert station codes, insert a date column (mm/dd/yyyy), correct 
the time column format and reformat the data to the appropriate number of decimal places. 
The pre-processed file is then ready to be copied into the EQWin weather.eqi file where the data
are QA/QC checked and archived in a database.  EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used 
to discover data set outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is 
designed to measure) and large changes in the data. EQWin is also used to generate statistics,
view graphs, create customized queries and reports of the data, cross query the water, 
weather and nutrient data and finally export the data to the CDMO. 
	
Common error noted in the monthly error reports was missing data, which was caused by 
a faulty solar panel regulator and lead acid battery. 
Saundra Upchurch and Amy Whitaker Dukes are responsible for these tasks.

Gemteck's EQwin version 5 and the CDMO developed Microsoft Excel EQWinFormat.xls macro now replaces 
the WDMP as the NERR MET database management program and primary QA/QC program.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

For data collection, the CR10X datalogger was programmed to collect data in the 
following formats:
i)	15-minute data are collected instantaneously for Air Temperature (C), 
Relative Humidity (%), Barometric Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and 
Wind Direction (degrees).  15-minute Precipitation (mm) and PAR 
(mmol/m^2) data are totaled from 5-second readings, prior to NERR_4.CSI

ii)	15-minute average, maximum and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb) and Wind Speed (m/s) with NERR_4.CSI.

iii)	Hourly average, maximum, and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Hourly 
totals for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute 
readings.

iv)	Daily average, maximum and minumum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Daily totals 
for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute readings.

Data were stored on a Campbell Scientific storage module (SM192 or SM4M), which 
was retrieved monthly.  The data were downloaded and pre-processed as described in 
Section 2.  QA/QC of the data was conducted using either the WDMP or EQWin.  
WDMP error reports and EQWin queries were based on the following anomalous data 
criteria:

Air Temp:

3.	Research objectives (Campbell Weather Station):
The principal objective of the Weather Monitoring Program is to record long-term 
meteorological data for the ACE Basin in order to observe any environmental changes or 
trends over time.  

4.	Research Methods
The Campbell Scientific weather station measures the parameters every 5 seconds to 
produce both hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, and wind speed and wind direction.  An 
instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150. A laptop 
computer is used to download the data from the datalogger via the SC32A interface.  On -
site weather conditions are measured to verify the accuracy of the readings by the sensors.  
After downloading data, sensors on the weather station are inspected for damage or debris.  
If any problems are found, it is repaired and/or cleaned. Tree limbs and other shrubs are cut 
back to prevent obstruction of the sensors.  Sensors will be removed and sent back to 
Campbell Scientific for calibration at a minimum of every two years. 

5.	Site Location and Character
The ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States, including portions of Charleston, Colleton 
and Beaufort Counties in South Carolina.  The study area encompasses the Ashepoo, 
Combahee, and South Edisto River basins, which empty into St. Helena Sound.  Diverse 
estuarine wetlands provide extensive and complex habitat types for fish and wildlife.  The 
NERR consist of approximately 92,000 acres of tidal marshes.  Of this, 65,600 acres are salt 
marshes, 13,600 acres are brackish marshes and 12,100 acres are freshwater marshes.  
Interspersed within these three tidal marsh zones are approximately 26,000 acres of 
managed wetlands, marsh impoundments.  St. Helena Sound comprises approximately 
23,870 acres of open coastal marine and estuarine waters.  

The weather station is located at the Bennett's Point field station on Mosquito Creek, a 
navigable tributary off of the Ashepoo River.  The station is approximately 90 m from the 
creek (800 m from the Ashepoo River) in a grassy field, 80 m to the southwest of the field 
station.  The closest wind obstructions are oak trees, 25 m to the south and southwest of the 
weather station and 70 m from a public paved road.

The CR10X datalogger and the barometric sensor are enclosed in a 1.8 m elevated 
aluminum box.  Two long poles are attached to the aluminum box, which elevate sensors 
above potential barriers and enhance the performance of each sensor.  The LiCor sensor is 
attached to the outside top of the box.  The Wind Sentry sensor and Temperature/Relative 
Humidity sensor are attached to a cross bar mounted on top of a 3 m pole.  During the 
summer of 2003, ACE Basin staff installed a 15 foot galvanized steal tower.  The Wind 
Sentry, Temperature/Relative Humidity, and the LiCor sensors are now suspended off the 
tower, elevating the sensors approximately 15 feet above the ground.   The Solar Panel is 
attached to 2.5 m long pole, and is oriented to the east at approximately a 47-degree angle.  
The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge (1.3 m height) is located 2.5 m to the southeast of the box 
on a concrete level platform.  The sensors are wired to the CR10X following protocol in the 
CDMO Manual, with minor changes due to upgraded sensors.

8.	Associated Researchers and Projects
The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project is a study, which records long-term water 
quality data for the ACE Basin in order to observe any physical changes or tends in water 
quality over time. The two sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South Edisto 
River. One site represents an urban or "treatment" site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay 
Creek (approximately 14 kilometers from the weather station, GPS coordinates: 
32'29"38.72125N and 80'19"21.69864W). It is surrounded by residential and commercial 
development and subject to nonpoint source pollution. The other site is our pristine site and 
is located in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (approximately 9 kilometers from the weather 
station, GPS coordinates: 32'31"40.59518N and 80'21"41.25481W).  The tidal creek and St. 
Pierre Creek are surrounded by a wide expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh.  Extensive 
mud flats and oyster reefs fringe the banks. Development in the immediate area is sparse, 
and this creek is subject to relatively light boat traffic.  Measurements for both sites are 
taken every thirty minutes over roughly a two-week collection period.

	In July 1997, the Reserve staff initiated nutrient monitoring study.  The objective of the 
study is to ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient levels near our two data 
logger sites.  Nutrient levels are measured during a complete tidal cycle each month, and the 
samples are analyzed for ammonia, nitrite-nitrate, ortho-phosphate, and chlorophyll a 
concentrations.  In January of 2002, the nutrient monitoring protocol was added to the 
NERR System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP). 

	In the spring of 2000, SCDNR Geologists completed the construction of sediment/erosion 
tables (SET) in the ACE Basin NERR, including our water quality stations, to determine the 
effects hydrologic changes on the marsh elevation.  The geologists monitor the SET stations 
monthly.

Dr. Charles Wenner of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute received funding 
through the National Marine Fisheries Service in January of 2001 to continue an ongoing 
survey of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in the South Edisto and Combahee River basins, 
by electro-fishing in tidal freshwater and low salinity brackish water.  Although red drum 
are the target species, all catches are separated, measured and weighted to provide a 
distribution and population size for each species.    

The ACE Basin NERR received initial funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to establish a National Atmospheric Deposition Program site in the Reserve. 
Sampling efforts began on January 1, 2002 and will continue for five years. Weekly 
precipitation samples are collected and analyzed for atmospheric pollutants.  The 
precipitation collector is located on Bear Island, a Wildlife Management Area inside the 
NERR.
			
The ACE Basin participated in the NOAA funded, NERR Invasive Decapod Pilot project.     
Sampling efforts began in August of 2002, and continued through June of 2003.  Utilizing 
the established NERR systems, four northwestern NERR sites and five southeastern NERR 
sites were selected to participate in the pilot project.  The project was designed to 
understand which crabs have invaded which sites.  Identical crab collectors are deployed at 
the participating Reserves, and all crabs found in collectors are identified, measured, and 
counted.  The sex and general condition of crabs (reproductive status, molt stage, obvious 
parasites, etc.) are noted as well.
 
Dr. Clark Alexander of Skidaway Institute and ACE Basin Reserve staff conducted a 
spatial distribution of salinity, at high slack water, in each of the rivers of the ACE Basin in 
September of 2002.  This study was initiated after severe drought conditions impacted the 
NERR during the summer of 2002.  A second sample was conducted in April of 2003.  
			
The results of addition studies conducted in the ACE Basin can be obtained by contacting 
the Reserve.

b)	Data appear to be correct.    
During this time period there was a decrease in cloud cover, an increase of wind speed 
and a change in wind direction.  These factors could account for the decrease in 
temperature and the increase in relative humidity.

Celsius.  (20.658 to 16.986)
Relative humidity difference from February 2 at 1615 to 1630 is greater than 25%.
(30.629 to 57.119)

March 2003
a)	Data appear to be correct.
Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 9 at 1800 to March 10 at 800.
		Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 11 at 1800 to March 12 at 1000.
		Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 12 at 2000 to March 13 at 800.
		Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 13 at 1800 to March 14 at 700.

		Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 23 at 1900 to March 24 at 700.
		Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 24 at 1900 to March 25 at 1000.
		Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s from March 28 at 2000 to March 29 at 1000.
b)	Data appear to be correct. 
During this time period there was an increase of wind speed and a precipitation 
event, which could account for the decrease in temperature.  
Air temperature difference from March 6 at 1130 to 1145 is greater than 3.0 
degrees Celsius.  (22.598 to 19.254)
c)	The following data are suspect.  The rain gauge may have malfunctioned due to the high 
volume of rainfall, although, rain showers and thunderstorms often drop large amounts 
of rainfall in a short amount of time.  
Precipitation difference from March 20 at 1115 to 1130 is greater than 5 mm.
(1.016 to 6.096)

April 2003
a)	Data appear to be correct.

14.	Other Remarks – Daily Total Rainfall Amounts Measured in Millimeters

Calendar Day	Precipitation Total (mm)

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
