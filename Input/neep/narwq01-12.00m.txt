2.	Entry verification:
Data are downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 or YSI Model 6600 sondes to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat) to a PC located at the reserve 
laboratory. Graphs are produced from the .dat files using the Eco-Watch 
application supplied by YSI and examined for obvious sensor failure, using the 
suggested data analysis protocol provided to the NERRS by YSI. A post-deployment 
check is run on the sondes to determine if there is significant sensor drift 
(>10%) due to biofouling. Fouling of sensors is detected by 1) visual inspection 
of the instrument, 2) post-deployment measurements taken using calibration 
standards, and 3) by comparing final measurements of a given deployment with 
initial measurements of the succeeding deployment.
Sea truthing is established by means of water quality measurements using 
standard field methods taken on a regular basis at each NBNERR deployment site.  
Results from these measurements are compared with YSI Model 6000 or YSI Model 
6600 data records. Temperature is measured by mercury thermometer calibrated 
with a NBS certified thermometer.  Dissolved oxygen is determined by a modified 
Winkler titration. Salinity is measured with a Hydrolab Surveyor 3 equipped with 
a salinity/conductivity sensor.  The pH is determined by a Corning bench-top pH 
meter. Turbidity is presently measured with a Secchi disk. Allan D. Beck, former 
NBNERR manager, oversees the monitoring program responsible for these water 
quality measurements.

The comma-delimited files are imported into Excel 97 and a printed version is 
produced to aid in the QA/QC process. The file is processed using macros 
supplied by the CDMO which are designed to: 1) check data files for missing data 
points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods (.), 3) convert 
the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and numeric 
variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the sensors and 
out the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) save the files as Excel 
worksheets (*.xls).  The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to 
flag or delete the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside 
the range expected for the site (see Section 5, Site Location and Character), 2) 
outside the range of measurements and accuracy established for the sensors (Part 
II, Section 8: Variable Sequence, Range of Measurements, Units, Resolution, and 
Accuracy section), or 3) outside the range established for good water quality 
conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen <4 mg/L).  Data are deleted if the anomalies 
are attributed to: 1) a sensor malfunction, or 2) significant fouling of sensors 
by marine organisms.
After appropriate corrections or deletions are made to the Excel worksheet 
(*.xls), the files are exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt).  Patricia 
Richard and Ken Raposa are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
YSI 6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve's (NERR) Water Quality 
Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop long-term data sets for 
representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over 
time. Because Prudence Island is located in the geographic center of 
Narragansett Bay, it is an ideal venue for monitoring hydrographic conditions 
and overall trends within that body of water. One NERR water quality monitoring 
station has been established at Potter's Cove, on the island's northeastern 
shore.  This area is impacted by boat traffic and storm runoff from mainland 
urban and residential areas. The second NERR water quality monitoring station, 
T-Wharf, is situated on the southeastern shore of the island, facing the open 
waters of Rhode Island Sound. It is approximately 6 miles south of the Potter's 
Cove site. Boat traffic is sparse at this site and storm runoff is less likely 
to have a significant impact there, so this station serves as our "control" 
site.  The Narragansett Bay water quality monitoring program began in December, 
1995 at Potter's Cove and in September, 1996 at T-Wharf. (see Section 5, Site 
Location and Character section for description of sites).  YSI electronic data 
loggers were deployed to measure the water temperature, specific conductance, 
dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity conditions, approximately 0.5 meters above 
the bottom, at 30-minute intervals. Change in water level was also recorded. 

4.	Research Methods
One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in Narragansett 
Bay. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on 
season, and measurements are taken every 30 minutes. The monitoring station at 
Potter's Cove was constructed in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted 
vertically on a piling located approximately 6 feet west of a floating dock.  To 
facilitate water flow across the sensors, openings are cut into the PVC pipes.  
The pipes are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are less than 1 meter 
from the bottom.  In 1996, the T-Wharf station was put into service: the PVC 
pipe is mounted on a piling attached to a pier. At the end of the sampling 
period, the data loggers are retrieved and freshly cleaned and calibrated 
instruments are deployed. The retrieved data loggers are brought back to the 
laboratory, post deployment evaluations of the instrument are carried out, and 
the device is cleaned, calibrated, and serviced by methods outlined in the YSI 
Operating and Service Manual. After cleaning the data loggers, the pH, salinity, 
depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 
and 10, salinity standard of 30.36 ppt, depth in the air, and turbidity 
standards of 0 and 100 NTU, respectively.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is 
replaced and allowed to stretch for a minimum of 24 hours before the DO sensor 
is calibrated in water-saturated air. Calibration of the dissolved oxygen sensor 
is usually done within 2 hours of deployment.

5.	Site Location and Character:
The NBNERR consists of 2350 acres of diverse estuarine and terrestrial habitats 
ranging from deep water to salt marshes to forested uplands.  The land holdings 
include 60% of Prudence Island, most of nearby Patience Island and all of Hope

8.	Associated researchers and projects:
Dissolved Oxygen Survey - Under the direction of Dr. Christopher Deacutis, 
NBNERR Research Coordinator, with volunteers from the R.I. Dept. of 
Environmental Management, Roger Williams University, the University of Rhode 
Island, Brown University, the Environmental Protection Agency offices in 
Narragansett, RI and Lexington, MA, the Massachusetts Coastal Zoning Management 
Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Narragansett Bay Commission, Save 
the Bay, Yellow Springs Instruments, and NBNERR staff. The goal of the survey is 
to take discrete samples within the water column (surface, bottom, and every 1.5 
meters of depth) at more than 75 stations in the Narragansett Bay. These surveys 
are performed overnight during neap tide. The project began in 1999, and takes 
place at least twice during the summer. The data will be used to map dissolved 
oxygen levels bay-wide and help to identify sites at risk for hypoxic and anoxic 
events. Inquiries should be directed to Dr. Deacutis at the RIDEM, Dept. of 
Water Resources, 235 Promenade St., Providence RI 02908, tel. (401) 222-4700

11.	Data anomalies:
January 1-31, 2000 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
01/11/00 09:00:00 - 01/31/00 23:30:00 - No data available. Sonde failed to 
record measurements


T-Wharf
01/01/00 00:00:00 - 01/11/-00 07:30:00 - pH probe failure. Calibration records 
indicate trouble prior to deployment, and there is a large discrepancy between 
deployments. All pH data deleted for this deployment.

01/11/00 08:00:00 Data missing due to sonde changeover.

01/11/00 08:30:00 - 01/31/00 23:30:00 - Time stamp was off by 9 min., 13 sec., 
corrected to read on the hour and half hour.

Dissolved oxygen supersaturation numbers (>120%)were recorded on the following 
dates and times:
01/12/00 - 15:30:00-17:30:00, 18:30:00, 22:00:00
01/13/00 - 01:00:00
01/15/00 - 15:00:00, 18:30:00
01/18/00 - 16:00:00, 18:00:00
01/26/00 - 17:00:00, 17:30:00
01/27/00 - 17:00:00
01/28/00 - 17:30:00, 18:00:00
01/29/00 - 00:00:00, 14:00:00-16:00:00, 17:00:00-19:30:00, 20:30:00-23:30:00
01/30/00 - 00:00:00, 10:30:00, 12:00:00-23:30:00
01/31/00 - 00:30:00-01:30:00, 02:30:00, 03:30:00-04:30:00, 05:30:00-07:30:00, 
09:30:00, 11:30:00, 13:30:00, 20:00:00-22:00:00
It is believed that these measurements might be indicative of an algae bloom. 
However, there is a discrepancy >10% in DO percentage compared to subsequent 
deployment, but this is likely normal correctable drift.

Very small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout 
the month, possibly the result of a small calibration error. Data were retained.

February 1-29, 2000 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
02/01/00 00:00:00 - 02/02/00 13:00:00 - No data available. Sonde failed to 
record measurements

02/02/00 13:30:00 - 02/29/00 23:30:00 - Time stamp was off by 6 minutes, 17 
seconds, corrected to read on the hour and half hour.

Dissolved oxygen supersaturation numbers (>120%)were recorded throughout the 
month; a total of 352 data points. Because these measurements are consistent 
with sea truthing data taken during this period, the data were left in the 
dataset. It is believed that these measurements might be indicative of an algae 
bloom.

Very small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout 
the month, possibly the result of a small calibration error. Data were retained. 

T-Wharf
Dissolved oxygen supersaturation numbers (>120%)were recorded on the following 
dates and times:
02/01/00 - 00:00:00-01:00:00, 09:30:00-23:30:00
02/02/00 - 00:00:00-04:00:00, 09:30:00-12:00:00
These numbers might be the result of correctable drift, however all other 
indicators suggest that DO levels were in fact high at this time, even though 
the percentage might be somewhat inflated.
Supersaturation measurements were also recorded on these dates and times:
02/10/00 - 16:30:00, 17:00:00
02/11/00 - 17:30:00
02/12/00 - 16:00:00-19:00:00, 22:30:00, 23:00:00
02/13/00 - 00:30:00, 08:30:00-10:00:00, 11:30:00-13:00:00, 14:30:00, 15:00:00, 
16:00:00, 17:00:00-20:30:00, 22:00:00-23:30:00
02/14/00 - 00:00:00, 00:30:00, 03:00:00
02/16/00 - 11:30:00, 12:00:00, 13:00:00-15:30:00
02/17/00 - 22:00:00-23:00:00
02/18/00 - 00:30:00, 01:00:00, 10:30:00-11:30:00, 13:30:00, 16:30:00
02/21/00 - 16:30:00, 19:30:00
02/22/00 - 13:00:00, 14:00:00-19:30:00
02/23/00 - 16:00:00-20:30:00
02/24/00 - 12:00:00, 16:00:00-17:30:00, 18:30:00, 19:00:00, 20:30:00, 21:00:00
02/27/00 - 13:00:00, 17:00:00-19:00:00
For the sampling period, supersaturation measurements were recorded at the T-
wharf site. Since these readings are consistent with supersaturation 
measurements recorded at the Potter's Cove site, we are confident that these 
numbers suggest an actual supersaturation event, possibly indicative of an algae 
bloom.

Very small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout 
the month, possibly the result of a small calibration error. Data were retained.

March 1-31, 2000 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
03/01/00 00:00:00 - 03/01/00 08:30:00 - Time stamp was off by 6 minutes, 17 
seconds, corrected to read on the hour and half hour.

Final DO measurement for the deployment ending 03/01/00 at 08:30:00 is 
significantly higher than the DO measurement for subsequent deployment beginning 
03/01/00 at 9:00:00. Calibration records indicate that the DO sensor for the 
deployment beginning 03/01/00 at 09:00:00 might have been compromised. The 
instrument measured <90% saturation while in run mode in ventilated calibration 
cup. In addition, sea truthing measurements taken on 03/13/00 at 9:10:00 show 
unattended instrument readings are significantly lower than discrete measurement 
using titration method. Furthermore, the final measurement taken during this 
deployment on 03/29/00 at 08:30:00 is in excess of 10% lower than the first DO 
measurement of the subsequent deployment taken on 03/29/00 at 9:00:00. 
Therefore, we believe that the DO measurements for the deployment 03/01/00 
9:00:00 through 03/29/00 08:30:00 are misleading and we have removed these data 
from the dataset.

03/09/00 02:30:00 - Large negative turbidity measurement (-0629) was logged. 
Data were deleted. 

Very small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout

For the sampling period, a total of 212 supersaturation measurements were 
recorded at the T-wharf site. Since these readings are consistent with sea 
truthing data collected during the period, we are confident that these numbers 
suggest an actual supersaturation event, possibly indicative of an algae bloom.

03/29/00 19:00 - 04/12/00 10:00:00 Turbidity probe malfunction. Data were

April 1-30, 2000 Sampling period 
Potter's Cove:
03/29/00 14:00:00 - 04/12/00 12:00:00 Negative and/or zero turbidity values were 
deleted. 

04/01/00 00:00:00 - DO measurement is anomalous and should be viewed as suspect. 
Unexplained drop in saturation of more than 30%, returns to normal reading 
within the half hour. Unexplained, but the DO probe for this deployment failed 
before retrieval. 

04/12/00 02:30:00 - 04/12/00 12:00:00 - DO measurement in negative numbers. 
Probe 
failure. Deleted data from the file.

Very small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout 
the period 04/01/00 through 04/12/00, possibly the result of a small calibration 
error. Data were retained. 
04/01/00 14:00:00 and 04/11/00 11:30:00: - DO% saturation in excess of 120%. 
These numbers are not wholly inconsistent with the surrounding measurements, so 
were left in dataset.

04/12/00 12:30:00 - 05/05/00 08:30:00 - No record of deployment for this period.

May 1-31, 2000 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
05/05/00 08:30:00 - 05/31/00 10:30:00
Time stamp is off by 4 minutes, 58 seconds. Corrected to read on the hour and 
half-hour. 

Sea truthing DO data taken 05/08/00 08:00:00 is not consistent with measurements 
taken by unattended sonde. There is a variance of more than 10%, however, 
records indicate that measurements were taken at different depths, which could 
account for the variance, so data were left in the dataset. Furthermore, 
subsequent sea truthing data suggests that variance over the course of this 
deployment is not an issue of grave concern, with only a .02 difference in 
measurements for DO mg/L on 05/29/00 at 09:00:00.

DO mg/L measurements for the following dates were below 4 mg/L:
05/26/00 03:30:00;
05/28/00 19:30:00-22:30:00; 05/30/00 00:00:00, 02:30:00, 03:00:00, 04:00:00, 
05:30:00, 07:00:00, 14:00:00, 14:30:00, 15:30:00, 16:00:00, 17:00:00, 19:30:00,

07:00:00, 08:00:00-10:00:00
There is a possibility that biofouling is a factor in these measurements, though 
sea truthing data for 05/29/00 lends some weight to the validity of unattended 
sonde measurements. However, final DO measurement for this deployment is 
significantly different from initial DO measurement for subsequent deployment, 
and we believe that at least some downward drift was a factor in the low 
measurements taken during the final days of the deployment. This data might be 
corrected for drift or deleted upon further consideration.

05/31/00 10:30:00 - 12:00:00 - DO measurements were unexpectedly high. The unit 
was left sitting in full sun in a parked vehicle for an extended period of time 
while deployment routine was demonstrated to new SWMP technicians at another 
station, which might account for the anomaly. These data have been deleted.

Small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout the 
month, possibly the result of a small calibration error. Data were retained.

T-Wharf: 
04/12/00 10:30:00 - 05/05/00 08:30:00 - No record of deployment for this period.
Sea truthing DO data taken 05/08/00 08:00:00 is not consistent with measurements 
taken by unattended sonde. There is a variance of more than 10%, however, 
records indicate that measurements were taken at different depths, which could 
account for the variance, so data were left in the dataset.

DO measurements in excess of 120% were recorded on the following dates and 
times:
05/15/00 - 21:30:00, 22:00:00
05/16/00 - 13:00:00, 16:00:00-17:00:00
There is a possibility that biofouling was a contributing factor in these 
measurements. The data are under review and might be deleted or corrected.

05/27/00 16:00:00 - 05/31/00 23:30:00 -  DO sonde was subject to some serious 
biofouling issues and DO data for theses dates and times were deleted. 

Small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded 05/31 10:00 - 
10:30 and 21:30, possibly the result of a small calibration error. Data were 
retained. 

05/29/00 17:30:00 - turbidity spike to 493.3. This is almost certainly the 
result of biofouling.

June 1-30, 2000 Sampling period
Potter's Cove
Sea truthing data taken 06/05/00 at 08:00:00 and 06/19/00 at 09:00:00 shows 
disparity between DO measurements gathered by unattended sonde. Sonde 
measurements are lower by more than 10%. However, sonde measurements appear to 
track well with other parameters (salinity and pH). We believe the disparity is 
a function of normal correctable drift. 

Several precipitation events might have affected salinity and DO in the month of 
June. On 06/06/00, 2.57" of rain was recorded by the NWS station in Providence, 
RI; subsequent runoff might influence parameters as for several days following 
such an event. On 06/11/00, .9" rain was recorded by the NWS, with immediate 
effects on salinity measurements. Other precipitation events of note are 
06/17/00 .26" and 06/27/00 .2".

The June sampling period yielded an unusually high number of low DO mg/L (<4 
mg/L) measurements, a total of 253 readings on the following dates and times:

A total of 39 instances of DO supersaturation measurements (>120%) were recorded 
during the June sampling period, dates and times as follows:
06/04/00 15:30:00-16:30:00
06/05/00 12:30:00, 15:00:00, 16:00:00, 16:30:00, 17:30:00-18:30:00

06/24/00 04:30:00

06/21/00 09:30:00 - 06/21/00 10:00:00 - Final DO measurement for the deployment 
is significantly different from initial DO measurement for subsequent 
deployment. However, DO measurements track well with other parameters through 
06/28/00, at 18:30:00, when DO begins to drift upward. This corresponds with a 
severe drop in salinity at this same time. Prior to this, turbidity measurements 
indicate some type of biofouling has taken place, possibly an animal caught in 
the sonde guard. We suspect that the salinity and DO measurements taken after 
06/28/00 at 18:30:00 are severely compromised, even though continuity with 
subsequent deployment is within acceptable parameters. The data have been 
deleted. Furthermore, we are not wholly confident in the numbers after 06/26/00 
at 22:30:00, when the first turbidity spike was recorded. The DO data have been 
deleted 06/26/00 22:30:00 - 06/30/00 23:30:00.

Small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout the 
month, possibly the result of a small calibration error. There are 453 such 
negative turbidity measurements in this dataset for the month of June.

06/26/00 22:30:00 - 06/30/00 23:30:00 - Turbidity spikes well in excess of 1000 
NTU through end of 
sampling period. Biofouling is suspected and turbidity data have been deleted.

06/28/00 18:30:00 - 06/30/00 23:30:00 - Sudden, unexplained drop in salinity, 
plummeting to 22.1 from 29 in the space of one half-hour, then rebounding to 
28.42. Biofouling is suspected; data point deleted and associated specific 
conductivity measurement has been deleted.

T-Wharf:
06/21/00 - 09:30:00 - Data missing between deployments.

Unusually high DO measurements were recorded throughout the June sampling 
period. While they look suspicious, sea truthing measurements taken on 06/05/00 
and 06/19/00 agree with these numbers. A total of 460 supersaturation 
measurements were recorded at this site during the June sampling period.

Hypoxic measurements (<4 mg/L) were recorded in 21 instances during the sampling 
period on the following dates and times:
06/13/00 - 00:30:00, 02:00:00, 05:00:00, 22:00:00

06/27/00 - 07:30:00, 09:00:00

Several anomalous DO measurements were recorded throughout the month of June. At 
this time it is unknown what caused these anomalies, and these data are suspect. 
Measurements that are inconsistent with those preceding them and/or following 
them are noted on these dates and times:
06/22/00 - 06:00:00, 16:00:00
06/23/00 - 00:00:00, 12:00:00
06/23/00 - 20:30:00, 21:00:00 Note that salinity measurements are also anomalous 
for these times.
06/24/00 - 03:30:00, 04:30:00, 13:00:00
06/25/00 - 13:30:00, 21:00:00
06/26/00 - 07:30:00, 08:00:00, 18:00:00, 20:30:00
06/27/00 - 07:30:00, 09:00:00, 15:30:00
In all of these cases we suspect transient organic matter has compromised the 
measurements and consider them to be unreliable at best. 

06/23/00 00:00:00 - 00:30:00, 06/29/00 03:30:00 - 06/30/00 23:30:00 Turbidity 
outliers (>1000 NTU) have been deleted for theses dates and times. Turbidity 
probe malfunction.

06/27/00 12:30:00 06/30/00 23:30:00 Salinity, Specific Conductivity and DO data 
have been deleted. Severe biofouling rendered the measurements completely 
unreliable.

Small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout the 
month, possibly the result of a small calibration error. Data were retained.

For the period 07/21/00-07/22/00, prior precipitation events and the attendant 
storm runoff might have influenced measurements. NWS recorded rainfall of .85" 
on 07/15/00 and .41" on 07/18/00.

DO supersaturation measurements (>120%) were recorded throughout the July 
sampling period, data were retained.

07/13/00 17:00:00 - 07/20/00 12:00:00 DO membrane puncture, DO data have been 
deleted.

07/20/00 12:30:00 Anomalous depth which is very low, turbidity is high and pH is 
low possibly due to new deployment that occurred at 12:30:00.  

07/22/00 16:30:00 - 07/31/00 23:30:00 - DO drops, then rises to suspiciously 
high numbers within a few hours. Suspected membrane damage, DO data deleted 
through end of deployment period.

Small negative and/or zero turbidity measurements were recorded throughout the 
month, possibly the result of a calibration error. Data were retained.

Salinity and DO data missing from 07/01/00 00:00:00 to 07/07/00 08:00:00, due to 
severe biofouling.

All data missing 07/07/00 08:30:00 - 07/07/00 09:30:00 because of new 
deployment.

On 07/05/00, a small oil spill took place in Narragansett Bay, almost due east 
of the T-Wharf site. After this date, several island locals reported seeing oil 
on the beach, though the spill was thought to be contained. Furthermore, there 
is a possibility that the oil might have leached through the soil from an 
underground fuel tank located near the T-Wharf site. This tank is part of a 
remediation project being carried out on the reserve. Complicating matters even 
further is the fact that the summer months pose a severe biofouling problem at 
this site, as evidenced by abnormally low salinity numbers. Data were deleted 
for these days and times:07/08/00 05:00:00 - 07/20/00 11:30:00

Salinity measurements might also have been affected by several heavier than 
normal rainfall events which took place in July. The NWS recorded .45" on

Very high DO% measurement on deployment. This was an extremely warm day (the 
sonde logged a temperature of 28.7 degrees C just prior to deployment) and there 
is a possibility that the sonde was affected by this while being transported to 
the site. These data should be considered suspect.

12. Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks/Notes
a) Throughout the summer months, the issue of biofouling seems to play a major 
role in the wide disparity of measurements, most notably at the T-Wharf site. 
Even though sea truthing and post calibration records lend certain credibility 
to the data, there are a number of measurements in the data set that should be 
regarded with suspicion, particularly those where readings change drastically 
over a short period of time. This data continues to be reviewed at the 
collection site, and it is likely that many anomalous data points will be 
deleted during this ongoing process.

 b) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, 
it was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
