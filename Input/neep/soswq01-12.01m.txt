2)	Entry verification

The .dat data files are uploaded to a PC from one YSI-6000 and two YSI-6600 
datasondes using the EcoWatch software.  Graphs are produced using EcoWatch 
software and printed for an initial visual QA/QC check of the data.  Notes are 
made of any suspect data that may result from probe failures and sensors are 
reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .csv files using 
EcoWatch software.  The comma-delimited files are then imported into an Excel 
spreadsheet using the Import macro designed by CDMO that removes headers and 
footers.  Data files are revised using cdmomac3.xls macros that: 1) check data 
files for missing data points; 2) add periods to cells with no data points; 3) 
check for outliers by flagging all data that are outside the acceptable range 
for the sensors; 4) check for correct date and time intervals; 5) format the 
data columns to the CDMO standards for time, date, and numeric variables; 6) 
save the files as Excel worksheets; and 7) generate single parameter monthly 
graphs.  The file is then printed and the data reviewed.  Data at the beginning 
and end of each data record when the instrument was out of the water are 
deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document the times of 
deployment and retrieval and by the sudden change in specific conductivity and 
depth records.  Data in the remainder of the record are not deleted unless 
supporting reasons can be documented.

The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete the 
suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range expected 
for the site (see Site Location and Character, Section 5), 2) outside the range 
of measurements and accuracy established for the sensors (see Section 9), or 3) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions (i.e., turbidity 
>100 NTU).  Data outside the acceptable range of water quality for a particular 
site are investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC 
checks, data printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  Date are deleted if the 
anomalies are attributed to: 1) sensor malfunction - if the voltage reading of 
the sensor is outside the range established for the sensor or the sensor will 
not calibrate, 2) exposure of sensors during low tide - identified by unusual 
depth and specific conductivity data, or 3) fouling of sensors by aquatic 
organisms, debris or sediment - detected by comparing in situ sensor with field 
measurements (see Section 4).  In addition, sensor readings that differ 
significantly (>10%) from standard solutions (e.g., conductivity) suggest that 
the sensor was fouled during deployment.  After corrections are made to the 
Excel worksheet, the edited files are exported as tab-delimited files and sent 
to the CDMO.  All .csv files are also sent to the CDMO via FTP for archival.  
Sue Powell has been responsible for data management since 9/99. 

3)	Research objectives

Three long-term monitoring stations have been established along the estuarine 
gradient of the South Slough in order to collect essential baseline information 
and improve our understanding of tidal dynamics and watershed inputs.  In 
particular, the South Slough NERR/SWMP monitoring stations collect continuous 
information to address three primary topics:  1) short-term variability and 
long-term changes in estuarine water parameters within different regions of the 
estuary (i.e., localized impacts of seasonal storm events, variability in water 
quality parameters in association with re-establishment of tidal circulation, 
interannual differences in rainfall, magnitude and influence of El Niño - La 
Niña events, spatial extent of oceanic and tidal forcing, and long-term changes 
associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, etc.); 2) verification, 
calibration, and future refinement of an existing two-dimensional water quality 
model (CE-QUAL-W2) developed to predict levels of coliform bacteria and 
dispersion of environmental toxins; and 3) collection of fundamental baseline 
data for future development of a three-dimensional tidal hydrodynamic model for 
the greater South Slough/Coos Bay estuaries.

The South Slough estuary contains three primary sub-systems that provide much of 
the freshwater input to the area.  Only two sub-systems, the Sengstacken and 
Winchester arms, are within Reserve boundaries.  One long-term monitoring 
station was sited in the riverine portion of each arm in 1995.  The Sengstacken 
station is located in a semi-pristine area with no development and serves as a 
reference site for the riverine portion of the estuary.  The Winchester station 
is similarly located in an area with development limited to one small farm (<10 
cattle) high in the watershed.  The monitoring station functions as a 
management-treatment site for salt marsh restoration activities in 
the Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project.  The Valino station was 
established in June 1999 in a marine-dominated location downstream from the 
other stations.  It serves as a second reference site.  Future long-term SWMP 
stations are planned that will monitor more locations along the estuarine 
gradient.

YSI data loggers are deployed at each site so that the sensor arrays are held 15 
cm (Sengstacken) to 50 cm (Winchester and Valino) off the bottom of the tidal 
channels that are approximately 3 meters deep.  They are programmed to record 
water quality parameter measurements every 30 minutes over 22-30 day periods.  
Parameters measured include depth, temperature, salinity, specific conductivity, 
pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyll (at Valino and Winchester 
only).

4)	Research methods

One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in the South 
Slough estuary.  All data are recorded in Standard Time.  Winchester and Valino 
sites record chlorophyll data, but because the chlorophyll probe is still in the 
testing phase, the data are not transmitted to CDMO.  Sites are accessed at high 
tides, preferably above 7.0', using a small skiff equipped with an outboard 
motor.  Data loggers are not interchanged among sites.  During transport, each 
sonde is wrapped in a tap-water-soaked white towel and placed horizontally in a 
cooler for insulation against jarring.  To deploy, the data loggers are lowered 
by chain into protective cases (constructed from 4"-diameter ABS plumbing pipe) 
that are affixed vertically to existing log pilings driven into the mud.  The 
cases were drilled out to ensure adequate tidal flushing and exposure of the 
probes to ambient water conditions.  A bolt prevents the data logger from 
descending beyond the ABS pipe.  On Mar. 29, 2001, the Sengstacken ABS pipe was 
inspected for marine growth and obstruction of water flow.  On-site, the bottom 
1-meter of pipe was replaced and attached to the existing pipe via a threaded 
sleeve.  Some sedimentation had occurred, but the sonde sensors were still 
immersed during a 0.2' low tide series.

During retrieval, the data loggers are again wrapped in a white towel and placed 
in a cooler for transport to the lab.  At least two data points are recorded 
while the sonde is wrapped in the towel to record post-deployment dissolved 
oxygen in 100% water-saturated air.  The other post-deployment calibrations are 
performed in the lab prior to cleaning to determine if instrument drift has 
occurred and to evaluate the validity of the data.  Sonde cleaning and 
calibrations of the dissolved oxygen, conductivity, depth, pH, turbidity, and 
chlorophyll probes are performed as outlined in the YSI manual.  For 
conductivity and salinity, YSI calibrator solution 3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used 
without dilution.  Corning pH 7 and 10 solutions are used for two-point pH 
calibrations.  A two-point calibration is conducted for turbidity, with 0 NTU 
(distilled water) and 100 NTU (diluted Hach Formazin 4000 NTU standard).  The 
chlorophyll probe is calibrated with distilled water, and depth is calibrated in 
air.  If the dissolved oxygen membrane is replaced, it is calibrated, allowed to 
stretch for 24 hours, and re-calibrated before deployment, if necessary.  The 
sondes are redeployed 24 hours after retrieval unless safety issues arise during 
poor weather.  

As a quality assurance check, field calibrations are recorded during sonde 
deployment and retrieval.  As close to the 30-minute sonde recording time as 
possible, a hand-held YSI-85 records dissolved oxygen, salinity, conductivity, 
and temperature both at the surface and at the level of the sonde array.

5)	Site location and character

South Slough is characterized as a drowned river-mouth estuary that is 
characteristic of the Lower Columbia Biogeographic Region.  South Slough 
National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-Pacific portion 
of the Columbian Bioregion, extending from Cape Mendicino, CA north to the 
Columbia River, OR estuary.  The South Slough, located five miles southwest of 
Coos Bay, Oregon, is one of seven tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos 
estuary.  The three sites within the South Slough that are being monitored with 
YSI data loggers are:

1)  Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W]
This station serves as a reference site and is located within the riverine 
(southern) region of the Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek) immediately adjacent to 
4.3 ha of natural salt marsh.  The site is approximately 6.6 km from the mouth 
of the South Slough estuary.  Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity 
ranges between 0-28 ppt.  Freshwater inputs have not been quantified. The YSI is 
deployed in a tidal channel approximately 3 m  deep and the sensor arrays are 15 
cm off the bottom.  

During some deployments, the DO is extremely variable, recording very high and 
very low data.  The site was upgraded in March 2001 during a 0.2' low tide.  It 
was noted that as the tide ebbed, the YSI station was isolated from the main 
channel, in a deep pool that completely covered the sensors.  If there is 
groundwater seeping into the site when the YSI is isolated in the pool, it may 
be possible for the DO to decline to very low levels and then reverse quickly as 
the tide rejoins the site to the main channel.

2) 	Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project site): 
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 deg 19.216' W] This station serves as a management-treatment site, 
and is located within the riverine (southern) portion of the Winchester Arm 
(Kunz Marsh) approximately 7.1 km from the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  
The site is adjacent to an experimental marsh restoration area, where dikes were 
removed from a 5.1 ha area in 1996 and 1998.  About 4.2 hectares of natural 
marsh surround the project site.  Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and 
salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt.  Freshwater inputs are between 1-23 cfs. 
Similar to the Sengstacken site, the YSI is deployed in a 3 m deep tidal channel 
with the sensor arrays 50 cm above the bottom. 

This site also experiences variable DO.  A site upgrade is scheduled for 2002 to 
observe the low tide conditions.

Both sites 1 and 2 are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to 
intertidal marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera 
marina).  The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in 
channel width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel 
with regard to the predominant north-south winds.  The watershed above both 
sites is primarily second-growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial 
sites in the watershed.  One residential/small farm site that is outside the 
South Slough Reserve's boundary is located in the Upper Winchester watershed.

3) 	Valino Island:  [43 deg 19.034' N, 124 deg 19.298' W]
This station serves as a secondary reference area and is located in the marine-
dominated central portion of the estuary immediately north of Valino Island.  
The site is approximately 3.6 km from the mouth of South Slough estuary.  
Situated in the primary tidal channel, the station is adjacent to expansive 
eelgrass beds, tidal mudflats, sandflats, and commercial oyster cultivation 
areas.  The tidal range is about 11.7 ft. and salinity ranges between 10-33 ppt. 
The tidal channel is about 4 m deep and the YSI sensors are about 50 cm off the 
bottom. 

The marine dominated region includes the broad open tide flats, extensive 
eelgrass beds and salt marshes. Substrata include eroding sand cliffs, cobble, 
sand, and mud. The region receives freshwater input directly from rainfall and 
via one primary creek. Additional freshwater enters this region indirectly 
(after mixing) during ebb tides from the Winchester and Sengstacken arms of the 
estuary. Tidal waters are typically well mixed throughout the year. There is a 
chronic fecal coliform problem into his area, possibly from failing septic 
systems. In addition, for several months following the February 1999 stranding 
of the ship New Carissa, some oil and grease was found. Extensive invasive 
species have also been documented in this area. 

6)	Data collection period

The data loggers were first deployed at the Winchester site on April 04, 1995 
and at the Sengstacken site on April 19, 1995.  The Valino data logger was 
deployed on June 03, 1999.  All monitoring is long-term with the average data 
collection period of 27 days.  In 2001, the collection dates and times 
were:

8)	Associated researchers and projects

The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State 
of Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the 
Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development and the Oregon Department 
of Environmental Quality in July 1995.

Several researchers are currently using water quality data recorded at the 
Valino YSI station.  Rick Cowlishaw, a Ph.D. candidate from the University of 
Oregon Institute of Marine Biology (OIMB), is investigating the role of 
microzooplankton in planktonic energy transfer and community structure 
in an estuarine habitat.  Chris Wilson, a Ph.D. candidate from Case Western 
University, completed a comparison of sediment transport at three NERR sites - 
OWC, WKB, and SOS.  His work was supported by the Cooperative Institute for 
Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology (CICEET).  Mike Berger, a PhD 
candidate at OIMB, is studying recruitment dynamics of Balanomorph barnacles 
along an estuarine gradient.  His work is currently supported by a NERR 
Graduate Research Fellowship.  Jessica Miller, a PhD candidate at OIMB, is 
investigating the role of estuaries in the patterns of transport, delivery, and 
habitat use in coastal fishes.  A NERR Graduate Research Fellowship also 
supports her work.  Dr. Richard Emlet of OIMB is studying the relationship of 
temperature on barnacle larvae size and using YSI-generated temperature and 
salinity data from Valino and Winchester stations. 

Colin Fisher with the Bureau of Environmental Sciences (City of Portland) 
requested 1995-2001 water quality, sediment, and bacterial data for all 3 
monitoring sites.  After analyzing a number of possible reference sites for the 
Columbia Slough near Portland, the BES determined that South Slough is still in 
a semi-pristine condition.  The data will be used as comparison indices during 
restoration work on the Columbia River Slough.

January 1-31, 2001
Winchester
a.	Zero or negative depth values (to -0.11 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration value was 0.101 m.  Values of SpCond, DO, and Temp 
indicated that sonde was not out of the water, so data were not deleted.
01/06/01 	16:30:00 - 17:30:00
01/07/01 	16:30:00 - 18:30:00
01/10/01 	18:30:00 - 21:30:00
b.	The turbidity spikes in the following records were probably caused by 
transient debris.
Date		Time		Turb
01/21/01	10:00:00	0127
01/28/01	03:30:00	-0480
c.	At 07:00 on January 23, the DO dropped (62.2% from 77.3%) for unknown 
reasons.  The quick recovery of the data to previous levels and the post-
deployment calibration indicated that the membrane was intact.

Sengstacken
a.	Very low DO-no recordings greater than 100% from 01/01/01 00:00:00 - 
01/31/01 23:30:00.  Post-deployment calibration recorded 1/18/01 was 108.1%, 
with field calibration of 8.56 mg/L and 78.3% while sonde recorded 6.86 mg/L and 
63.1%.  Post-deployment calibration was 119.2% (recorded on 02/17/01) with field 
calibrations of 72.6% and 7.21 mg/L, while the sonde recorded 23.7% and 2.4 
mg/L.  Consultation with YSI staff confirmed that the DO probe was failing, and 
data were deleted.

b.	Zero or negative depth values (to -0.16 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration value was 0.08 m on 01/18/01 and -0.145 m on 
02/17/01.  Values of SpCond, DO, and Temp indicated that sonde was not out of 
the water, so data were not deleted.

Winchester
a.	Zero or negative depth values (to -0.11 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was -0.03 m.  On February 8 at 19:30, the SpCond 
dropped to 0.08.  However, at this time or on the following records there were 
no DO, pH or Temp fluctuations consistent with the sonde being out of the water, 
so data were not deleted.
	02/08/01 	20:00:00 - 21:00:00
	02/09/01 	21:00:00 - 21:30:00
b.	On 02/25/01 at 14:30, there was a turbidity spike (127 NTU), probably due 
to transient debris.
c.	The following records include DO data that are greater than 115%.  Post-
deployment calibration was 103.1% in water-saturated air.  Data are consistent 
with those from previous years and were not deleted.
	02/25/01 	15:30:00 - 16:30:00

	02/27/01 	11:30:00
	02/28/01 	12:00:00 - 13:00:00
d.	The following data contains negative SpCond and Salinity values, probably 
due to a calibration error.  Post-deployment calibration was erratic (3.5-6.5 
mS/cm for 10 mS/cm standard).  The data were not deleted and, after cleaning, 
the sensor recalibrated correctly. The entire deployment  from 01/19/01 09:30:00 
to 02/17/01 08:00:00 is suspect due to calibration error.

c. The sonde was removed for maintenance on the ABS pipe from 03/29/01 10:55:00 
- 12:20:00, so all data were deleted.  Prior to removal during 0.2' low tide, it 
was noted that all sonde sensors were submerged.  However, the site becomes 
isolated from the main channel at low tide, so it is not unusual for long 
periods of stationary readings.
d.	Zero or negative depth values (to -0.06 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was 0.101 m on 03/20/01 and 0.032 on 04/24/01.  
There were no DO, pH or Temp fluctuations consistent with the sonde being out of

99.8% and 9.0 mg/L with the sonde recording 104.9% and 9.5 mg/L, indicating that 
the membrane was intact and the sensor was recording accurately.

b.	No turbidity probe was deployed 04/01/01 00:00:00 - 04/30/01 23:30:00.
c.	No data was recorded on 04/11/01 06:30:00 - 08:00:00, probably due to low 
battery voltage.
d.	Noisy DO record shows variable data (35.3% - 134.7%) and appears to track 
with pH.  High DO is consistent with this site during flooding tides.  YSI staff 
reviewed data and concluded that incoming water was super saturated and then 
mixed with low oxygen water, dropping the DO.  It is not possible for DO and pH 
sensors to cross talk.  DO sensor post-calibrated at 98.7% on 05/31/00 and 99.8% 
on 04/24/01.  DO charge and gain for both deployments were within range and 
membranes were intact.  Although there was no known reason for noise - data were 
not deleted.

a.	Negative turbidity values on the following dates are probably due to 
calibration error.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.7 NTU.
06/03/01 	23:00:00
06/06/01 	16:00:00
Turbidity spike (144 NTU) on 06/09/01 02:00:00 was probably due to transient 
debris.
b.	Variable DO (ranging from 22% on 06/27/01 08:00:00 to 177% on 06/08/01 
12:30:00) are common at this site.

Sengstacken
a.	During the post-deployment calibration, it was noted that the turbidity 
wiper was missing.  
Consistent, large readings began on 06/11/01 at 16:30:00 and all turbidity data 
were deleted from 06/11/01 16:30:00 - 06/30/01 23:30:00.
b.	Small negative turbidity values on the following dates are probably due to 
calibration error.

06/09/01 	00:30:00
c.	Turbidity spikes (>100 NTU) on the following records were probably due to 
transient debris.  
06/02/00 	05:00:00
06/07/01 	10:30:00
06/08/01 	09:30:00

06/11/01 	01:30:00, 02:30:00, 08:30:00 - 09:00:00
d.	Positive spikes in Temp and DO occurred in the following records.  These 
spikes appear to be the result of flooding, oxygen-rich water.  Because the SE 
site becomes isolated from the main channel during some spring series low tides, 
once the barrier is breached during a flooding tide, sudden increases are seen 
in some parameters.  Post-deployment calibration for DO was 102.9% in 100% 
water-saturated air.

Valino
a.	Negative turbidity values occurred during the entire deployment (06/01/01 
09:30:00 - 07/02/01 17:30:00) probably due to calibration error.  Post-
deployment calibration was -5.8 NTU on 07/05/01.
b.	These records contain turbidity spikes (>80 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  
	06/08/01 	23:00:00 - 23:30:00

06/30/01 	08:00:00 - 13:00:00, 18:30:00 - 23:30:00
d.	Variable DO is common at this site during spring and summer (values 
ranging from 27.7% to 146.6%).  However, on 06/22/01 07:00:00, a large drop in 
SpCond indicates that the sonde was out of the water.  The data were deleted.

July 1-31, 2001
Winchester
a.	Negative turbidity values on the following dates are probably due to 
calibration error.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.2 NTU.
07/16/01 	20:30:00
07/21/01 	15:30:00
07/22/01 	00:30:00, 13:30:00 - 16:30:00
Turbidity spikes were recorded on 07/07001 02:30:00 (193 NTU), 07/08/01 22:30:00 
(266 NTU), and the optical port may have been covered from 07/28/01 07:30:00 to 
07/30/01 03:00:00.  Rainfall amounts were probably insufficient to cause such a 
long-term change.  The sensor seemed to recover but stayed above 40 NTU until 
07/31/01 10:30:00, when it returned to baseline values.  The data were not 
deleted.
b.	Variable DO (ranging from 22.9% on 07/29/01 23:00:00 to 156.9% on 07/27/01 
15:00:00) is common for this site.

Sengstacken
a.	Turbidity data were deleted from 07/01/01 00:00:00 to 07/05/01 13:00:00 
due to missing wiper.  See June notes above.
b.	Turbidity spike (>100 NTU) on 07/18/01 06:00:00 was probably due to 
transient debris. 
c.	Although variable DO is common for this site, the range during this 
deployment is extreme (0.4% to 133%).  Data from past years were compared and 
show similar trends during low tides, although not quite as low.  Because this 
site is isolated from the main channel during low tides, it is possible for DO 
to be depleted due to environmental conditions.  The post-deployment 
calibration was 103.3% on 08/01/01, the membrane was intact, and passed the 
integrity test.  The field calibration unit failed so there were no field 
checks.  Data were not deleted. 

Valino
a.	During the following periods, no data were recorded due to battery 
failure.
07/01/01 	00:00:00 - 16:00:00

07/02/01 	04:00:00 - 17:00:00
In addition, data in the following records showed low pH and high turbidity 
values that were inconsistent with normal conditions at that site.  Because 
battery voltage was very low, the data were deleted.
07/01/01 16:30:00 - 18:00:00
07/02/01 03:30:00, 17:30:00
b.	This record contains a negative turbidity value probably due to 
calibration error.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.07 NTU on 08/01/01.

d.	Variable DO is common at this site during spring and summer (values 
ranging from 20.2% to 157.9%).  On 07/22/01 18:00:00, the DO dropped about 50% 
and stayed low for the remainder of the deployment.  Post-calibration recorded 
106.3% and the membrane was intact.  YSI personnel suggested that some debris 
had attached to the probe and was subsequently dislodged on retrieval.  Data 
were deleted from 07/22/01 18:00:00 to 07/31/01 23:30:00.
e.	SpCond readings seemed slightly higher than normal for this site from 
07/06/01 13:30:00 to 07/31/01 23:30:00, possibly due to calibration error.  The 
post-deployment calibration was 11.63 mS/cm for 10.00 mS/cm standard.  Field 
calibration recorded 33.5 ppt while the sonde recorded 34.3 ppt.  Data were not 
deleted.
f.	From 07/06/01 13:30:00 - 07/31/01 23:30:00, no pH sensor was deployed due 
to a malfunction.

a.	New YSI 6600 meter deployed at WI site.
b.	From 08/01/01 11:30:00 - 08/31/01 23:30:00, the time stamp was reset to 
record on the half hour.
c.	Zero or negative depth values (to -0.07 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was -0.06 m.  There were no SpCond, DO, pH or Temp 
fluctuations consistent with the sonde being out of the water, so data were not 
deleted.

08/31/01 	05:00:00 - 07:30:00
d.	During the following period, the turbidity data were deleted because the 
sensor wiper malfunctioned.  During the post-deployment calibration, it was 
noted that the wiper parked over the optics.  Because it was not clear exactly 
when the wiper malfunctioned, the data were deleted following the last 
discontinuity.
08/20/01 	17:00:00 - 08/31/01 23:30:00
e.	DO data was unusually high and were deleted from 08/16/01 at 12:30:00 to 
the end of the deployment on 09/04/01 13:00:00 because they were out of phase 
with depth which is not normal for this site.  Although post-deployment 
calibration was 103.1%, it is possible that the membrane was perforated.  Field 
calibrations with a hand-held meter recorded 78.0% and 7.64 mg/L at 13:00:00, 
while the YSI recorded 123.0% and 9.5 mg/L.  Other field calibrations correlated 
very well with the YSI data.  Some detritus may have covered the probe that was 
dislodged when the sonde was retrieved.
f. 	Negative turbidity values on the following dates are probably due to 
calibration error. No post-deployment calibration was recorded. Data were 
retained.

d.	Negative turbidity values occurred during the entire deployment (08/02/01 
11:00:00 - 09/04/01 12:00:00) probably due to calibration error.  Post-
deployment calibration was -3.5 NTU on 09/04/01.

c.	From 09/01/01 00:00:00 to 09/11/01 17:00:00, DO was variable as in 
previous months (ranging from 0.4% to 147%).  Data were not deleted.
d.	DO data were deleted from 09/11/01 17:30:00 to 09/30/01 23:30:00 because 
they exceeded the normal range for this site.  It is possible that biofouling 
was responsible, although post-deployment calibration (106.9%) was not as high 
was would be expected.  Visual inspection during retrieval did not note any 
abnormality with the probes. It is possible that some live plant material 
obscured the DO sensor until it was retrieved, producing oxygen and artificially 
inflating the data.  However, one would expect a circadian fluctuation with DO 
levels higher during the day and lower after sunset when plants respire.  Field 
calibration at the site was 53.4% and 3.20 mg/L on the channel bottom and 74.4% 
and 6.34 mg/L at the surface.  Sonde recordings for the same period were 204% 
and 16.9 mg/L.

Valino
a.	Negative turbidity values occurred during the entire deployment (09/15/01 
13:00:00 - 10/01/01 10:30:00) probably due to calibration error.  Post-
deployment calibration was -1.3 NTU on 10/01/01.
b.	These records contain turbidity spikes (>80 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.

c.	Variable DO is normal for this site (values ranging from 20.3% to 120.9%).  
However the following period shows very low DO.  Post-deployment calibration was 
98.3% and the membrane was intact.  Field calibration recorded 89.6% and 7.78

correspond to spring low tides.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.037 m.  Where 
there were no DO, pH, SpCond or Temp fluctuations consistent with the sonde 
being out of the water, the data were not deleted.

b.	Negative turbidity values occurred during the entire deployment (10/02/01 
12:00:00 - 10/29/01 11:00:00) probably due to calibration error or because 
optical port may be scratched.  Post-deployment calibration was -1.5 NTU on

a.	Turbidity was very erratic from 12/01/01 00:00:00 to 12/07/01 12:30:00.  
The majority of the spikes ranged from 190 - 230 NTU.  For several stretches, 
the Turbidity varied from high to low levels every hour (e.g., 12/01/01 06:00:00 
- 12:00:00).  On 12/07/01 13:00:00 just prior to the flooding tide, the value 
pegged at around 1555 until 12/13/01 17:30:00 during the peak low.  
Values were variable until the end of the deployment on 12/17/01 07:30:00.  It 
is possible that some detritus lodged around the wiper, preventing it from 
turning until it was dislodged.  Data were deleted from 12/07/01 13:00:00 to 
12/13/01 17:30:00.  This deployment was delayed by bad weather for 3 days.  
Although it is unlikely, the Turbidity probe may have suffered some sort 
of damage during that time, as the YSI was in unattended mode in the laboratory.  
The probe will be evaluated during following deployments. High turbidity (>100 
NTU) in the following records are probably due to transient debris from high 
precipitation events (see Winchester above). Post-deployment calibration was -
1.2 NTU on 01/14/02.

Post-deployment calibration value was 0.009 m on 12/17/01 and -0.01 m on

*erratic or otherwise questionable data
The YSI-85 failed on 07/05/01 and back in service on 09/04/01.  A YSI-30 was 
used in the interim.Prior to 5/01, calibration of DO was questionable.

14)	Other remarks/notes

Editing of data followed CDMO protocol.  Data outside the range specifications 
of the instrument were rejected, except for depth and turbidity.  Negative depth 
values were not rejected unless they corresponded to specific conductivity data 
indicating that the sonde was out of the water.  Large positive turbidity spikes 
(>80 NTU for VA site and >100 NTU for WI and SE) were reported in the anomalous 
data section.  In general, if no probe failure could be documented from the pre- 
and post-deployment calibration data, the data were retained but reported in the 
anomalous data section.  A hand-held YSI- 85 was used for field calibration and 
data were recorded both from the surface and at YSI-deployment depth.  Because 
they duplicated YSI recording locations, only recordings from the bottom were 
reported.
