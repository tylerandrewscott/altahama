2.   Entry verification:
     The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 sonde to a comma 
delimited file(*.csv) and PC6000 file (*.dat). The comma delimited file is 
imported into standardized Excel 5.0worksheet (*.xls) that was generated by a 
CDMO macro. Then, the data file is formatted and processed with other CDMO 
macros that will: 1) check data file for missing data points, 2) fill all cells 
which do not contain data with periods (.), 3) convert the data column to the 
CDMO-approved formats for time, date and numeric variables, and 4) find all data 
that are out of acceptable range for the data logger's sensors and out the 
anomalous data to an output file (*.dat).
     The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to delete or flag the 
suspect data. Data are deleted if  the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor 
malfunction, 2) exposure of  sensors during low tide, or 3) fouling of sensors 
by aquatic organisms, debris, or sediment. Data are flagged if the values are: 
1)outside the range expected for the site, 2) outside the range established for 
the sensors, or 3) outside the range established for good water quality 
conditions (i.e. dissolved oxygen <28%). Corrections are made to the data file, 
and the file is exported as a tab-delimited file to the CDMO. Saundra Upchurch 
and Christopher Graffeo are responsible for these tasks.

3.   Research Objectives:
Agriculture and silviculture are not major industries within the Reserve 
boundaries but impacts due to development on Edisto Island may be a problem. 
EPA-EMAP sampling in the South Edisto River indicated that contaminant levels 
were higher than expected. Based on discussions with local CZM personnel and our 
knowledge of land use within the Reserve, the South Edisto River drainage basin 
appears to be best suited for studying contrasting hydrographic conditions and 
land use patterns. One station is located by Edisto Island, within a tributary 
off Big Bay Creek.  Surrounded by residential and commercial development and 
likely subject to non-point source pollution, this station is designated as the 
"treatment" site. The second station is located by Bailey Island, within a 
tributary off St. Pierre Creek. No urban development occurs in this area 
surrounding the second station; thereby this station will serve as our "control" 
site.

4.   Research methods
     The data loggers are programmed to record at 30-minute intervals. YSI 
procedures are used to calibrate and clean the sondes. The following standards 
are used to calibrate the sensors: pH 7 and 10;turbidity standards of 0 and 100 
NTU; and conductivity standard of 58.64mS/cm; oxygen sensor in air-saturated 
water; and depth in the air. The pH and oxygen sensors are calibrated before 
each deployment, and the others are only calibrated if the post-check readings 
are significantly different from standard. To determine if the readings drifted 
significantly during deployment, sensor readings are compared to standard 
readings and to in-situ readings that are taken at the beginning and at the end 
of each deployment.  The voltage output of each sensor is checked to determine 
if the sensors are working properly. Other checks conducted on the sensors are: 
1) DO membrane puncture and proper parking of turbidity pad. The results of the 
data and sensors checks are used to evaluate the validity of the data (see Entry 
Verification section).
Prior to the YSI deployment, a 12-foot galvanized pole was driven two feet into 
the mud, and a 4-inch diameter PVC pipe, with precut holes, was bolted onto the 
pole approximately one foot above the creek bottom. The holes, or windows, were 
cut out at the bottom of the pipes for the probes to have direct contact with 
the water column.  Before being placed in the tubes the sondes are placed in net 
bags with 1/8inch mesh to keep out  crabs and fish.
      On February 7, the deployment method at the St. Pierre Creek site was 
changed. The sonde is now deployed in a pyramid shaped cage that is 2.5 feet 
long and 1.5 feet  high. A PVC pipe, with pre-cut holes, is strapped 
horizontally across the top of the cage, which is about one foot off  from the 
creek bottom.  The cage is tethered to a galvanized pole to prevent any possible 
dragging by the tide. Before being placed in the tubes the sondes are placed in 
net bags with 1/8-inch mesh to keep out  crabs and fish.
We modified the St. Pierre deployment apparatus several times during the year 
because the apparatus was trapping sediment. We drilled more and larger holes in 
the PVC pipe and orient the sensors away from the marsh bank and the general 
flow of the water to prevent sediment from collecting around the sensors. 
However, we need a more permanent solution to the sediment problem, so we will 
conduct an extensive investigation of the erosion problem at the site.

5.   Site location and character:
     The two sampling sites are located in two tributaries off South Edisto 
River. The descriptions of the sites are as follows:
     Station A--this site is located in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek 
(GPS coordinates: 3229.662N and 80 19.427W). Surrounded by residential and 
commercial development and likely subject to non-point source pollution, this 
station is designated as the "treatment" site. Pollution sources include houses 
bordering the creek, many with little setback from the bordering Spartina marsh; 
20 docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and Wolmanized pilings; 
boat dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a paved road and three 
boat ramps off the creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA treated bulkheads and 
fueling areas located about 0.5 miles downstream; two commercial seafood docks 
with8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three restaurants. The creek is closed to 
shellfish harvesting indicating a high concentration of fecal coliforms. 
Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora 
with isolated areas of Salicornia. Upland fringe areas consist of cabbage 
palmetto, live oak and cedars. Reefs of American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) 
fringe the creek banks. At the time of reconnaissance, depth of the creek midway 
through ebb tide was 5 feet and salinity was 23%.
     Station B--this site is located in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32 31.724Nand 80 21.573W). It is surrounded by a wide expanse of 
Spartina alterniflora marsh. Extensive mud flatsand oyster reefs fringe the 
banks. Upland areas are dominated by maritime forest with wax myrtles, liveoaks, 
and palmettos. No development and no agriculture occur in this portion of the 
reserve. This creek is subject to little boat traffic. At the time of 
reconnaissance, depth at low tide was 2.5 feet and salinity was21%.

7.   Associated researchers and projects:
In 1993, the Reserve staff initiated a long-term survey of the decapod 
crustaceans and juvenile fish that utilize the estuarine waters of the Reserve 
as a nursery ground. Data collected during the survey over the long term will be 
utilized to assess temporal and spatial changes in species composition, 
diversity and biomass within the Reserve.   
During 1994, Drs. Judith and Peddrick Weis studied the impacts of Chromated 
Copper Arsenate(CCA)-treated wood on the surrounding benthic communities at 
several Reserve sites, including the ACE Basin and North Inlet-Winyah Bay. The 
objective of their study was to determine to what degree and over what distances 
benthic fauna may be adversely affected by the contaminants. In our Reserve, 
surface sediment grabs were collected near CCA-treated wood and concrete marine 
structures in Big Bay Creek and near an undisturbed salt marsh along St. Pierre 
Creek.  The findings indicated that concentrations of the metals (Cr, Cu, and 
As) in sediments adjacent to pilings at the sites were generally not 
significantly elevated, and there were no consistent differences in the benthic 
communities. Thus, it appears that metalleachates from the pilings, even the new 
ones, in reasonably flushed areas like the Reserve have negligible ecological 
effects.
From 1994-1996, Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews studied the distribution of 
contaminants (i.e.trace metals, PAHs, pesticides) in sediments within the river 
systems the Reserve, including the creeks where the data loggers are located. 
The findings of the three-year surface sediment contaminant study
indicated that trace metal and PAH concentrations in the sediments did not 
contain toxic concentrations(below levels that are toxic to estuarine organisms) 
of either.  Almost all samples were below the level of detection for persistent 
pesticides and for PCBs, suggesting that the ACE is a relatively pristine 
system.  However, highest values of PAHs encountered (299.0 ng/g) were in the 
South Edisto at Big Bay Creek;  this station also had detectable levels of PCBs, 
concentrations are well.
      In July 1997, the Reserve staff and The ACE Basin NERR Graduate Fellow, 
Christopher T.Nietch, initiated nutrient studies. The objective of the Reserve's 
study is to ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient levels near 
our two data logger sites. Nutrient levels are measured during a complete tidal 
cycle each month, and the samples are analyzed for ammonia, nitrite-nitrate, and 
ortho-phosphate concentrations. Mr. Nietch will evaluate the relationship 
between surface water quality, and the carbon and nutrient cycling in tidal 
marshes.

c)    The following records include low salinity readings that are less than 18 
ppt. These readings are not within normal polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 
and 40 ppt) for this site, therefore all data were deleted during these times.
The low readings were probably due to extremely low tides or heavy rainfall events.

c)    During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during deployment by sediment from the nearby 
eroding bank. DO readings drifted downward during the deployment, and the final 
YSI's DO reading was significantly lower than a in-situ Winkler DO check (-0.25 
and 5.0 mg/L, respectively). Post-deployment DO calibration check indicated that
the DO membrane was not damaged by the fouling. (see Research Methods section)

d)    During the following periods, the specific conductance and salinity data 
were deleted because the sensor was fouled during deployment. The readings 
drifted downward during a similar time period as the DO downward drift, 
suggesting the sediment from the eroding bank was the cause of the low      
readings. The data logger was moved away from the bank.

c)    During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during deployment. DO readings drifted downward 
during the deployment, and the final YSI's DO reading was significantly lower 
than a in-situ Winkler DO check (0.28 and 7.4 mg/L, respectively). Post-
deployment DO calibration check indicated that the DO membrane was not      
damaged by the fouling.

a)    During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during deployment by sediment from the nearby 
eroding bank. DO readings drifted downward during the deployment, and the final 
YSI's DO reading was significantly lower than a in-situ Winkler DO check (-0.25 
and 5.0 mg/L, respectively). Post-deployment DO calibration check indicated that      
the DO membrane was not damaged by the fouling. (see Research Methods section)
      3/01/97   THRU 3/05/97             00:00:00-10:30:00
b)    During the following periods, the specific conductance and salinity data 
were deleted because the sensor was fouled during deployment. The readings 
drifted downward during a similar time period as the DO downward drift, 
suggesting the sediment from the eroding bank was the cause of the low      
readings. The data logger was moved away from the bank.

c)    The following records include negative turbidity data. The negative 
readings were caused by sediment on the lens. The negative readings were the 
result of fouling of the turbidity sensor by sediments that had accumulated in 
the PVC tube because the new deployment apparatus sunk about a foot into the mud 
(see Research Methods section).

a)    The following records include low dissolved oxygen data (<28% air sat). 
The low readings occurred primarily during early flood tides; on September 11, 
DO remained low from early to maximum flood tide, and the cause of the anomalous 
event is not known at this time.

a)    During the following periods, dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because DO membrane was damaged during deployment. Periods of exposure appear to 
be the cause of the too low or too high DO readings. The sensor appeared to 
recover near the end of the deployment (final readings were within the normal 
range, and a normal DO periodicity pattern was observed), but the data were 
suspect and deleted.

periods of low water levels; however, at this time, we have no conclusive 
evidence that indicates a correlation between the two events.

      Big Bay
a)    From 00:00 on January 1 to 09:00 on January 7, the dissolved oxygen (DO) 
data were deleted because the DO membrane was damaged during deployment.
b)    From 09:30 on January 7 to 09:00 on  January 14, no data are available due 
to downtime for servicing and calibrating of data loggers and sampling 
conflicts.

to downtime for servicing and calibrating of data loggers.
c)    During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during deployment by sediment from the nearby 
eroding bank. DO readings drifted downward during the deployment, and the final 
YSI's DO reading was significantly lower than a in-situ Winkler DO check (-0.25 
and 5.0 mg/L, respectively). Post-deployment DO calibration check indicated that      
the DO membrane was not damaged by the fouling. (see Research Methods section)

a)    During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during deployment by sediment from the nearby 
eroding bank. DO readings were extremely low (<1.0 mg/L), indicating that the DO 
membrane was blocked by debris or sediment. Post-deployment DO calibration check 
indicated that the DO membrane was not damaged by the fouling. (see Research 
Methods section)
      10/09/97 THRU 10/14/97       09:00:00-10:30:00
b)    During the following periods, the specific conductance and salinity data 
were deleted.  The readings drifted downward during a similar time period as the 
DO downward drift, suggesting that the sediment from the eroding bank was the 
cause of  the low readings. (see Research Methods section)
      10/09/97 THRU 10/14/97       09:00:00-10:30:00
c)    From 11:00 on October 14 to 12:30 on October 16, no data are available due 
to downtime for servicing and calibrating of data loggers.
