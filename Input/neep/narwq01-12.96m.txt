2.  Entry verification.

Other water quality measurements are made by standard field methods at the time of datalogger deployment 
and weekly thereafter.  Results are compared with YSI 6000 data records.  Data may be corrected based on 
the comparative analyses and is then so noted in the data anomalies section of the metadata form.  
Temperature is measured by  mercury thermometer calibrated with a NBS certified thermometer.  Dissolved 
oxygen is determined by a modified Winkler titration.  Salinity is measured with a Hydrolab Surveyor 3 
equipped with a salinity/conductivity sensor.  The pH is determined by a Corning benchtop pH meter.  
Turbidity is presently measured with a Secchi disk.  (This method does not provide data that is comparable 
to the YSI data.  An appropriate method recommended by the manufacturer and accepted by the scientific 
community will be used in the future.)  Allan Beck is responsible for these water quality measurements.

Data is uploaded to a PC from the YSI datalogger using the PC6000 software in both the PC6000 format 
and in comma delimited format.  The comma delimited data is opened in Excel 5.0 and edited to remove 
headers and extra spaces.  Each file contains a month’s data and missing days are denoted by periods.  All 
files have been verified using the Excel 5.0 macro programs which discover outliers (values out of the 
measurement range of the dataloggers).  Eleanor Kinney is responsible for the formatting and QA/QCing of 
the data.

3.  Research objectives.

YSI6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay as part of the National 
Estuarine Research Reserve’s (NERR) Water Quality Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop long-
term datasets for representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over time. The 
instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time and measurements taken every 30 minutes. 
Currently two stations on Prudence, Potter Cove in the north and the T-wharf at the south end, have been 
established.   The Potter Cove site, which was established in December, 1995 receives waste from boaters 
and is considered an impacted site.  The T-wharf site at the southern tip of the island was established in 
September, 1996, and is considered relatively unimpacted.

4.  Research Methods.

Before each deployment, routine maintenance and calibration of the YSI instrument is carried out.  The 
instrument is cleaned to remove any biofouling and the probes checked for cracks or other visible signs of 
damage.  O-rings are cleaned and greased, and batteries installed.  Calibrations are performed for salinity, 
pH, dissolved oxygen, depth, and turbidity.  For the salinity calibration, filtered seawater from Narragansett 
Bay is collected and its salinity determined using an autosal.  This seawater is then used  as a salinity 
standard. A two point pH calibration is performed using premade buffer solutions of pH 7 and 9 obtained 
from Fisher Scientific. Old pH solutions are used for rinsing the probes.  The dissolved oxygen membrane 
is replaced 24 hours prior to calibration.  The DO probe is then calibrated by placing a wet sponge in the 
calibration cup and allowing the instrument to equilibrate as per the manufacturer’s instructions for 100% 
air saturation calibration.  The depth sensor is calibrated to sea level with the sonde standing up in air, 
calibration cup removed.  The turbidity sensor is calibrated using distilled water (NTU = 0).  

Currently a northern site, Potter Cove, and a southern site, the T-wharf (established 9/96), are being 
monitored.. The sondes are deployed  in PVC tubes with sections cut out to allow water flow.  The PVC 
tubes are attached to docks at each site.   The sondes are programmed to collect data every 30 minutes 
during deployment.  Deployments generally last two weeks to four weeks and while initially there were gaps 
of several days between deployments, they are now continuous unless some mishap occurs.  At the end of 
each deployment, the data is uploaded, put in Excel format and QA/QC’d using the Excel Macros provided 
by the CDMO.  

5.  Site Location and Character.

10.  Data anomalies.

January, 1996:  
PC: Salinity values collected by the PC datalogger from 1/12/96 11:00:00 to 1/24/96 10:30:00 
were high.  A post-deployment calibration indicated that the sonde was reading 2.09 ppt too high.  This 
error could have resulted from a problem with the pre-deployment calibration.  Due to the federal 
government shutdown in January, the autosal generally used in salinity calibrations was unavailable.  A 
specific conductance standard was used instead.  This is an inferior method of calibration for 
measurements in seawater.  It is also possible that the error could have resulted from entering 
conductance instead of specific conductance during calibration.  This would have caused an inflated 
reading since the calibration was probably not carried out at 25 C.  It is possible specific conductance
was mistakenly calibrated as conductance, leading to this error.  Therefore, specific conductivity, salinity
and DO mg/L were suspicious and deleted from file.  

February, 1996: 
PC:  First three DO % and mg/L values were higher than rest of deployment; possible the membrane 
had not settled yet.  DO % and mg/L values from 2/9 07:00 to 08:00 were deleted for this reason.  
	
March, 1996:  
PC:  First three DO% and mg/L values of deployment on 3/12 were higher than rest of deployment; 
possible the membrane had not settled yet.  DO% and mg/l values from 3/12 19:00 to 20:30 were deleted 
for this reason. 

April, 1996:  None to report

May, 1996:  None to report

June, 1996:  
PC:  Dissolved oxygen at Potter Cove experienced a dramatic jump on June 8th from 106.7% (8.52 
mg/l) at 17:00 to 250.4% (19.75 mg/l) at 17:30.  The DOSAT continued to exceed 200% until 6/12 and 
then gradually began to decline until the end of the deplyment (6/24, 9:00).  When the sonde was 
retrieved, the DO probe was heavily fouled and a crab was inhabiting the probe guard.  A post-
deployment check indicated that the probe was malfunctioning.  All DO data from 6/8 17:30 to 6/24 
9:00 was deleted from the data set (see Missing Data Section).  DO data from 6/24 10:30 through 
7/8 10:00 also suspected DO membrane puncture; data deleted.  
	During period when turbidity probe deployed at PC (6/7/96 13:00 to 6/24/96 9:00), there were five 
large negative readings, ranging from -137 to -646 NTU.  When the probe was retrieved, the wiper was 
parked over the optics, and this may have been the cause of the anomalies.  The data was deleted (see 
Missing Data section) and the probe had to be returned for repair.

July, 1996:
PC:  DO data from 6/24 10:30 through 7/8 10:00 also suspected DO membrane puncture; data deleted.  
Anomalous dissolved oxygen (DO) data from 7/8 10:30 through 7/22 9:30.  Data negative, 
indicating internal probe failure.  Data deleted (see Missing Data section) and probe returned for repair.  
DO data also experienced a large jump on 7/26 from 3.6 mg/l (6:00) to 25 mg/l (6:30).  Data remained 
very high for rest of July and beginning of August (DOSAT 500-600%).  Post-deployment check 
revealed a puncture in the membrane.  All DO data from 7/26 6:30 through 7/31 23:30 was deleted.

August, 1996:
PC: Very high dissolved oxygen values (500/600%) 8/1 00:00 through 8/5 9:30 due to membrane 
puncture during deployment.  DO data deleted (see Missing Data section). DO data deleted from 8/5 10:00 through 
8/26 09:00 due to suspected DO membrane puncture.   

September, 1996: None to report

October, 1996:
PC:  Large, negative turbidity numbers (c. -642) on 10/13 11:00 and from 10/14 10:30 through end of 
sonde’s deployment, 10/30 14:00.  Post deployment check of turbidity probe revealed that wiper post 
was not turning due to internal problem.  Data deleted (see Missing Data section) and probe sent in for 
repair.  Turbidity values from 10/30 15:00 - 20:00 were small and negative (-1 or -2), indicating small 
calibration error.

TW:  There appears to be a DO membrane puncture from 10/7 23:00 through 10/20 09:00; data were deleted.

November, 1996
PC:  Low negative turbidity numbers (-1 to -5) from 11/1 to 11/27 due to small calibration error.  
Dissolved oxygen data suddenly went negative (-99.9%) on 11/17 and remained at -99.9% until 11/27 
when a new sonde was deployed.  The -99.9% reading is indicative of internal probe failure and the 
data were deleted (see missing Data section).


December, 1996:  None to report. 


11.  Missing Data.

January, 1996
Datalogger with turbidity sensor arrived at end of month, so some turbidity data collected.

PC:  No data from 1/3/96 13:30:00 through 1/12/96 10:30:00 due to winter storms.
No data from 1/24/96 11:00:00 through 1/26/96 9:00:00 for servicing.  No turbidity data from 
1/1/96 00:00:00 through 1/26/96 9:00:00.  Specific conductance, salinity and DO mg/L data deleted 
from 1/12/96 11:00:00 through 1/24/96 10:30:00 (see section 11). 

February, 1996
PC:  No data from 2/7/96 14:00:00 through 2/9/96 6:30:00 and from 2/21/96 11:30:00 through 
2/23/96 11:00:00 for servicing.  No turbidity data from 2/7/96 14:00:00 through the end of the month 
since deployed sondes not equipped with turbidity sensors.  First three DO % and mg/L values
were higher than rest of deployment; possible the membrane had not settled yet.  DO % and mg/L values from 
2/9 07:00 to 08:00 were deleted for this reason.  

March, 1996
PC:  No data from 3/6/96 15:00:00 through 3/12/96 18:30:00 for servicing. No turbidity data for entire
month since deployed sondes did not have turbidity sensors.  First four DO% and mg/L values of deployment 
on 3/12 were higher than rest of deployment; possible the membrane had not settled yet.  
DO% and mg/l values from 3/12 19:00 to 20:30 were deleted for this reason.

April, 1996
PC:  No data from 4/8/96 19:00:00 through the end of the month due to flooded battery compartment.  
Turbidity data only collected on 4/8/96 from 13:00 to 18:30.
	
May, 1996
PC:  No data from 5/1/96 00:00:00 through 5/3/96 09:30:00 for servicing.  No turbidity data for entire 
month since deployed sondes did not have turbidity sensors.

June, 1996
PC:  No turbidity data from 6/1/96 00:00:00 through 6/7/96 12:00:00 or from 6/24 9:30:00 through 
6/30 23:30:00  since deployed sondes not equipped with turbidity sensors. 
Turbidity data anomalous - large negative numbers - and therefore deleted for:
		6/8	20:30	(-645 NTU)
		6/14	14:00	(-645.7 NTU)
			14:30	(-646 NTU)
		6/19	00:00	(-137.5 NTU)
		6/20	14:00	(-191.4 NTU)
		6/23	16:00	(-645 NTU)
No data, any variable, on 6/7 12:30 and on 6/24, 9:30 and 10:00 due to servicing.
DO data from 6/8 17:30:00 through 6/24 9:00:00 were deleted because values were 
anomalously high, mostly likely from crabs puncturing the membrane.  DO data from 6/24 10:30 through 
7/8 10:00 also suspected DO membrane puncture; data deleted.  

July, 1996
PC:  No turbidity data for entire month since turbidity probe being repaired.
DO data from 6/24 10:30 through 7/8 10:00 also suspected DO membrane puncture; data deleted.  
DO data deleted from 7/8 10:30 to 7/22 9:30 due to probe failure.  DO data deleted from 
7/26 6:30 to 7/31 23;30 due to membrane puncture.

August, 1996
PC:  DO data deleted from 8/1 00:00 to 8/5 9:30 due to membrane puncture during deployment.
DO data deleted from 8/5 10:00 through 8/26 09:00 due to suspected DO membrane puncture.  
No data, any variable, from 8/26 9:30 through 8/31 23:30 due to batteries running out.

September, 1996
PC:  Deployment delayed until 9/11 9:00 due to servicing and logistical problems.  Therefore no 
data for any variable from 9/1 00:00 through 9/11 8:30.  No turbidity data for the entire month 
since deployed sonde lacked a turbidity probe.  Sonde was out of the water for maintenance from 
09/30 09:30 through 23:30.  
	
TW:  No data until 9/29 9:30 when first deployment at T-wharf began.  No turbidity data for this 
month since turbidity probe in for repair.

October, 1996
PC:  Large negative turbidity numbers due to wiper post failure deleted for:
		10/13	11:00
		10/14 10:30 through 10/30 14:00
	
TW:  No data, any variable, from 10/20 9:30 through 10/22 12:00 due to servicing.  No turbidity 
data from 10/22 12:30 through end of month since no turbidity probe deployed.  There appears to be a DO
membrane puncture from 10/7 23:00 through 10/20 09:00; data were deleted.  

November, 1996
PC:  Dissolved oxygen data suddenly went negative (-99.9%) on 11/17 and remained at -99.9% until 11/27 
when a new sonde was deployed.  The -99.9% reading is indicative of internal probe failure and the 
data were deleted (see missing Data section).No data, any variable, on 11/27 at 9:00 and 9:30 due to 
servicing.  No turbidity data from 11/27 10:00 through end of month since deployed sonde had no 
turbidity probe.
	
TW:  No turbidity data from beginning of month until 11/20 9:30 due to lack of probe.

December, 1996
PC:  No turbidity data for entire month since deployed sonde lacked probe.

TW:  No sonde deployed from 12/12 14:00 through 12/24 9:30 due to stormy weather and 
logistical problems.  Turbidity data only collected for beginning of month (12/1 - 12/12).
