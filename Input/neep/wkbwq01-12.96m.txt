2.	Entry Verification (Done by J. Cowan):

	Data are uploaded to the PC from the Data loggers and graphs are produced using the PC6000 software.  Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from probe failure.  Notes are made of any unusual data, and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .prn files using the PC6000 software.  The .prn files are imported into EXCEL, edited by removing headers and footers, and saved as EXCEL files.  Data at the beginning and end of each data record that were recorded when the instruments were out of the water are deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document the times in and out of the water, and by unusual depth data (usually negative or near zero).  The appropriate files are merged to form complete monthly data sets and are saved as separate EXCEL files.  Data that are missing because the instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are denoted by periods (.).  These times are noted in section 12 (Missing Data) of this document  Two types of post-calibration values are also used to determine operational viability of the sensors while deployed.  One is obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values given by the Data loggers.  The second type is obtained in the field using a newly calibrated Hydrolab.  Data from this instrument are recorded in the field at the time of the last scheduled reading by the Data loggers.  Both post-calibration values are reported in section 13 (Other Remarks/Notes) of this document, and may be used to determine the quality of the data recorded by the instruments (particularly DO) after two weeks in the field.  Any erroneous data that are identified as being caused by probe failures (as determined upon examination of the data plots, or by post-calibration values) are deleted and replaced with periods, and noted in section 12 (Missing Data) of this document.  Sensor readings that greatly deviate from known values of standards after the two week deployment are not necessarily believed to be a result of probe failure, however.  If biofouling is believed to be the reason for poor agreement between the sensors and the standard values at the end of a deployment, the data are retained and noted in section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this document.  Symptoms of probe failures are extreme noise in the record, unrealistically high or negative data, or noisey or negative readings in standard solutions.  Examples of many such failures are given in the CDMO Manual (Version 3.0). .  Finally, the CDMO macros (update version 11/96) are then run on these new monthly files to identify missing times and/or dates, to format the width and decimal places of columns, and to identify outliers and other erroneous data.

3.	Research Objectives/Study Purpose:

	The Data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 minutes.  Presently, two instruments are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve.  One is located at the mouth of Fish River (provides ~73% of Weeks Bay’s freshwater), and the other is located the eastern side of Weeks Bay, near the mouth.
	Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon Secour Bay.  Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show that bottom waters (which flow into Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic in summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also in question, as largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during periods of high river flow.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if poor water quality periodically observed in Weeks Bay is generated within the bay proper, or is being washed in from Fish River or Bon Secour Bay with changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these two sites may be used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.

4.	Research Methods:

	Data loggers are moored on private docks.  At each dock, a PVC tube is attached to a piling at the end of the dock using ratchets equipped with zinc disks (to help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A chain, attached to the cap of the tube, is shackled to the bail of the Data logger.  Chains and tubes were cut to a length that places the Data logger probes just below the bottom of the tube and 0.5 m above the sediment when in place.  A nylon rope tied to the bottom of the piling also runs through the tube and is attached to the bale of the Data logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the Data loggers in the event that the tube breaks away from the piling.
	The Data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation and concentration, pH, and water level every 30 minutes (central standard time [CST]).  A newly calibrated Hydrolab is also used to record the above parameters at the same time the deployed YSI takes its first reading to insure initial accuracy of the YSI.  The instruments are usually serviced (instruments post-calibrated, data uploaded, instruments cleaned and recalibrated) every 14 days; however, they are programmed to log for 30 days in the event they cannot be serviced on schedule.  Just before deployment, window screening (1mm mesh size) is wrapped once around the cage that protects the sensors, and secured with plastic cable ties.  Window screening is also secured in the bottom of the cage with silicone sealant.  This is done to reduce error in the data that may be due to larger animals moving in and out of the cage during the deployment.  This does not, however, preclude smaller animals such as barnacle and polychaete larvae from entering the cage and settling on the sensors.
	Before the Data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated Hydrolab is lowered to the depth of the YSI instrument, and Hydrolab readings are logged at the same time that the YSI’s are programmed to record.  Post-
calibration values are obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values given by the Data loggers.
	Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as described in the YSI Operating Manual (addendum 7/94, sections 3, 4, and 7).  Calibration standards, required for pH and salinity, are purchased from a scientific supply house.  Dissolve oxygen is calibrated using a calibration cup filled with about ¼” of tap water, which creates a 100% water-saturated air environment for the sensors when the sonde is placed in the cup.  The sensors are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 minutes in the cup before DO (%Saturation) is calibrated.  Servicing the instruments results in a period of about 2 hours of missing data every two weeks at site FR, and a period of 3 to 4 hours of missing data every two weeks at site WB.

5.	Site Location and Character:

	Weeks Bay (30 23’ N, 87 50’ W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) runs nearly north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to the mouth, where water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near the center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side of Weeks Bay.  Average depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths are significantly greater.  The first is in the mouth of the bay, where the average depth is 6 m; the second is about 200 m upstream of the mouth of the Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally diurnal, and have a mean range of 0.4 m.
	The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 1.43 x 108 m2 and contributes approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow;  the Magnolia River supplies the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 m3 s-1; although freshets up to 4 times larger occur aperiodically throughout the year.  These characteristics result in a freshwater residence time of 13 days under average discharge conditions, with a range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  During periods of high river flow, salinities in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, except in the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  However, during periods of low river flow wind velocity and tidal stage are strong factors influencing salinity structure.  Salinities greater than 25 ppt are rarely observed in Weeks Bay, and are usually restricted to the southern portion of the estuary near the mouth.
	Site FR (Fish River; 30 25’00” N, 87 49’24” W) is located at the mouth of Fish River at a mean depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there are small patches of Vallisineria, spp. growing near (but not directly under) the Data logger.  Land use in the water shed is largely agricultural, with some residential use.  Directly surrounding the site, land use is largely public and semi-public.  Nutrient concentrations at this site are variable and may be quite high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations ranging from approximately 4-90 µM and <0.5 to 7.5 µM, respectively, over the previous 10 years (Alabama Department of Environmental Management).  Over the past year, salinity ranged from 0.0 to 16.5 ppt at this site.
	Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 22’52” N, 87 49’57” W) is located near the south-eastern shore of the Weeks Bay, about 0.5 miles from the mouth of the estuary.  Mean water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land use around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture occurring inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at site FR; over the past year, nitrate and phosphate concentrations here ranged from 0.1 to 42 µM and 0.04 to 0.45 µM, respectively.  Salinity ranged from approximately 0 to 22 ppt over the past year.  
6.	Data Collection Periods:

	The Data loggers were first deployed at both sites on 27 October 1995, and have been continuously in service since then.

7.	Associated Researchers and Projects:

	Weeks Bay Reserve established twenty-four volunteer water quality monitoring sites in the watershed in May 1995.  These sites are monitored once every two weeks for fecal coliform counts, secchi depth, DO concentration, temperature, pH, alkalinity, hardness, and at some sites salinity.

* = Please note #2 in General Information.

General Information:
1.	While we have always set the Data loggers to record 2 times per hour, we have changed logging times over the course of the past year.  Because a ferry is used to reach the sites, we tried several logging intervals (logging at 00:00 and 30:00, then at 05:00 and 35:00 past the hour) before we came to the final interval that best fits the ferry schedule.  We have settled on logging at 15:00 and 45:00 past the hour, and have done so regularly since 24 April 1996.

2.	We have deleted data only when technical difficulties resulted in questionable data.  Therefore, we feel that extreme caution should be used when evaluating these data (especially DO % sat. and concentration) because of problems with biofouling.  Particularly during the summer months, biofouling can cause severe degradation of the DO and conductivity calibrations over the two week deployments (eg: 07/18/96 site WB).  At times the DO deviation from calibration at the end of a two week deployment was greater than 80% ( in a water-saturated air environment).  We have made note of any data that we consider to be suspect because of biofouling, based on post-calibration values reported by the sensors.  We also have provided the Hydrolab readings that were taken in the field at the time of the final logging interval before retrieval of the YSI’s, as well as the post-calibration values (for details see section 4, above) in section 13 (Other Remarks/Notes) below.  We encourage anyone using the YSI data to first compare them to these Hydrolab and post-calibration values on the given dates before evaluating the data.  If the user desires, it is possible to use these data to correct the YSI data using regression analysis.  If not, then the user should delete compromised data at his or her own discretion.

Five days into deployment, there was a sudden drop in battery voltage, resulting in probe failure.  Volt-meter showed that two renewals in this unit were negatively polarized at the end of the deployment.  The company says this is common at the end of a battery’s life.
