2.	Entry verification:
	The data are downloaded from  the YSI 6000s to an IBM  compatible PC.  Graphs of all data 
are printed using PC6000 software and are examined for suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  
Files are converted to Macintosh Excel files and edited for transfer to the NERRS CDMO.  
Files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Missing data (from maintenance and 
downloading down time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by  a period (.).  
Suspect data are deleted and replaced by periods(.).  After formatting the data, files are more 
closely checked for anomolies in DeltaGraph Pro®.  Edited and raw files are archived on a 
Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR.

3.	Research Objectives:
	The Bay View Channel YSI 6000  has been set out to detect and monitor short term variability 
and long-term changes in Padilla Bay.  The Joe Leary Slough YSI 6000  has been set at the 
mouth of the slough to measure the effects of  tidal "closure" of the tide gates on water in the 
slough and to detect long-term changes in water quality in the slough associated with 
implementation of a watershed action plan.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes at both 
sites unless otherwise noted in data anomalies.

4.	Research methods:
	During June and July, 1995, a YSI 6000 was deployed in Joe Leary Slough using a crab trap 
which held it in a horizontal position 0.25 m above the bottom.   

	In August, the deployment of the YSI 6000 in Joe Leary Slough was changed, so that it is held 
vertically 0.25 m above the bottom of the slough in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe which has holes 
and slits drilled in it to allow water circulation around the probes.  The PVC pipe is attached to 
a steel pipe which was driven into the sediment.

	In September 1995, a YSI 6000 was deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview 
Channel.  It was deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, except that the 
PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes.  The depth of the YSI 6000 was -1.1 m (depth 
below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a small channel 
draining the surronding intertidal flats.

	In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, 
dissolved oxygen, depth and pH are recorded every half hour.  At the end of each sampling 
period, the YSI 6000 is brought back into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and re-
calibration.   

	All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 6000 Operation and Service 
Manual.  For the conductivity calibration a 10 mS/cm conductivity standard is used.  The pH 
calibration is a 2 point calibration using standard pH buffer solutions with a pH of 7 and 10.  
The KCl solution and teflon membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to 
each YSI 6000 deployment and the new oxygen membrane is allowed to soak overnight in 
water before calibration.
	
5.	Site location and character:
	General:  Padilla Bay (48 deg 30' N; 122 deg 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern 
Puget Sound.  The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass, Zostera marina, which covers 
approximately 3,000 ha.  Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, now covers about 
350 ha of the bay.  Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with a mean range of 1.55m.  Salinity varies 
from about 15 to 30 o/oo.  

	Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer empties directly into it.  
Most of the land in the Padilla Bay watershed is agricultural, and  is drained by four sloughs 
which empty into the bay.  Padilla Bay also receives fresh water from the Fraser and Nooksack 
Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River to the south.  These rivers flow into Puget Sound 
and the Strait of Georgia in which Padilla Bay  is located.

	Joe Leary Slough Site:  (48 deg 31' 05" N;  122 deg 28' 25" W) Joe Leary Slough drains land 
which is predominantly agricultural with some pasture land.  The slough is characterized by 
high fecal and nutrient inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  
During the summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.25-1.5 m.  During winter 
flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m.   There is a dam at the mouth of the slough with 
twelve  4 ft diameter outfall pipes that have one-way hinged  tide gates.   Saline water from 
Padilla Bay seeps through the tide gates during high tide. The bottom of the slough is 
composed of very soft sediment, which is periodically dredged.  A YSI 6000 is deployed on 
the freshwater side of the tide gates at a depth of 0.25 m above the bottom.  

	Bayview Channel Site:  (48 deg 29' 47" N;  122 deg 30' 07" W) Bayview Channel, a major 
Padilla Bay tributary, drains intertidal flats including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and 
flats without macrovegetation.  The YSI 6000 is located in a major tributary channel to 
Bayview Channel.  The tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. 
japonica) covered intertidal flats.  Bottom sediments beneath the YSI 6000 are fine silt and clay 
overlying sand.  Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point source, agricultural non-
point source, and fecal coliforms from agriculture, failing septics and wildlife.

6.	Data collection period:
	Intermittant data collection in Joe Leary Slough (JL) during June to August, 1995:
	June 8-15, June 22-26, and June 30
	July 1-5 and July 7- 21
	August 22-31
	Continuous data collection began August 22, 1995 in Joe Leary Slough (JL) and September 6, 
1995 in the Bay View Channel in Padilla Bay (BY).
	 

7.	Associated researchers and projects:
	At the Joe Leary Slough site, weekly  (from April 1995 to December 1995) water samples were 
collected and the concentration of inorganic nutrients, suspended solids, and turbidity were 
measured by staff at Padilla Bay NERR and the Washington State Dept Ecology Manchester 
Environmental Laboratory.

Negative depth values are recorded because of changes in barometric pressure between the time 
of calibration and the time at which depth is measured.
Data columns are separated by tabs.


9.	Coded variable code definitions:

JL - Joe Leary Slough Site;  BY - Bayview Channel Site
File definitions:  YSI deployment site/month/year  (e.g. JL1195 = data from Joe Leary Slough 
site during November, 1995)


10.	Data anomalies:

Negative depths are recorded by the depth sensors because of changes in the barometric 
pressure between the time of calibration and the time that depth is measured.  
Because the Joe Leary Slough site is so shallow, the apparent depth is recorded as 
negative at times throughout the time that the sondes were deployed.

June 1995: 
	JL:  From 1130 to 1700 on 22 June specific conductivity and salinity were 0 for both 
parameters.  This was probably caused by air getting trapped in the conductivity 
probe when the YSI was deployed.  The data were deleted (see Missing data).


September 1995
JL:  The depth sensor was not correctly calibrated so the depth data from 0930 on 13 
Sep to 2330 on 30 Sep were deleted (see Missing data section).
pH values changed abruptly at 2130 on 26 Sep and the probe was apparently 
cracked on retrieval of the YSI 6000.  pH data from 2130 on 26 Sep to 2330 
on 30 Sep were deleted (see Missing data section).

October 1995
JL:  On October 5 and October 9 - 14 periods of low dissolved oxygen (< 5% 
saturation) were recorded each day in Joe Leary Slough.  From October 15 
through 31, the dissolved oxygen values were less than 1% saturation most of 
the time.  The low dissolved oxygen in Joe Leary Slough was associated with 
black colored water and high fecal coliforms, possibly from dairy waste 
upstream in the watershed.
pH probe was cracked; pH data from 0000 1 Oct through 2330 31 Oct were deleted 
(see Missing data section).
The depth sensor was not correctly calibrated so the depth data from 0000 on 1 Oct 
through 2330 on 31 Oct were deleted (see Missing data section).
BY:  The cause for the low and fluctuating dissolved oxygen from 2000 on 16 Oct 
through 0030 on 17 Oct is not known.

November 1995
JL:  From 0030 on November 1 through 1300 on November 8 the dissolved oxygen 
values were less than 1% saturation most of the time.  The low dissolved oxygen 
in Joe Leary Slough was associated with black colored water and high fecal 
coliforms, possibly from dairy waste upstream in the watershed.
pH probe was cracked; pH data from 0000 1 Nov through 2330 30 Nov were 
deleted (see Missing data section).
The depth sensor was not correctly calibrated so the depth data from 0000 on 1 Nov 
through 2330 on 30 Nov were deleted (see Missing data section).
No data for all parameters except depth from 1445 on Nov 28 to 2345 on 30 Nov 
because the bottom of the probes were apparently covered in sediment (see 
Missing data section).  Depth data were not removed because the depth sensor 
is located high on the probe and there was no evidence that the depth sensor 
was affected by the sediment.

December 1995
JL:  The low dissolved oxygen data from 2100 on 30 Dec to 2330 on 31 Dec were not 
independently confirmed.
No data for all parameters except depth from 0000 1 Dec to 0815 on 14 Dec 
because the bottom of the probes were apparently covered in sediment (see 
Missing data section).  Depth data were not removed because the depth sensor 
is located high on the probe and there was no evidence that the depth sensor 
was affected by the sediment.
pH probe was cracked; pH data from 0000 1 Dec through 2330 31 Dec were 
deleted (see Missing data section).

BY:  Anamolous low and fluctuating dissolved oxygen data were observed from 0500 
on 22Dec95 through 1500 on 29Dec95; the cause for these low values is not 
known and dissolved oxygen data throughout this time period is supect.


11.	Missing data:

January to May 1995: YSI 6000's were not deployed at either site
