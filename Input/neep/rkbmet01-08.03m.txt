2) Entry verification

a)	Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded from each instrument 
on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program 
(nerr30.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection schedule 
(see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then 
interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific. This software was located 
on a laptop computer to which the data was downloaded approximately every two weeks.  The data 
was saved as a monthly raw data file (RAW 0100.dat) onto a separate hard drive and backed up onto 
the Rookery Bay NERR Lab server.  

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) is used 
to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic to interface 
with the NERR Meteorological Data Collection Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for 
the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly raw data 
file into and Access database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts 
the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access database.  Secondly, it checks the data 
against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Appendix G of the CDMO Operations Manual version 
4 for the CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data Criteria).  Finally, it produces 
error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in the Anomalous 
Data Section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction Section below.  

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria, 
temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15 minute period, and precipitation difference of 
greater than 5mm in 15 minutes.  All errors of these types were double checked with other data 
that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted in the sections that follow.  

Gemteck's EQwin version 5 and the CDMO developed Microsoft Excel EQWinFormat.xls macro now replaces 
the WDMP as the NERR MET database management program and primary QA/QC program. 

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

For data collection, the CR10X datalogger was programmed to collect data in the 
following formats:

i)	15-minute data are collected instantaneously for Air Temperature (C), 
Relative Humidity (%), Barometric Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and 
Wind Direction (degrees).  15-minute Precipitation (mm) and PAR 
(mmol/m^2) data are totaled from 5-second readings, prior to NERR_4.CSI

ii)	15-minute average, maximum and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb) and Wind Speed (m/s) with NERR_4.CSI.

iii)	Hourly average, maximum, and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Hourly 
totals for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute 
readings.

iv)	Daily average, maximum and minumum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Daily totals 
for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute readings.

Data were stored on a Campbell Scientific storage module (SM192 or SM4M), which 
was retrieved monthly.  The data were downloaded and pre-processed as described in 
Section 2.  QA/QC of the data was conducted using either the WDMP or EQWin.  
WDMP error reports and EQWin queries were based on the following anomalous data 
criteria:

Air Temp:
- 15 min sample not greater than max for the day
- 15 min sample not less than the min for the day
- 15 min sample not greater than 3.0 C from the previous 15 minutes (WDMP only)
- Max and min temp recorded for the day (WDMP only)
- 1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the 
hour (WDMP only)
-Sample not greater than 50 C or less than –30 C (EQWin only)

Relative Humidity:
-Not changed by more than 25% from the previous 15 minutes (WDMP only)
-Max and min humidity recorded for the day (WDMP only)
-1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the   
hour (WDMP only)
-Sample not greater than 100% or less than 0% (EQWin only)

Pressure:
- Pressure not greater than 1040 mb or less than 980 mb (WDMP only)
- Pressure changes greater than 5 mb per hour (WDMP only)
- Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day (WDMP only)

- Wind speed not greater than 65 m/s or less than 0.5 m/s (WDMP only)
-Wind speed not greater than 30 m/s (EQWin only)
-Wind speed not less than 0.5 m/s for 12 consecutive hours (EQWin only)

Wind Direction:
- Wind direction not greater than 360 degrees or less than 0 degrees

Rainfall:
- Precipitation not greater than 5 mm in 15 min
- No precipitation for the month (WDMP only)

Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR):
 -Sample not greater than 5000 mmol/m^2 or less than –0.5 mmol/m^2

Time:

For all data:
- No duplicate data	


3) Research objectives (Campbell Weather Station):

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for Rookery Bay in order 
to observe any environmental changes or trends over time.  Secondary objectives include using 
the meteorological data to help document periodic biological and environmental events such as:  
fish kills, red tides, wildfires, prescribed burns, and hurricanes/tropical storms.  It also 
supports all research conducted at the reserve including providing valuable ancillary data for 
the reserve's water quality monitoring program.


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and 
daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, 
rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and 
that data is stored in array 150 (with the nerr30.csi program).   The data is downloaded at the 
storage module to a laptop and brought back to the lab for uploading following procedures in 
Part D. Section 4.5 of the CDMO Operations Manual version 4.  Periodically, sensors on the weather station 
are inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned.  The rain 
gauge tends to collect the most debris and needs to be cleaned out every few days.  Sensors are 
removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at minimum of every two years.  
There were no other analyses done on the meteorological data at present.  


5) Site location and character:

Rookery Bay's weather station is located at our Shell Island Road Laboratory which is adjacent to 
the mouth of Henderson Creek (where the creek enters Rookery Bay).

Latitude:	26° 01.492' N
Longitude:	81° 43.895' W

Rookery Bay is located in the Tropical Rainy climatic group of Koppen (1931), i.e. the area below 
a west-east line extending from Ft. Myers to Melbourne, and where the mean temperature does not 
fall below 17.7°C (64°F) in the coolest month of the year.  Owing to the influence of the warm-water 
Florida Current, the seasonal effects from the Gulf of Mexico Loop Current, and its geographical 
position at 26° N latitude, the average annual temperature in the Rookery Bay  area is about 24°C 
(75°F).  Winter temperatures range from -1°C (ca. 30°F) to about 26°C (75°F), with cooler days and 
nights (10-15°C) in the months of January and February.  Warming trends in April and May are frequently 
modified by blustery winds from the southwest off the Gulf of Mexico, and by late season cold fronts 
with northerly breezes.  Summer high temperatures approach 35°C (95°F) or higher on occasion (Thomas 1974).

Rookery Bay and vicinity have an annual rainfall of 50-55 inches (127-140cm) per year (Thomas 1974).  
The heaviest average monthly rainfall, 8-9 inches per month, occurs from June through September.  
Lowest average rainfall, 1-2 inches per month, occurs from November through March.  Approximately 
66% of the total yearly rainfall occurs between the months of June and October.  Southwest Florida 
lies in the seasonal tropical weather belt that channels hurricanes toward or along the coast.  
Historically, the area is fortunate in that few severe hurricanes have come ashore.

The weather station is located at Rookery Bay's lab facilities with the Wind Sentry, Temperature 
and Humidity sensor, Barometric Sensor and LiCor sensor all located on an approximately 6m aluminum 
tower following the descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual Version 4.  The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge 
is located to the east away from the tower on the roof of the lab building.  The sensors were wired 
to the CR10X following the protocol in the CDMO Manual version 4.  


6) Data collection period:

Weather data have been collected at the Henderson Creek site since 1996.  The current SWMP weather 
station has been fully operational since September 19, 2001. 2003 data were collected from January 1, 
2003 through July 2003 at which time the weather station was forced to change locations.  


7) Distribution:

According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy for the NERRS System-wide 
Monitoring Program,

NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of the NERRS System-wide 
Monitoring Program data.  The PI retains the right to be fully credited for having collected and

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project also has a station located on Henderson Creek.  The 
principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data for Rookery Bay 
in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water quality over time.  Four sites were 
chosen, one reference nearly pristine location, Fakahatchee Bay, and three other sites representing 
various degrees of watershed hydrologic alteration.  Relative to historic freshwater flows into 
these estuaries, Faka Union Bay receives far greater freshwater, Henderson creek receives less 
total freshwater but increased freshwater during the late rainy season and Blackwater River receives 
less total freshwater.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes at the Henderson Creek, Blackwater 
River, Faka Union Bay and Fakahatchee Bay sites.  The loggers are deployed for two week intervals 
before exchanged with a clean/calibrated instrument.

A long term fish survey is also done in Fakahatchee Bay, Faka Union Bay, Pumpkin Bay and the 
Henderson Creek site monthly.  Species present, species number and standard lengths are recorded 
at four randomly selected sites surrounding the water quality stations.  Benthic macro-invertebrates 
are collected near oyster bars using Hester-Dendy collection devices at the four water quality 
stations also.
