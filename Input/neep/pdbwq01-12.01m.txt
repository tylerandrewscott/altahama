2) Entry verification:

The data are downloaded from the YSI 6000s or 6600s to a Windows based PC. 
Graphs of all data are printed using EcoWatch software and are examined for 
suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  Notes are made of any unusual data. The 
files are then exported as .csv files and the CDMO macros are used for final 
formatting and a second check for outliers and missing data. Macros distributed 
by the CDMO are designed to: a) check data files for missing data points; b) 
fill all cells that do not contain data with periods; c) convert the data 
columns to the CDMO approved formats for time, date and numeric variables; d) 
find all data that are out of acceptable range for the sensors and save the 
anomalous data to an outlier file; e) save the files as Excel worksheets and f) 
generate single parameter monthly graphs. After formatting the data, some files 
are more closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro(r). Edited and raw 
files 
are archived on a PC hard drive and on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay 
NERR. The process of entry verification for the 2001 data was completed by 
Robin Cottrell. Robin Cottrell and Douglas Bulthuis completed final verification 
and metadata documentation.


3) Research objectives:

The Bay View Channel (BY) site was established to detect and monitor short-term 
variability and long-term changes in the south end of Padilla Bay. The Ploeg 
Channel (BP) site has been set out to monitor short-term variability and long-
term change in the north end of Padilla Bay and to contrast and compare water 
quality to the south end. The Joe Leary Slough (JL) site has been set at the 
mouth of the slough to measure the effects of tidal "closure" of the tide gates 
on water in the slough and to detect long-term changes in water quality in the 
slough associated with the implementation of a non point source pollution 
watershed action plan. Measurements are taken every 30 minutes at all sites 
unless otherwise noted in data anomalies. 

4) Research methods:

YSI 6000's or 6600's were deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical position, 
1.7 m from the bottom of the slough in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe with a metal 
bar secured horizontally at the bottom of the pipe as a stop. That portion of 
pipe around the sensors is cut out so that only two one-inch wide strips of 
deployment pipe remain around the sensor guard to allow water circulation around 
the probes. The PVC pipe is attached to a steel pipe that was driven into the 
sediment. (This slough was dredged in the fall of 2000 so the area of deployment 
is much deeper than it had been the previous 5 years. To keep the data 
comparable the YSI is deployed at the same height relative to Mean Sea Level.) 

YSI 6000's or 6600's were deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview 
Channel. They were deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, 
except that the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes. The depth of the YSI 
was -1.1 m (depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the 
sloping edge of a small channel draining the surrounding intertidal flats. After 
weeks of lost dissolved oxygen data due to damaged membranes, a sensor protector 
was made out of "Gutter Guard", a plastic 1/4" mesh material that was formed 
into a cylinder to fit inside the sensor guard to keep marine fauna from 
interfering with operation of the sensors. This was used in all the deployments 
at this site beginning in April.

YSI 6000's or 6600's were deployed in Ploeg Channel using the same design as 
that in Bayview Channel. The depth of the YSI was about -1.5 m (depth below 
MLLW) and about 0.6 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a channel 
draining the surrounding intertidal flats. As in Bayview Channel (described 
above) a sensor protector made out of "Gutter Guard", a plastic 1/4" mesh 
material, was used in all the deployments at this site.


In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, 
percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth, pH and turbidity are recorded 
every half hour. At the end of each deployment, the YSI 6000 or 6600 is brought 
back into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Before 
final cleaning and recalibration a post-deployment check is done that consists 
of recording sensor readings in the standard solutions. The results of these 
checks are used to help evaluate the validity of the logged data, and are posted 
in Section 13 of this document.

All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 
Environmental Operations Manual for the 6-Series Environmental Monitoring 
Systems. For the conductivity calibration, a conductivity standard of 50 mS/cm 
was used. The pH calibration is a 2-point calibration using standard buffer 
solutions with a pH of 7 and 10. The KCl solution and Teflon membrane on the 
dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6000 or 6600 deployment and 
the new oxygen membrane is allowed to stabilize overnight in water saturated air 
before calibration. A 2-point calibration is used for the turbidity probe. The 
standards used are distilled/deionized water for zero and 4000 NTU Formazin 
solution diluted to 100 NTU.


5) Site location and character:

General: Padilla Bay (48º 30' N; 122º 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern 
Puget Sound. The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera marina, which 
covers approximately 3,000 ha. Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, 
now covers about 350 ha of the bay. Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with a mean 
range of 1.55 m. Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU. 

Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer empties 
directly into it. Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed is 
agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay. The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located. Major 
freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary come 
from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River to 
the south.

Joe Leary Slough Site: (48º 31' 05.3" N; 122º 28' 22.8" W) Joe Leary Slough 
drains land that is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture land with 
some low-density housing. The slough is characterized by high fecal and nutrient 
inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations. During the 
summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m. During winter 
flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m. There is a dam at the mouth of 
the slough with twelve 4 ft. diameter outfall pipes that have one-way 
hinged tide gates. Upstream water flows out of Joe Leary Slough when water 
height in Padilla Bay is lower than water height in Joe Leary Slough (i.e. 
ebbing tide and low water). Some saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through the 
tide gates during high water. The bottom of the slough is composed of very soft 
sediment, which is periodically dredged, most recently October 2000. The 
deployment site is on the freshwater side of the tide gates. The 
latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and 
differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated 
accuracy of ± 5m.

Bayview Channel Site: (48º 29' 46.6" N; 122º 30' 01.8" W) Bayview Channel, a 
major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macro-vegetation. 
The YSI 6000 or 6600 is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel. The 
tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) covered 
intertidal flats. Depth range at this site is about 2 - 5 meters from MLLW to 
MHHW. Bottom sediments beneath the deployment site are fine silt and 
clay overlying sand. Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point 
source, agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from 
agriculture, failing septic tanks and wildlife. The latitude/longitude were 
measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and differentially corrected with post 
processing providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 5 m.

Ploeg Channel Site: (48º 33' 23.5" N; 122º 31' 46.7" W) Ploeg Channel floods and 
drains intertidal flats at the north end of Padilla Bay that are comprised of 
mud flats and eelgrass beds (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) in approximately 
equal amounts. Depth range at this site is about 2 - 5 meters from MLLW to MHHW. 
Bottom sediments beneath the deployment site are fine to medium 
sands. The Ploeg Channel site was added to the sites being monitored as part of 
the Padilla Bay NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program in July 2001 as part of the 
SWMP expansion. The Ploeg Channel site was selected to extend the geographic 
coverage and to indicate if there is a north to south gradient in water quality 
in Padilla Bay. A fourth site will be added in 2002 in the deep channel west of 
Ploeg Channel. At that time the Ploeg Channel site will be one site along a 
gradient from fresh water sources to marine sources of water to Padilla Bay. 
Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point source, agricultural non-
point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from agriculture, failing septic tanks 
and wildlife. The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II 
and differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's 
stated accuracy of ± 5 m.

11) Data anomalies:

January 1-31, 2001
Bayview Channel
During the following periods salinity and specific conductivity data were 
abnormally low so they were deleted, it was probably because the probe orifice 
was packed with debris: 
01/01/2001 00:00:00 - 01/23/2001 14:00:00 
All dissolved oxygen and pH data were deleted for the month due to the following 
reasons: 
The logger at this site was switched on 01/23/2001 but the DO membrane was 
damaged during both deployments (probably by crustaceans found in the sensor 
guard). The pH values through 01/23/2001 showed an abrupt drop and subsequent 
erratic record that corresponded with change in DO and salinity. The next pH 
probe installed through the end of the month was found to be bad after 
retrieval. 
In the following records the turbidity values were deleted, they were high and 
erratic, cause unknown:
01/12/2001 23:00:00
01/28/2001 11:00:00
01/29/2001 09:00:00, 11:00:00

Joe Leary
From January 1, 00:00:00 to January 16, 13:00:00 the logger was deployed about 
6" above the bottom of the deployment pipe because the chain securing it was too 
short. This resulted in the logger being positioned above the large cutouts in 
the deployment pipe that allow free flow of water around the sensors. Data 
collected during this period should be interpreted with caution.
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic (probably due 
to debris caught in the pipe obscuring the sensor) so they were deleted:
01/05/2001	20:30:00 - 21:00:000
1/07/2001	18:30:00 - 01/16/2001	  13:00:00
The following records include zero or slightly negative depth readings, the data 
were not deleted because salinity and dissolved oxygen data indicate the sensors 
were submerged:
01/29/2001	01:30:00 - 03:00:00

February 1 - 28, 2001
Bayview Channel
All dissolved oxygen and pH data were deleted for the month due to a bad pH 
probe and damaged DO membrane.
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
02/03/2001	17:30:00
02/09/2001	17:00:00
02/10/2001	15:30:00
02/12/2001	04:30:00
02/15/2001	02:30:00
02/28/2001	18:00:00

Joe Leary
None

March 1 - 31, 2001
Bayview Channel
During the following periods dissolved oxygen and pH data were deleted due to a 
damaged DO membrane and bad pH probe.
03/01/2001	00:00:00 - 03/23/2001    15:30:00
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
03/01/2001	00:30:00
03/06/2001	05:00:00
03/22/2001	06:00:00, 14:00:00, 20:00:00	
03/26/2001	12:00:00
Small negative turbidities (<-1.0 NTU) were recorded during the following 
periods probably due to small calibration error:
03/24/2001	06:00:000, 7:00:00, 07:30:00
03/28/2001	22:00:00, 20:30:00		
03/29/2001	21:00:00
03/30/2001	23:30:00
No data were collected during the following period because loggers were being 
switched at this time: 
03/23/2001	16:00:00

Joe Leary
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
03/17/2001	12:00:00
03/25/2001	10:30:00 - 03/28/2001    13:30:00
There is no pH data for the following deployment time because there was no probe 
installed in the logger:
03/28/2001	14:00:00 - 03/31/2001    23:30:00

April 1 - 30, 2001
Bayview Channel
This was the first deployment using "Gutter Guard", a plastic 1/4" mesh that is 
formed into a cylinder to fit inside the sensor guard to keep marine fauna from 
interfering with operation of the sensors. It appeared to work, as there was no 
dissolved oxygen membrane damage during this deployment.
Small negative turbidity (<-1.0 NTU) was recorded during the following period 
probably due to a small calibration error:
04/02/2001	01:30:00
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
04/15/2001	17:00:00
04/27/2001	19:30:00

Joe Leary
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted; 4/09 through 4/12 anomalous data were due to biofouling of the logger:
04/09/2001	23:00:00 - 04/12/2001     09:30:00
04/29/2001	13:30:00
There is no pH data for the following times because there was no probe installed 
in the logger for that deployment:
04/01/2001	00:00:00 - 04/12/2001      09:30:00
Dissolved oxygen data were deleted for the following period because the data 
were unreliable, the probe was found to be bad when it could not be calibrated 
after deployment:
04/19/2001	15:00:00 - 04/30/2001	     23:30:00
From April 25 to 27 salinity values >20 ppt, pH> 8 and turbidity values <20 NTU 
all indicate something may have been caught in one or more of the tide gates so 
it could not completely close at high tide. This would allow marine water to 
flow into the fresh water side of the slough.

During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:

During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
05/02/2001	07:00:00
05/30/2001	10:30:00
The following records have elevated turbidities that are probably due to storm 
events:
05/01/2001	19:00:00 - 19:30:00
05/03/2001	16:30:00 - 17:30:00
05/19/2001	07:00:00
Dissolved oxygen data were deleted for the following periods because the data 
were suspect, the probe could not be calibrated after this deployment so it was 
replaced:
05/01/2001	00:00:00 - 05/08/2001     14:00:00
Dissolved oxygen values from the deployment beginning 5/8 at 14:30 and running 
to 5/21 at 14:30 has a downward trend, most evident in the last 4-5 days, which 
may be due to fouling of the probe. The last DO value at 14:30 was 19% and the 
first value on the new logger at 15:00 was 55.9%. The probe was operating 
properly in the post-deployment check. Low DO values are not uncommon at this 
site (<30%) but the data from the last few days of this deployment should be 
interpreted with caution.

The lowest recorded depths (< 0.1 m) this month occurred during the following 
dates and times, they correspond to the lowest tides of the year, -3.3' and -
3.4' respectively. Salinity and dissolved oxygen data indicate the sensors 
remained submerged.
06/22/2001	11:00:00, 11:30:00

Joe Leary
During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
07/05/2001	07:30:00
07/07/2001	09:00:00
During the following period the pH value was deleted because it was high and 
erratic. The loggers were switched close to the sample time and the probe 
probably did not have time to equilibrate at the site before a reading was made. 
The values recorded before and after this time on the two different loggers are 
the same.
07/10/2001	14:00:00

Ploeg Channel
The following times turbidity reported a negative value and/or a zero value:
7/1/2001	9:30:00
7/4/2001	11:30:00
7/8/2001	22:00:00
7/9/2001	1:00:00 - 5:00:00
Most of the records during the following time span contain small negative 
turbidity readings (<-2.0 NTU). These are probably due to a calibration error 
because there were no more negative turbidity readings after this logger was 
replaced.
7/10/2001	9:30:00 - 7/27/2001	11:00:00
During the following period, dissolved oxygen data were deleted because upon 
retrieval, a barnacle was discovered growing in the middle of the DO membrane. 
There was no obvious indication in the data record of when it attached so all 
the DO data for this deployment were considered unreliable and deleted.
07/27/2001	11:30:00 - 07/31/2001    23:30:00


August 1 - 31, 2001
Bayview Channel
Small negative turbidities (<-1.0 NTU) were recorded during the following 
periods probably due to small calibration error:
08/01/2001	19:00:00
08/07/2001	05:30:00
During the following period turbidity data were over 1000 NTU due to probe 
failure (the wiper parked over the optic port and stayed there) so they were 
deleted: 
08/13/2001	16:00:00 - 08/30/2001	    14:30:00

09/16/2001	05:30:00, 23:30:00
09/23/2001	05:30:00
During the following time period all the data were deleted because the sonde was 
not deployed at the correct depth as indicated by shallow depth and low salinity 
readings. The instrument was apparently temporarily hung up on something inside 
the deployment tube because the midnight reading on 09/21/2001 was taken at the 
correct depth.
09/20/2001	08:30:00 - 23:30:00

9/13/2001	21:30:00
9/14/2001	1:30:00
9/15/2001	1:00:00
Most of the records during the following time span contain small negative 
turbidity readings (<-1.0 NTU). These are probably due to a calibration error 
because they only appear in the data from one logger:
9/20/2001	13:30:00 - 9/29/2001	17:30:00
During the following time period salinity (and therefore specific conductivity) 
was low and erratic so it was deleted, 
cause unknown: 
09/26/2001	09:00:00 - 20:00:00
Dissolved oxygen (mg/L) during this time period 09/26/2001 09:00:00 - 20:00:00 
were also deleted due to slightly high (< 0.2 mg/L higher) values because the 
calculation of that value is partly based on salinity, which was reading about 
2.0 to 2.5 ppt lower during this period than the days before and after.

October 1 - 31, 2001
Bayview Channel
During the following time period salinity and specific conductivity were low and 
erratic so it was deleted, cause unknown:
10/02/2001	01:00:00 - 03:00:00
Dissolved oxygen values in mg/L during this time period will be slightly high (< 
0.2 mg/L higher) because the calculation of that value is partly based on 
salinity, which was reading about 2.0 ppt lower during this period than the days 
before and after.
High turbidities and low salinities October 22 through October 24 correspond 
with strong winds, up to 39.4 mph, and low tides. 

Joe Leary
High turbidities beginning on dates October 19, 25, 27 and 31 correspond to rain 
events, more than 5.5 inches of rainfall for this month.

Ploeg Channel
High turbidities from October 22 - 24 coincide with a storm event with winds up 
to 39.4 mph.
Records during the following time span contain small negative turbidity readings 
(<1.0 NTU). These are probably due to a calibration error because they only 
appear in the data from one logger:
10/01/01 10:00:00 - 10/21/01 07:30:00.


November 1 - 30, 2001

During the following periods turbidity data were high and erratic so they were 
deleted, cause unknown:
11/07/2001	04:30:00
11/13/2001	23:30:00
The following time period includes many small negative turbidity readings (< -2 
NTU). These negative readings are probably due to a calibration error because 
they only appear in the data from one logger:
11/24/2001	11:30:00 - 11/29/2001     08:00:00
High turbidities beginning on the 14th and on the 20th of November are probably 
due to storm events, wind maximum on the 14th was 43.1 mph and on the 20th 41.7 
mph.

No data were collected during the following period because loggers were being 
switched at this time: 
12/19/2001	14:30:00
High turbidities and low-tide low salinities on December 13 - 18 correspond to a 
storm event in which nearly 2 inches of rain fell and winds reached 43.4 mph.

Joe Leary
During the following period turbidity was high and erratic so it was deleted, 
cause unknown:
12/17/2001	18:30:00

storm event in which nearly 2 inches of rain fell and winds reached 43.4 mph.

12) Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14) Other Remarks/notes

a) Major rain and/or storm events are noted in section 11, Data anomalies.
b) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
