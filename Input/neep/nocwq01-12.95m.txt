2)Entry Verification Process:

The data are reviewed using the computer program PC6000 that
accompanies the YSI 6000 datalogger or Microsoft Excel for
Hydrolab DataSonde 3 data. After the file is uploaded from the
water quality instrument, PC6000 is used to plot the data and
perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.
dev.). This information is printed out and attached to the Field
Log for the particular deployment. This printout is used during
file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when
the water quality instrument was removed from the water or those
caused by instrument failure. The data are imported into a
Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative
recordings. When a complete month of data has been recorded the
file is ready for review. The data review includes several steps.
The first step is to format the data so that the parameter
columns are in the correct order and the data have the correct
number of decimal place holders. Secondly, an Excel macro is used
to check for any dates and times that data were not recorded due
to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates
and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted
into the cells where data would normally be. An explanation for
the missing data is recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.
Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro to find readings
outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range
for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are
removed from the file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).
An explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto
the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside the "normal" range of
water quality for a particular site were investigated for
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks,
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics. If the data are
rejected from the file a period is inserted into the cell(s) and
an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto
the Water Quality Editing Log. The information recorded on the
Water Quality Editing Log is transferred to the metadata form.
The metadata form is then submitted with the data file to the
CDMO.  Paul Grimshaw reviewed and edited 1995 data.  


3)Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island
and Zeke's Island components of North Carolina's National
Estuarine Research Reserve and are anchored to the bottom of the
selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30 minute intervals for
approximately two week periods. Before a formal protocol was
established for NERR water quality monitoring, hourly data at
Masonboro and Zeke's Island were recorded as detailed in section
13. These sites are relatively unimpacted by manmade
perturbations. 


4)Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March
1992 at the Masonboro Island component, and 19 May 1994 at the
Zeke's Island component. The procedures described below were
instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover data recorded
previously. At this time we are only performing long term water
quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6000 or Hydrolab DataSonde 3 are deployed,
calibration and maintenance is performed following the
manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections
3,4, and 7 and Hydrolab Manual Revision B 4/91, part 3). 
Calibration standards are only required for pH and salinity; all
other parameters are done as described in the manual. Buffer
solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased
premade from a scientific supply house. The salinity standard is
obtained from filtered seawater taken from Masonboro Sound and
analyzed at the Center for Marine Science Research (CMSR)in
Wilmington, NC using an osmometer. The dissolved oxygen membranes
are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24
hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are
recorded in the field observation log. Measurements of DO, pH,
salinity, specific conductance, and temperature are taken with
 a calibrated YSI 6000 or other field instruments to check the 
accuracy of the instrumentation before deployment (as of October 
1995). The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked steel
cage, then anchored to the bottom, and chained to a post at the 
monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 
measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity,
dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration,
depth, and pH. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is
either brought back to the laboratory or serviced in the field.
If the water quality instrument is serviced in the field the DO
sensor is either replaced with one that has a new membrane or the
old membrane is wiped with lens paper moistened with tap water to
remove biofouling. The weather and water quality measurements are
again noted in the field observation log. The calibration drift
and the effect of biofouling on the water quality instrument are
checked by comparing data readings in calibration standards or
against a recently calibrated YSI 6000 (as of October 1995). The
water quality instrument is then uploaded, cleaned and calibrated
as noted previously. The water quality instrument is then ready
to be redeployed.


5)Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine
Research Reserve (from north to south) are: Currituck Banks,
Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island. They are
located along the southeastern coast of the United States in the
Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro and Zeke's
Island components are transferred to the CDMO. The two sites are: 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of
Whiskey Creek, and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a
small navigable channel called Research Creek at 34 deg 09'21.7"
latitude and 77 deg 50'59.9" longitude (GPS position). The site
has a salinity range of 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages
1.2 meters.

2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island
The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal
Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33 deg 56'23.5"
latitude and 77 deg 56'28.1" longitude (GPS position). This site
receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear
River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies
of water. Thus, the ocean tidal input through New Inlet is a
major factor in maintaining the high salinity; however during
rainy periods major drops in salinity may occur. The site has a
salinity range of 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2
meters.


6)Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while
East Cribbing data collection commenced on 19 May 1994. All
monitoring is considered long term.

Site definitions:   RC=South Research Creek, Masonboro Island* 
                    EC=East Cribbing, Zeke's Island*

File definitions: site/month/year (ex.: ZI0895 = Zeke's Island
data from August of 1995). 

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zeke’s Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserve’s historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.


10) Data anomalies (suspect data):

File MS0195-  DO data removed due to heavy probe fouling.  See next section.
File ZI0195-  Instrument out of water at low tide, all data removed.  See next
              Section.
File MS0295-  DO probe malfunction, DO% and DO mg/l removed.  See next section.
              Instrument position shifted.  Exposed at low tide.  All data
		  Removed.  See next section.
File ZI0295-  High DO membrane fouling, data removed.  See next section.  
		  Instrument out of the water at low tide, all data removed.  See 
		  Next section.
File ZI0495-  DO probe malfunction, data removed.  See next section.
File ZI0595-  DO probe malfunction, data removed.  See next section.
File MS0795-  pH probe malfunction, data removed.  See next section.
File ZI0795-  Heavy DO probe membrane fouling, data removed.  See next section.
File MS0895-  pH probe malfunction, data removed.  See next section.
File ZI1095-  Instrument out of water at low tide.  All data removed.  See next
		  Section.  Specific conductance sensor out of range, specific    
		  conductivity and salinity data removed.  See next section
File MS1195-  Instrument out of water at low tide, all data removed.  See next 
		  Section.




File ZI1295-  The post calibration check for salinity was out of range by 10
  		  ppt for the sample period of 12/1/95-12/31/95 at East Cribbing.
  		  The deployed unit's readings were 10 ppt lower than the
  		  profiler's  measurements. This may have been caused by sensor
  		  drift during the long deployment or the two days of inactivity
  		  related to a delay in retrieval of the unit after its program had
  		  ended.


11) Missing data:

Approximately every 2-3 weeks, there is a period of between 1 to
24 hrs (occasionally longer) of missing data due to maintenance
and calibration. During the maintenance period all parameters
will be missing.

A record and explanation of missing data that are not related to
routine maintenance is kept in the field log for the particular
deployment. All parameters recorded when the water quality
instrument is exposed to air during a sample, either by an
extremely low tide or physical displacement from its original
location, are removed. Special note should be made regarding
missing dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (%), DO concentration
(mg/l), specific conductance, salinity, and temperature
measurements. If the DO saturation (%) data are removed, due to
sensor malfunction or other circumstances, the  DO concentration
(mg/l) will also be missing. The DO concentration (mg/l) is
calculated from DO saturation (%) and temperature data using
formulae that can be found in Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Waste Water (ed. 1989). This is also
true for specific conductance and salinity data. Salinity (ppt)
is determined by the YSI 6000 using specific conductance data,
temperature data, and algorithms found in Standard Methods for
the Examination of Water and Waste Water (ed. 1989). If the
temperature sensor malfunctions and the corresponding data are
removed, all parameters requiring these data (DO saturation, DO
concentration, specific conductance, salinity, and pH) for
calculation or temperature compensation will also be removed.
