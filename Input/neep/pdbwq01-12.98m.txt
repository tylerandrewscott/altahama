2.	Entry verification
	The data are downloaded from the YSI 6000s to an IBM compatible PC.  
Graphs of all data are printed using PC6000 software during the first part of 
the year and using Ecowatch software during the rest of the year and are 
examined for suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  Files are converted to 
Macintosh Excel files and edited for transfer to the NERRS CDMO.  Files are 
merged to contain one full month of data.  Missing data (from maintenance and 
downloading down time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by a 
period (.).  Suspect data are deleted and replaced by periods (.).  After 
formatting the data, some files are more closely checked for anomalies in 
DeltaGraph Pro(r).  No CDMO Excel 5.0 macros were used.  Edited and raw files are 
archived on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR.  This process of entry 
verification was completed by Robin Cottrell, Heather Defenderfer, Daniel Hahn, 
and Douglas Bulthuis for the 1998 data.  Final verification and this metadata 
documentation were completed by Douglas Bulthuis.


3.	Research Objectives
	The Bay View Channel YSI 6000 has been set out to detect and monitor 
short-term variability and long-term changes in Padilla Bay.  The Joe Leary 
Slough YSI 6000 has been set at the mouth of the slough to measure the effects 
of tidal "closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough and to detect long-
term changes in water quality in the slough associated with implementation of a 
non point source pollution watershed action plan.  The No Name Slough YSI 6000 
has been set at the mouth of No Name Slough to detect seasonal and long-term 
changes in water quality of the slough associated with residential development 
in the watershed and changes associated with experimental farming methods 
designed to reduce non-point source pollution to No Name Slough.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes at all three sites unless otherwise noted in data 
anomalies.


4.	Research methods
	A YSI 6000 was deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical position, 0.25 m 
above the bottom of the slough, in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe which has holes and 
slits drilled in it to allow water circulation around the probes.  The PVC pipe 
is attached to a steel pipe that was driven into the sediment.  Some dissolved 
oxygen data from Joe Leary Slough were anomalous and could be explained if there 
were poor exchange between the water inside the deployment tube and water 
outside the deployment tube.  Therefore during four days in October 1998 and 10 
days in December 1998, YSI datasondes were deployed inside and outside the 
deployment tube simultaneously at the same depth.  All data were very similar 
inside and outside the deployment tube (or fluctuated in parallel indicating 
differences in calibration) during October and December with the exception of 
the dissolved oxygen data during October.  During four tidal cycles in October, 
the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the deployment tube did not increase 
with increasing salinity as much as dissolved oxygen in the water outside the 
deployment tube.  (In Joe Leary Slough, salinities typically fluctuate from 0 to 
10, 20 or even 30 PSU with each tidal cycle, with higher oxygen concentrations 
usually observed in the high salinity water.)  The October dissolved oxygen data 
could indicate that organic material with a high oxygen demand might have 
accumulated inside the deployment tube and/or epiphytic and bacterial growth 
along the openings in the deployment tube may be exerting a high oxygen demand 
on the water in the tube.  If exchange between the water inside and outside the 
pipe were slow enough, the material and organisms inside the tube could exert a 
measurable decrease in dissolved oxygen.  When the same experiment was repeated 
in December, there was no difference in dissolved oxygen inside and outside the 
deployment tube.  Therefore, dissolved oxygen data from Joe Leary Slough need to 
be interpreted with caution because there may be times when the data indicate 
dissolved oxygen concentrations inside the deployment tube that are different 
than concentrations in Joe Leary Slough outside the deployment tube.

	A YSI 6000 was deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview Channel.  
It was deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, except that 
the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes.   The depth of the YSI was -1.1 m 
(depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a 
small channel draining the surrounding intertidal flats. 

	A YSI 6000 was deployed in No Name Slough using the same design as that in 
Joe Leary Slough, except that the PVC pipe was attached to a piling supporting a 
pump house in front of the tide gates.  The YSI 6000 sensors are about 0.20 m 
above the bottom.

	In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth and pH are recorded 
every half-hour.  At the end of each sampling period, the YSI 6000 is brought 
back into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration.   

	All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 6000 
Operation and Service Manual.  During January 1998, the software that was used 
to download data from the sondes and for pre- and post- deployment calibration 
was upgraded to version 3.14.  For the conductivity calibration a conductivity 
standard of 50 mS/cm was used.  The pH calibration is a 2 point calibration 
using standard pH buffer solutions with a pH of 7 and 10.  The KCl solution and 
Teflon membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6000 
deployment and the new oxygen membrane is allowed to soak overnight in water 
before calibration.
	

5.	Site location and character
	General Padilla Bay (48° 30' N; 122° 30' W) is a shallow embayment in 
northern Puget Sound.  The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera 
marina, which covers approximately 3,000 ha.  Zostera japonica, a recent invader 
to the region, now covers about 350 ha of the bay.  Tides are mixed semi-diurnal 
with a mean range of 1.55 m.  Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU.

	Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer 
empties directly into it.  Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed 
is agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay.  The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located.  
Major freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary 
come from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River 
to the south.

	Joe Leary Slough Site  (48° 31' 05.3" N; 122° 28' 22.8" W) Joe Leary 
Slough drains land which is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture 
land with some low density housing.  The slough is characterized by high fecal 
and nutrient inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  
During the summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m.  
During winter flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m.   There is a dam at 
the mouth of the slough with twelve 4-ft diameter outfall pipes that have one-
way hinged tide gates.   Saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through the tide 
gates during high tide.  The bottom of the slough is composed of very soft 
sediment, which is periodically dredged.  A YSI 6000 is deployed on the 
freshwater side of the tide gates at a depth of about 0.25 m above the bottom.  
The latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and 
differentially corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated 
accuracy of ± 5m.

	Bayview Channel Site  (48° 29' 46.6" N; 122° 30' 01.8" W) Bayview Channel, 
a major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macrovegetation.  
The YSI 6000 is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel.  The 
tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) covered 
intertidal flats.  Bottom sediments beneath the YSI 6000 are fine silt and clay 
overlying sand.   The YSI 6000 is deployed in a black PVC pipe that is attached 
to two steel pipes set in the sediment.  When deployed, the datasonde is located 
about 0.75 m above the bottom.  Pollutants entering the bay include general non-
point source, agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from 
agriculture, failing septic tanks and wildlife.  The latitude/longitude were 
measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and differentially corrected with post 
processing providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 5m.

	No Name Slough Site  (48° 28' 10.3" N; 122° 28' 02.6" W) No Name Slough 
drains a 990 ha watershed composed of an "upland" portion of rural, pasture, 
woodlot, and low density housing land use on a glacial moraine; and a 
"floodplain" portion of intensive annual crop agriculture on drained marsh land.  
The slough water is characterized by periodic high turbidity, high salinity in 
the lower part of the slough most of the year, and algal blooms in the lower 
slough during the summer.  During summer, there is little or no freshwater flow 
in the slough and depth ranges from 0.25-0.50 m.  During winter flooding, water 
depth at the mouth can be as high as 2 m.  No Name Slough flows into Padilla Bay 
through 4 tide gates that have been placed in the sea dike.  Saline water seeps 
through the tide gates, under the dike, or through the dike so that water is 
usually partially saline at the mouth of the slough on the "freshwater" side of 
the dike where the YSI 6000 is located.  Two pumps are located at the mouth of 
No Name Slough.  These pump water over the dike into Padilla Bay during times of 
high rainfall and high tides when water depth in the slough reaches preset 
depths.  Bottom sediments in No Name Slough are very soft.    The YSI 6000 is 
deployed 0.20 m above the bottom on the freshwater side of the dike on one of 
the piles supporting the pump house.  The latitude/longitude were measured with 
a Trimble GeoExplorer II and differentially corrected with post processing 
providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 5m.


6.	Data collection period
	Data collection was continuous from January 1 to December 31 at both sites 
except for times of downloading, cleaning and recalibration as noted in the 
missing data section.

*During 1997 records were kept of the atmospheric pressure during calibration of 
depth and the apparent depth after each two to four week deployment.  The data 
indicated that depth readings could read as much as 0.28 m above or below true 
depth.  Therefore, although the sensor may accurately read ± 0.001 m, changes in 
atmospheric pressure when deployed indicate depth may be ± 0.3 m.

10. Data anomalies
Please note* - There is no data from No Name Slough (NN) during 1998 due to 
insufficient staff support.  

January 1998
JL:   Isolated erratic high turbidity values were recorded at 1800 1 Jan, 0130 
and 0230 2 Jan, and 1730 25 Jan; cause unknown; data deleted.  pH data from 1130 
on 28 Jan to 2330 on 31 Jan appears erratic but probe calibrated (2 
Point) in pre-deployment calibration and read 7.2 in pH 7.0 buffered standard in 
a post-deployment check on 20 Feb.
BY:   All data suspect and need to be interpreted with caution from 0400 on 3 
Jan to 1700 on 7 Jan because probes had been exposed to the air during spring 
lower low water.  Depth data is relative because datasonde was caught in the 
deployment tube at an unknown depth.  Negative depths were recorded from 0130 to 
0300 on 4 Jan.  Depth above bottom is not known but is estimated to have been 
about 1.75 m.  Turbidity data from 1500 on 8 Jan to 1000 on 22 Jan may be 
somewhat high and should be interpreted with caution because at the end of the 
deployment period a check of the turbidity probe indicated a reading of 120 NTU 
in 100 NTU standard.  Dissolved oxygen data from 1500 on 8 Jan through 1000 on 
22 Jan may be suspect and should be interpreted with caution because the probe 
was slightly tarnished on retrieval and the probe failed the next time it was 
deployed; however, a post deployment check on 22 Jan indicated a reading of 
104.3% in water saturated air.  An erratic high turbidity was recorded at 1830 
on 22 Jan; cause unknown; datum deleted.

February 1998
JL:    pH data from 0000 1 Feb to 1000 20 Feb appears erratic but probe 
calibrated (2 Point) in pre-deployment calibration and read 7.2 in pH 7.0 
buffered standard in a post-deployment check on 20 Feb.  Erratic low and high 
conductivity and salinity readings from 0230 to 0330 on 18 February were 
deleted; cause for erratic values not known.
BY:   

March 1998
JL:    Dissolved oxygen values dropped to near zero for 3 readings and then back 
up to 78%, the cause is unknown, data deleted from 0430 to 0530 on 3 March.  A 
single turbidity value over 1000 at 0930 on 3 March was deleted, cause is not 
known.  Erratic high and low values for turbidity were observed from 2300 on 13 
Mar through 1300 on 24 Mar; data were deleted; cause unknown but could have been 
build up of vegetative material in the guard around the sonde.  Erratic high 
values for turbidity were recorded from 2330 29 Mar to 0000 30 Mar, cause 
unknown, data deleted.  Negative depth readings were recorded at the following 
times and were probably related to changes in barometric pressure after 
calibration in the lab (see note above in 8. Variable sequence, range of 
measurements, units, resolution and accuracy): 1830 to 1900 on 21 Mar.
BY:   

April 1998
JL:   No data for all parameters from 1900 on 20 April to 1230 on 21 April 
because the datalogger failed to log any data, the cause for the failure is not 
known but could have been caused by poor battery contacts.  Turbidity data were 
high and erratic from 2100 on 5 April to 0900 on 1300 April; cause is unknown 
but were probably caused by large amount of vegetation debris found in the water 
and the deployment tube on retrieval; data deleted.  Turbidity data were high 
and erratic from 0900 on 27 April to 1130 on 29 April; cause unknown; data 
deleted.
BY:   Single erratic high turbidity values were recorded at 2000 on 8 April and 
1430 on 29 April; cause unknown; data deleted.  Dissolved oxygen data from 1030 
on 21 April to 2330 on 30 April may be suspect and should be interpreted with 
caution because a post deployment check on 21 May at the end of the deployment 
indicated a reading of 78.9% in water saturated air.

May 1998
JL:    Dissolved oxygen data from 0930 on 14 May through 2330 on 31 May may be 
suspect and should be interpreted with caution because a post deployment check 
on 8 June at the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 88.1% in water 
saturated air.  Negative depth readings were recorded at the following times and 
were probably related to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the 
lab (see note above in 8. Variable sequence, range of measurements, units, 
resolution and accuracy): 1700-1730 on 1 May, 1230-1330 on 11 May, 1130-1500 on 
12 May, and 1200-1530 on 13 May.
BY:    Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 on 1 May to 1200 on 21 May may be suspect 
and should be interpreted with caution because a post deployment check on 21 May 
at the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 78.9% in water saturated 
air.  Dissolved oxygen data from 1230 on 21 May to 2330 on 31 May may be suspect 
and should be interpreted with caution because a post deployment check on 19 
June at the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 90.8% in water 
saturated air.

June 1998
JL:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 1 June to 1300 on 8 June may be suspect 
and should be interpreted with caution because a post deployment check on 8 June 
at the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 88.1% in water saturated 
air.  Erratic and high values for turbidity were observed from 1600 on 19 June 
to 1100 on 29 June; data were deleted; cause unknown but could have been caused 
by vegetative material in the guard around the sonde; some of which was observed 
at the end of the deployment period.  Negative depth readings were recorded at 
the following times and were probably related to changes in barometric pressure 
after calibration in the lab (see note above in 8. Variable sequence, range of 
measurements, units, resolution and accuracy): 1330 to 1430 on 24 June.
BY:   Dissolved oxygen data from 1000 on 1 June to 1300 on 19 June may be 
suspect and should be interpreted with caution because a post deployment check 
on 19 June at the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 90.8% in water 
saturated air.  Occasional negative values for turbidity (-001) were observed 
from 0230 on 20 June to 0000 on 30 June.  The cause is not known but these 
slight negative turbidity values probably indicate drift of the zero line during 
deployment.

July 1998
JL:   A single high turbidity value was recorded at 1400 on 25 July, cause 
unknown.  Dissolved oxygen data from 29 to 31 July may be suspect and should be 
interpreted with caution because a post deployment check on 12 August at the end 
of the deployment indicated a reading of 78.3% in water saturated air.
BY:   A single erratic high turbidity value was recorded at 1300 on 23 July; 
cause unknown; datum deleted.  Occasional negative values for turbidity (-001) 
were observed from 0100 on 3 July to 0630 on 13 July.  The cause is not known 
but these slight negative turbidity values probably indicate drift of the zero 
line during deployment.

August 1998
JL:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 1 Aug to 1430 on 12 Aug may be suspect and 
should be interpreted with caution because a post deployment check on 12 August 
at the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 78.3% in water saturated 
air.  A single high turbidity was recorded at 1400 on 10 August, cause unknown.  
Dissolved oxygen data from 0300 on 26 August to 2330 on 31 August appears 
irregular and may not be reliable; however, a post-deployment check on 1 Sep at 
the end of the deployment indicated a reading of 94.5% in water saturated air; 
the decreasing dissolved oxygen may have been due to decreasing salinity (less 
highly oxygenated salt water seeping through the tide gates into Joe Leary 
Slough).  Negative depth readings were recorded at the following times and were 
probably related to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab 
(see note above in 8. Variable sequence, range of measurements, units, 
resolution and accuracy): 0900 on 16 Aug, 1000 on 17 Aug, 1100-1130 on 18 Aug, 
1130-1200 on 19 Aug, and 1300 on 20 Aug.
BY:   Single erratic high turbidity values were recorded at 1500 on 6 Aug and 
1130 on 20 Aug; cause unknown; data deleted.  

September 1998
JL:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 to 1230 on 1 Sep appears irregular and may 
not be reliable; however, a post-deployment check on 1 Sep at the end of the 
deployment indicated a reading of 94.5% in water saturated air; the decreasing 
dissolved oxygen may have been due to decreasing salinity (less highly 
oxygenated salt water seeping through the tide gates into Joe Leary Slough).  
Negative depth readings were recorded at the following times and were probably 
related to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab (see note 
above in 8. Variable sequence, range of measurements, units, resolution and 
accuracy): 0900-0930 1 Sep, 0930-1030 on 2 Sep, 0930-1130 on 3 Sep, 1130-1200 on 
4 Sep, 1230 on 5 Sep, and 1330 on 7 Sep.
BY:   On two occasions during September the salinity and conductivity dropped 
suddenly 1 to 4 units for three hours and three days and then returned to the 
previous values.  The cause for this drop and "recovery" is not known; however, 
after deployment the conductivity probe recorded 49.45 mS/cm in 50.0 standard;   
therefore, data were deleted during the periods of low readings: 1800 to 2000 on 
21 Sep and 0200 on 23 Sep to 0000 on 27 Sep.  Single erratic high turbidity 
values were recorded at 1200 and 1600 on 30 Sep; cause unknown; data were 
deleted.

October 1998
JL:    Dissolved oxygen data from 0430 15 Oct to 1130 on 21 Oct were very low.  
High turbidity during this time period indicated an increase in nonpoint source 
pollution.  A post-deployment check on 21 Oct at the end of the deployment 
indicated a reading of 95.9% in water saturated air; but the new datasonde that 
was deployed read 39.9% dissolved oxygen in water that had been reading 0.9% 
dissolved oxygen 30 minutes earlier.  The causes for these anomalous data are 
not known, but water inside the deployment tube may not be exchanging very well 
with the surrounding water.  During 22-26 October and 12 to 20 December 1998, 
YSI 6000 datasondes were simultaneously deployed inside and outside of the 
deployment tube.  See Section 4. (above) Research Methods, Joe Leary Slough 
site.  Negative depth readings were recorded at the following times and were 
probably related to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab 
(see note above in 8. Variable sequence, range of measurements, units, 
resolution and accuracy): 0630 to 1230 on 1 Oct, 0800 to 1230 on 2 Oct, 0900 to 
1300 on 3 Oct, 0030 to 0330 on 7 Oct, 0030 to 0530 on 8 Oct, 0200 to 0530 on 9 
Oct, 0230 to 0630 on 10 Oct 0300 to 0900 on 11 Oct, and 0300 to 0930 on 12 Oct.
BY:   Datasonde was "caught" in deployment tube from 1600 on 14 Oct through 0730 
on 17 Oct; the probes were exposed to the air during low tides; all data were 
deleted during this time period.  All data from 0800 on 17 Oct through 1030 on 
29 Oct should be interpreted with caution because the probes had been exposed to 
the air at the beginning of the deployment (1600 on 14 Oct through 0730 on 17 
Oct).  All probes appeared in good condition on retrieval and read within 10% of 
the correct value in post-deployment calibration checks.

November 1998
JL:   Dissolved oxygen data from 4 Nov to 1430 on 9 Nov were very low.  There 
may have been a lot of organic material in Joe Leary Slough associated with the 
early seasonal rains.  A post-deployment check on 9 Nov at the end of the 
deployment indicated a reading of 98.0% in water saturated air; but the new 
datasonde that was deployed read 53.6% dissolved oxygen in water that had been 
reading 1.7% dissolved oxygen 30 minutes earlier.  Similarly, high turbidities 
and low dissolved oxygen concentrations were recorded from 14 Nov to 1500 on 23 
Nov (post-deployment check indicated a reading of 90.3% dissolved oxygen in 
water saturated air).  The causes for these anomalous data are not known, but 
water inside the deployment tube may not be exchanging very well with the 
surrounding water.  During 22-26 October and 12 to 20 December 1998, YSI 6000 
datasondes were simultaneously deployed inside and outside of the deployment 
tube.  See Section 4. (above) Research Methods, Joe Leary Slough site.  High and 
erratic turbidity values were recorded at the following times and removed from 
the database, the causes for these high erratic values is not known but could be 
caused by vegetative debris caught in the guard around the probes: 2300 on 6 
Nov, 0030 on 8 Nov, 1430 on 9 Nov, from 0000 18 Nov to 2100 on 19 Nov, 0700 and 
2330 on 20 Nov, and from 0330 on 27 Nov to 1730 on 29 Nov.  Turbidity data from 
2130 on 19 Nov to 1500 on 23 Nov may be suspect because of high and erratic 
turbidities observed earlier in the deployment. 
BY:   

December 1998
JL:    High and erratic turbidity values at 0030 on 6 Dec and 0030 on 8 Dec were 
deleted, cause unknown.  Erratic fluctuations in turbidity values were observed 
from 1100 to 1800 on 3 Dec, the cause is not known.  High turbidity values were 
observed on the 29th and 30th of December, cause unknown.  Negative temperatures 
were recorded on the 20th, 22nd and 23rd of December.
BY:    Dissolved oxygen data sharply increased at 1630 on 18 Dec and looked 
suspicious during the remainder of the deployment.  The dissolved oxygen 
membrane was punctured on retrieval and it was presumed that the membrane was 
punctured between 1600 and 1630 on 18 Dec; all dissolved oxygen data from 1630 
on 18 Dec to 2330 on 31 Dec98 were deleted.  A single erratic high turbidity 
value was recorded at 0330 on 7 Dec; cause unknown; datum was deleted.


11.	Missing data
Please note* - There is No data from No Name Slough during 1998 due to 
insufficient staff support.  

January 1998
JL:   Isolated erratic high turbidity values were recorded at 1800 1 Jan, 0130 
and 0230 2 Jan, and 1730 25 Jan; cause unknown; data deleted.
BY:   No data for all parameters from 0000 on 1 Jan through 0330 on 3 Jan and 
from 1730 on 7 Jan to 1430 on 8 Jan because the depth and salinity data 
indicated that the datasonde was caught in the PVC deployment tube and the 
probes were out of the water for part of each day during these time periods.  No 
data for all parameters at 1030 on 22 Jan because of exchange of datasondes for 
cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.  An erratic high turbidity was recorded 
at 1830 on 22 Jan; cause unknown; datum deleted.

February 1998
JL:    Erratic low and high conductivity and salinity readings from 0230 to 0330 
on 18 February were deleted; cause for erratic values not known.
BY:   

March 1998
JL:   No data for all parameters at 1130 on 3 March because of exchange of 
datasondes for cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.    Dissolved oxygen 
values dropped to near zero for 3 readings and then back up to 78%, the cause is 
unknown, data deleted from 0430 to 0530 on 3 March.  A single turbidity value 
over 1000 at 0930 on 3 March was deleted, cause is not known.  Erratic high and 
low values for turbidity were observed from 2300 on 13 Mar through 1300 on 24 
Mar; data were deleted; cause unknown but could have been build up of vegetative 
material in the guard around the sonde.  Erratic high values for turbidity were 
recorded from 2330 29 Mar to 0000 30 Mar, cause unknown, data deleted.
BY:  

April 1998
JL:    No data for all parameters from 1900 on 20 April to 1230 on 21 April 
because the datalogger failed to log any data, the cause for the failure is not 
known but could have been caused by poor battery contacts.  Turbidity data were 
high and erratic from 2100 on 5 April to 0900 on 1300 April; cause is unknown 
but were probably caused by large amount of vegetation debris found in the water 
and the deployment tube on retrieval; data deleted.  Turbidity data were high 
and erratic from 0900 on 27 April to 1130 on 29 April; cause unknown; data 
deleted.
BY:   No data for all parameters at 0930 on 1 April because of exchange of 
datasondes for cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.  Single erratic high 
turbidity values were recorded at 2000 on 8 April and 1430 on 29 April; cause 
unknown; data deleted.

June 1998
JL:    Erratic and high values for turbidity were observed from 1600 on 19 June 
to 1100 on 29 June; data were deleted; cause unknown but could have been caused 
by vegetative material in the guard around the sonde; some of which was observed 
at the end of the deployment period.
BY:   No data for all parameters from 1330 to 1530 on 19 June because of 
exchange of datasondes for cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.

July 1998
JL:   
BY:   No data for all parameters at 0830 on 15 July because of exchange of 
datasondes for cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.  A single erratic high 
turbidity value was recorded at 1300 on 23 July; cause unknown; datum deleted.

August 1998
JL:   
BY:   No data for all parameters from 1000 on 28 Aug to 2330 on 31 Aug because 
the depth and salinity data indicated that the datasonde was caught in the PVC 
deployment tube and that the probes were out of the water for part of each day.  
Single erratic high turbidity values were recorded at 1500 on 6 Aug and 1130 on 
20 Aug; cause unknown; data deleted.  

September 1998
JL:   No data for all parameters at 1300 on 1 Sep because of exchange of 
datasondes for cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.
BY:   No data for all parameters from 0000 on 1 Sep to 1300 on 18 Sep because 
the depth and salinity data indicated that the datasonde was caught in the PVC 
deployment tube and that the probes were out of the water for part of each day.  
No data for all parameters at 1330 on 18 Sep because of exchange of datasondes 
for cleaning, maintenance, and calibration.  On two occasions during September 
the salinity and conductivity dropped suddenly 1 to 4 units for three hours and 
three days and then returned to the previous values.  The cause for this drop 
and "recovery" is not known; however, after deployment the conductivity probe 
recorded 49.45 mS/cm in 50.0 standard; therefore, data were deleted during the 
periods of low readings: 1800 to 2000 on 21 Sep and 0200 on 23 Sep to 0000 on 27 
Sep.  Single erratic high turbidity values were recorded at 1200 and 1600 on 30 
Sep; cause unknown; data were deleted.

October 1998
JL:   No data for all parameters from 0000 to 0400 on 20 Oct because the 
datasonde stopped logging.  It is not known why the datasonde stopped logging 
but it may be because of poor battery contacts.
BY:   No data for all parameters from 1600 on 14 Oct through 0730 on 17 Oct 
because the probes were exposed to the air during low tides because the 
datasonde was "caught" in deployment tube.

November 1998
JL:   No data for all parameters from 2200 on 3 Nov to 0330 on 4 Nov because the 
datasonde stopped logging.  It is not known why the datasonde stopped logging

December 1998
JL:    No data for all parameters from 1400 on 11 Dec to 2000 on 12 Dec and from 
2130 on 20 Dec to 1200 on 22 Dec because of exchange of datasondes for cleaning, 
maintenance, and calibration.  High and erratic turbidity values at 0030 on 6 
Dec and 0030 on 8 Dec were deleted, cause unknown.
BY:  No dissolved oxygen data from 1630 on 18 Dec to 2330 on 31 Dec98 because 
data sharply increased at 1630 on 18 Dec and looked suspicious during the 
remainder of the deployment.  The dissolved oxygen membrane was punctured on 
retrieval and it was presumed that the membrane was punctured between 1600 and 
1630 on 18 Dec; all dissolved oxygen data from 1630 on 18 Dec to 2330 on 31 
Dec98 were deleted. A single erratic high turbidity value was recorded at 0730 
on 7 Dec; cause unknown; datum was deleted.
