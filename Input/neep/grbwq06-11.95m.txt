2.  Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a Zenith computer from the YSI in a comma delimited 
format. Files are then transferred to a Macintosh computer and opened in Excel 
5.0 software and edited. Missing data from YSI maintenance and other reasons are 
inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods (.). Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month of data.  Files are verified by means of CDMO 
Excel 5.0 macros.

3.  Research Objectives
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over two-week periods at the Great Bay 
site.

4.  Research methods (YSI data loggers)
In Great Bay the data logger is anchored to the bottom at a distance of one 
meter from the bottom. Every half hour over a two-week period, measurements of 
specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, pH, 
temperature and water level are recorded.  At the end of the two-week period, 
the YSI data logger is brought back to the Jackson Lab for downloading, cleaning 
and recalibrating.  VWR conductivity and pH standards are used for calibration.  
The data logger is then redeployed for another two-week period.

5.  Site location and character
The Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the northeastern 
coast of the United States at the tidal estuary, Great Bay in the southeastern 
part of New Hampshire.  There is one sampling site.
1) Great Bay  (GB) 43? 04’ 20”N, 70? 52’ 10”W


6.  Data collection period
Great Bay data collection began July 31, 1995. The data logger was removed from 
the site during the winter months.
