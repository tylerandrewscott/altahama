2.  Entry verification:

The data were directly downloaded from the YSI PC6600 data loggers into the YSI 
Ecowatch for Windows program in the PC. The data were graphed and visually 
checked for any obvious outliers. Notes are made of any unusual data or faulty 
probes. The data is then exported as a .csv file into an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and spaces. The CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls macro was used to QA/QC the data. The macro automatically formatted 
the column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications. It QA/QC's the data file for missing data points and filled all 
cells without data with periods. It also compiled a list of all data that fell 
outside the stated range of the different data logger probes. In addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.   An explanation for the missing and the deleted data is included in this metadata sheet.  The files were then transferred along with the associated metadata by disk to the CDMO.  The files are archived at OWC. Dr. David Klarer is responsible for both data logger deployment and data management.


3.  Research Objectives:

Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two-week periods at 
four sites within the Old Woman Creek- three in the estuary proper- one in the 
upper reaches at State Route 2 (SU), one near the mouth just south of State 
Route 6 (WM), and the third site is upstream from the WM site (OL). The final 
site (BR) is just upstream of the first riffle zone above the estuary in Old 
Woman Creek proper. The purpose of this monitoring program is to document the 
role of this Great Lakes estuary in the Lake Erie ecosystem, particularly the 
estuary's role in mitigating storm flow that passes through it.  The role of the 
OL site is to document the degree of intrusion by lake water during northerly 
winds and subsequent seiche events.

4.  Research methods:

The YSI monitoring program began on 12 March 2002 at the Berlin Road (BR), State Route 2 (SU), and the State Route 6 (WM) sites.  Sampling at the OL site did not begin until 23 April, 2002.  The sampling at all 
sites ended for the year on 2 December, 2002, except site OL, which ended on 18 
November,2002.  Prior to deployment of the data loggers, a 4-inch diameter PVC 
pipe was bolted to a metal 8-foot long metal post that had been driven into the 
sediment.  Each pipe had 4 rows of holes or 4 vertical slits 3/4" wide drilled 
into it spanning the area of the probe guard on the data logger so that the 
probes would have direct contact with the surrounding waters.  Dissolved oxygen, 
pH, temperature, turbidity, and specific conductance readings are taken when the 
instrument is pulled at each site. The data loggers are replaced in the field 
after a one, two, or three-week deployment, depending on temperature and degree 
of fouling of the data loggers.  The data was retrieved from each data 
logger and each data logger was recalibrated (according to the directions in the 
YSI Operations Manual) before being returned to the field.  Conductivity, pH (2 
point calibration), and turbidity (2 point calibration) are calibrated using 
commercial standards. Formazin (Hach, 4000 NTU) was diluted to prepare the 
standards for turbidity.  These standards were prepared prior to each 
deployment. The data loggers at sites WM and SU have water level sensors while 
the loggers at sites BR and OL have non-vented depth sensors.
 
5.  Site Location and Character:
Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio (Latitude 41( 23'N; Longitude 82( 33'W). Land use in the Old Woman Creek (OWC) watershed is primarily row crop agriculture. Other than the non-point source pollutants coming into the estuary from these agricultural practices and from the town of Berlin Heights, there are no other major pollution sources in the estuary. Salinity in Old Woman Creek is normally 1 ppt. or less, although it will rise, on occasion, to nearly 2 ppt. The tidal range in Lake Erie (and therefore in the estuary) is on the order of 4 cm or less. Water levels in the estuary and in the creek are extremely variable, with changes occurring daily, seasonally and annually.
 	The data logger at the State Route 6 (WM) site (Latitude 41( 22' 57" N, Longitude 82( 30'54" W) is very close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In this portion of the Reserve, the creek is very shallow but extends over a large surface area.  This site frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie waters.  The bottom sediments at this site are silty clay.  At the beginning of the deployment for 2002, there was no rooted aquatic vegetation directly adjacent to the site, although there was both emergent and submerged vegetation within 10 meters of the site. By mid September, Phragmites australis had grown up around the data logger trap.  The data logger is about .24 meters above the bottom sediments. On August 26 at 09:15:00 the old guard on the sonde was changed to the new guard, so this effectively raised the logger 5 cm within the trap.
	The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) site (Latitude 41( 22' 2" N, Longitude 82( 30'26" W) is very near the southern boundary of the Reserve.  This site is in the upper reaches of the estuary.  The data logger is sited near a concrete piling of the eastbound Ohio State Route 2 bridge.  At this site, the creek is relatively deep and narrow.  Although water direction and flow is 
influenced at this site by changes in Lake Erie water levels, this site doesn't have direct contact with Lake Erie waters.  The bottom sediments at this site are silty clay.  There is no rooted aquatic vegetation near or upstream from this site.  The data logger is about .25 meters above the bottom at this site.  On June 24, sediment buildup (due to storm runoff activity) under the trap 
was removed.	
The data logger at site OL (Latitude 41( 22' 55" N, Longitude 82( 30'51" W ) is in the lower reaches of the estuary. This site is not in direct sight of the mouth, so northerly winds and resulting seiche activities should be less noticeable at this site.  The bottom sediments are silty clay. This site is located at the northern tip of a Nelumbo lutea bed, so plants are immediately 
adjacent to the data logger. The base of data logger is about 11 cm above the sediment. 
	The data logger at site BR (Latitude 41( 20'54" N, Longitude 82( 30'30"W) is located in the lower portion of the creek proper. Just upstream from the data logger, Berlin Road crosses Old Woman Creek.  The site is just upstream of the first riffle area above the estuary.  Unlike the other three sites, Lake Erie water levels have no impact on this site. The bottom of the creek at this site is a combination of rocks interspersed with some clay-silt that has been washed in from upstream.  There are no aquatic macrophytes at or near this site.  The sonde is 24 cm above the bottom.  On 24 June, 2002 at 14:10 the trap was lowered 8 cm due to low water levels. On July 15 at 11:05 the logger was lowered another 5 cm within the trap by using the old guard instead of the new guard.

retains the right to be fully credited for having collected and processed the 
data.  Following academic courtesy standard, the RC and the NERR site where the 
data were collected will be contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent 
publications in which any part of the data are used. The data set enclosed 
within this package/transmission is only as good as the quality assurance and 
quality control procedures outlined in the enclosed metadata reporting 
statement.  The user bears all responsibility for its subsequent use/misuse in 
any further analyses or comparisons. The Federal government and the State of 
Ohio do not assume liability to the Recipient or third persons, nor will the 
Federal government or the State of Ohio reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for 
its liability due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under general information 
link on CDMO homepage) an online at the CDMO homepage http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu.  
Data are available in text tab-delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet 
format and comma-delimited format from the CDMO.

8.  Associated projects: Replicate samples for chemical analysis of the water 
are collected at each site every time the data loggers are changed. Samples for 
phytoplankton determination are collected at the same time at sites near the 
data logger deployment sites.  Additionally, a 26 hour sampling regime (samples 
are collected at 2 hour intervals over the 26 hours) is conducted at the 
WM site once during each month.

11.  Data anomalies

March 2002

WM:
All data deleted 03/23/2002 (07:45:00 - 16:45:00) due to specific conductivity probe being partially or completely out of the water.
Sampling for this site began on March 12, 2002 at 09:15:00.
Depth values were at or slightly below zero (probably because depth sensor was 
at or slightly above water surface):
	03/23/2002: (04:00:00-04:45:00); (10:15:00-18:45:00) 
Specific conductivity and depth readings were 3X higher than normal from 3/23 615-730 possibly
due to ice formation. 

SU:
Sampling for this site began on March 12, 2002 at 10:00:00.
Turbidity values were above 1000 NTU probably due to storm activity
	03/30/2002 (03:30:00); (04:00:00)

BR: 
There was no data collected 3/15/2002 (14:30:00- 20:45:00) cause unknown.

Turbidity values from 7/02/2002 (18:00:00) through 7/03/2002 (09:00:00) questionable due to above negative values that were deleted.
Dissolved oxygen values from 7/10/2002 (01:30:00) through 7/15/2002 (11:00:00)questionable due to siltation of sensor.
The high turbidity value on 7/15/2002 (11:15:00) was probably an artifact of 
changing datalogger.
Depth- On 7/15/2002 (11:15:00) datalogger deployed had the longer sonde guard, 
so was 5 cm higher in  trap- this is recorded in changing depth at this time 
from earlier.

Specific conductivity dropped in middle of deployment at 08/24/2002 (07:15:00-08:30:00) and remained low for remainder of month- the cause for this is unknown because the post deployment calibration of the conductivity probe was good.

WM:
All data missing 10/14/2002 (09:45:00) due to changing dataloggers
Oxygen -both percent saturation and mg/l deleted due to a puncture of the oxygen             
membrane 10/16/2002 (12:00:00) through 10/28/2002 (10:30:00).  Since the exact     
time of the puncture is unknown, the data from 10/15/2002 (12:00:00) through           
10/16/2002 (11:45:00) must be considered questionable
DO data prior to membrane puncture should also be considered suspect.  
Turbidity values were over 1000 NTU due to biological activity on

12.  Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure when no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of equipment, 
elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to calibration (both 
pre- and post-) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see Anomalous Data 
Section (11).  To find out more details about missing data, contact the Research 
Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

13.  Post deployment information

End of Deployment Post-calibration Readings in Standard Solutions: Dissolved 
oxygen standard is 100%, unless noted. Depth is always 0.0 meters. The specific 
conductivity standard is 1 mS/cm. The pH standard is 7.00. Any reading in 
parentheses refers to a reading made after cleaning the sensor.

14.  Other Remarks

There was some kind of event that took place around the end of March (3/25-3/28) that caused 
higher than normal specific conductivity and depth readings at the WM, SU and BR sites.  


Chemical Monitoring Program:

Replicate  samples for chemical and chlorophyll analysis were collected at each of the data logger sites each time the data loggers were changed.  The samples were collected prior to changing the data loggers, to insure that the samples for chemical analysis were undisturbed. Sample bottles, (previously washed with 10% HCl,  rinsed six (6) times with distilled water and then allowed to air dry upside down prior to sampling), were rinsed with the sample water three times before the sample was collected for analysis. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH values were determined on the samples at time of collection using field meters that were previously calibrated according to the manufacturer. If samples were not to be filtered and analyzed within the next  hour, they were stored in the dark on ice. 
Upon returning to the laboratory, each bottle was shaken and a 100 ml sub-sample for total P and metals (stored in a plastic bottle and preserved with 1 ml 10% HCl) and a 25 ml sub-sample for alkalinity determination were removed.  Also prior to filtering, turbidity and conductivity were determined using laboratory meters.   Samples for chemical and chlorophyll analysis were filtered as quickly as possible using an aspirator/vacuum system. Samples for chlorophyll analysis: A sample of known volume (for chlorophyll analysis) was filtered through a Gelman 47 mm diameter A/E filter (1 micron). The filter was then removed, folded, cut into small pieces, and then placed into 10 ml. aqueous acetone  (90% acetone, 10% saturated magnesium carbonate solution) in a 100 ml glass-stoppered bottle and stored in the freezer in the dark until analysis was conducted one week later. The procedure for chlorophyll analysis is described in Standard Methods for the Analysis of Water and Wastewater, 19th Edn. (1995) (Standard Methods) under  "Spectrophotometric Determination of Chlorophyll", page 10-18.

Samples for chemical analysis: After filtration for chlorophyll analysis, the water used for  chemical analysis was then filtered through a 47 mm diameter membrane filter (.45 micron) that had been prepared by soaking in distilled water as outlined in Standard Methods.  The chemical procedures used were from Standard Methods: 
Ammonia: 4500-NH3  Phenate Method  page 4-80
Nitrite: 4500-NO2 Colorimetric Method  page 4-83
Nitrate: 4500-NO3  Cadmium Reduction Method page 4-87
Phosphorus: 4500-P  Ascorbic Acid Method  page 4-113
The compete protocol used in both the chlorophyll and chemical analysis of the water is described in the Old Woman Creek Standard Operating Procedures Manual (2001).
