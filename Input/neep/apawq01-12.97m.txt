2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6000 into the PC6000 software, plotted, and 
initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing data.  Hydrolab data are downloaded from 
the Hydrolab Datasonde 3 to PCPLUS software.  Both YSI and Hydrolab raw data files are 
then downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) and imported into Microsoft Excel as a 
comma-space delimited file (.csv).  These raw data files are then organized into standardized 
monthly data sets using the import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly 
spreadsheet, import the raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters for 
depth readings if necessary, and save the monthly files as either a .csv or .xls file.  Once in 
monthly format, these files are then run through the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which 
identify outliers, insure correct number of data points for each Date/Hour count, and format 
the columns in the correct order and size.  The monthly files are then carefully edited by 
staff for data anomalies which are identified in Section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this 
document.  Any data that are deleted by staff are replaced with periods and identified in 
Section 12 (Missing Data) of this document.   Monthly edited files are then sent as .xls files, 
along with an updated metadata form, to CDMO.  As of this update, files and metadata will be 
sent by FTP to the CDMO in text format as per the CDMO operations manual, ver. 3.0.

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the Tates Hell 
Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the late 1960's and early 1970's 
by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage period and allowed increased runoff with a 
concommittant increase in pH which had a drastic affect on the biological communities in 
East Bay.  Because of this some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work 
was done.  A large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant will allow them to begin 
restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning the 
dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay will allow the Reserve to monitor changes 
in water quality during this restoration effort. 




4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the NERRS 
national monitoring effort.  Prior to this, ANERR has been and continues to monitor three 
stations in the Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, using Hydrolab Datasonde 
3's.  East Bay (bottom) is one of these stations and will be used in this monitoring program in 
addition to the YSI datalogger placed near the surface at this site. Since a Hydrolab datalogger 
was initially installed at the bottom at the East Bay station, we continued to use the Hydrolab 
brand in order to keep the data consistent with the previous two years of data.

Prior to deployment, both the YSI 6000 and the Datasonde 3 are calibrated for conductivity, 
dissolved oxygen, depth, and pH following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating and 
Service Manual (with addendum 7/94) and the Hydrolab Operating Manual, respectively.  Lab 
grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) are initially used to calibrate the YSI's, which are 
then used to check working standards made up and used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab 
grade standards are also used periodically to check the accuracy of the working salinity 
standards.  The only variation from the manual is the use of only one pH standard for one-
point calibration of pH rather than three-point calibration.  The membranes for the dissolved 
oxygen probe are installed at least 12 hours prior to calibration.  Depth is set to 0.0 meters in 
the lab.  A turbidity probe was added to the YSI 6000 in December 1996 and is calibrated 
using a lab grade (Fisher Brand) 40 NTU standard and deionized water (0 NTU).

Both YSI and Hydrolab dataloggers were attached to the same piling by divers.  The YSI was 
oriented with the probes upward in order to measure as close to the suface as possible, 
however the probes were turned downward in November 1997 (11/05/97 17:30:00) due to 
particulates settling on the turbidity probe optics.  The dataloggers were first attached to a 
stainless steel (SS) bar using  2 SS hose clamps, which was then attached to the piling using 
two additional SS hose clamps.  A SS cable with cable clamp was then inserted through one of 
the eye-hooks on the datalogger and around the piling as a safety cable.  The top of the SS 
bar was bent at 90 degrees to provide protection for the datalogger from boats, propellors, 
fishing line, or oyster tongs. A five inch diameter stainless-steel tube with a locking cap was 
installed on the piling in October of 1997.  In order to maintain constant depth, the 
dataloggers are clamped to a pvc pipe and lowered into the tube, relinquishing the need for 
diving.  Large holes were cut in the tube where the probes are located to insure adequate 
circulation.  Every two weeks the dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and 
inspected.  Freshly calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data 
gaps in the 30 minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the northwestern part of 
Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, 
and encompasses most of the Apalachicola Bay system, including 20 miles of the lower 
Apalachicola River.  Passes, both natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the 
northeastern Gulf of Mexico.  East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges 
and a causeway and is located to the north of the bay proper.  The sampling site is located in 
the upper reaches of East Bay and is influenced by local runoff from Tates Hell, the East Bay 
marshes, and distributary flow, some of which comes from the Apalachicola River via the 
East River.  The piling location is latitude 29(47.15' N and longitude 84(52.52' W.  Normal 
tidal range is approximately 0.5 meters.  Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt but is generally in 
the low range due to the freshwater input from the Tate's Hell drainage.  The freshwater 
input is very tanic and usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are not 
quantified due to the diverse sources of the runoff.  Depth at mean high water is 2.2 meters.  
The bottom type is soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with no vegetation present.

6. Data collection period:
East Bay surface sampling with the YSI began on April 17, 1995.  East Bay bottom sampling 
began on May 1, 1995. Both continue through December 31 of this year.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's to monitor water quality at three stations 
in Apalachicola Bay since May of 1992.  One of these stations was moved from the mid-bay 
area near the Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site in January of 1993.  The 
other two are located on two of the largest commercially important oyster bars in the bay.  
These stations, like East Bay, are intended to be long-term.
