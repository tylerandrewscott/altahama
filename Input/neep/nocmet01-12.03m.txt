2.  Entry verification

The 15-minute data, one-hour average, maximum and minimum data, and 24-hour 
average, totals, maximum and minimum data were downloaded from each instrument 
on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO 
datalogger program was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data 
collection schedule.  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software 
supplied by Campbell Scientific.  This software was located on a computer at the 
NOC NERR lab, to which the data were uploaded every hour via telemetry.  The 
data were saved in two separate areas on the computer and the Real Time Data 
Display software (provided by Campbell), displayed the near real time data in 
graphs and charts.  

The data were saved as monthly raw data files (comma-delimited format) on 
another computer and backed up on zip discs.  Data files were opened in 
Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro that was 
developed by the CDMO to reformat the header columns, insert station codes, 
insert a date column (mm/dd/yyyy), correct the time column format and reformat 
the data to the appropriate number of decimal places.  The pre-processed file is 
then ready to be copied into the EQWin weather.eqi file where the data were 
QA/QC checked and archived in a database.  EQWin queries, reports and graphs are 
used to discover data set outliers (values that fall outside the range that the 
instrument is designed to measure) and large changes in the data.  EQWin is also 
used to generate statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and reports 
of the data, cross query the water, weather, and nutrient data and finally 
export the data to the CDMO.  Any anomalous data were investigated and noted 
below in the Anomalous/Suspect Data Section.  Any data corrections that were 
performed are noted in the Deleted Data Section below.  The most common reported 
errors/anomalies in 2003 were precipitation differences greater than 5mm in 15 
minutes.  All errors of these types were double checked with other data that 
could support such "anomalous" weather changes and were noted in the sections 
that follow.

Raw data files and EQWin databases were saved on multiple computers, archived on 
Zip discs and/or compact discs, and backed-up on the CDMO server.  Paula May was 
responsible for error checking and compiling 2003 weather data.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected 
with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 
2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) 
with the new data format found in version 4.0(3 array output).  The new format 
produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), every 
hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the 
daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  
With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to 
code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained 
in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were 
removed and left blank.  

3.  Research Objectives

The principal objectives are to establish long-term monitoring of the weather in 
the vicinity of Masonboro Island, to obtain better data on storms and to be able 
to correlate the weather, water quality, chlorophyll and nutrient data.  In 
addition, the weather data collected will be used in support of other ongoing 
projects within the Reserve and nearby area.

4.  Research methods 

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds continuously 
throughout the year.  These data are used by the CR10X to produce 15 minute 
averages, maximum and minimums (array 15), hourly averages, maximums and 
minimums (array 60) and daily averages, maximums and minimums (array 144) of air 
temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed, and 
wind direction.  Data are stored in a storage module connected to the CR10X and 
also downloaded hourly to a PC located in the NOCNERR lab via telemetry using 
the PC208W software package.  Data are periodically compared to values recorded 
by other local weather stations to verify accuracy.  Data are also quality 
checked using EQWin.  The reports, graphs and queries of meteorological data are 
printed and reviewed.  Anomalous data and errors are further investigated and 
data are corrected, deleted (if necessary) or left unchanged and noted in the 
metadata report. 
 	
  The weather station and sensors are inspected monthly for cleaning and/or 
repair.  Sensors are replaced and/or calibrated according to the manufacturer's 
guidelines (annually or biannually).  

5.  Site location and character 

The components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve (from 
north to south) are: the Northern Sites component, Rachel Carson, Masonboro 
Island, Zeke's Island, and the Southern Sites component.  They are located along 
the southeastern coast of the United States in the Atlantic Ocean. Currently, 
only data from Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island components are transferred to 
the CDMO.  The four water quality sites and meteorological station are: 

a) Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The first Masonboro Island site (formerly called Masonboro Island (MS)) is 0.72 
km north east from the mouth of Whiskey Creek, and east of the Intracoastal 
Waterway (ICW), in a small navigable channel called Research Creek at 
34°09'21.7" latitude and 77° 50'59.9" longitude. The site has a salinity range 
from 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 meters.  The creek bottom is 
characterized by sand and detritus based sediment with areas of soft mud with a 
depth ranging from 0.34 to 2.45 m.  The sole source of freshwater is rain.  
Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, which is relatively unimpacted 
by manmade perturbations and it is not accessible to road traffic.  The site 
does experience minimal boat traffic.  

b) Loosin Creek, Masonboro Island
The second Masonboro Island site (added in 2002) is 1.2 km east of the ICW, and 
2.5 km south west of Masonboro Inlet, in a small navigable channel called Loosin 
Creek at 34° 10'20.0" latitude and 77° 49'58.1" longitude. The site has a 
salinity range from 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 meters.  The 
creek bottom is characterized by sand and detritus based sediment with areas of 
soft mud with a depth ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m.  The sole source of freshwater 
is rain.  Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, which is relatively 
unimpacted by manmade perturbations and it is not accessible to road traffic.  
The site does experience minimal boat traffic.    

c) East Cribbings, Zeke's Island
The first Zeke's Island site (formerly called Zeke's Island (ZI)) is located 1.8 
km south of Federal Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33° 56'23.5" 
latitude and 77° 56'28.1" longitude. This site receives minimal freshwater input 
from leakage of the Cape Fear River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separates 
the two bodies of water.  The site has a salinity range from 15-35 ppt and a 
tidal range that averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found 
to range from 0.11 to 2.30 meters.  Bottom type substratum consists of large 
rocks (the cribbings) with sand and detritus based sediment.  There are no 
pollutants from land.  Marsh and dunes surround the site; not accessible to road 
traffic and minimal boat traffic.

d) Zeke's Basin, Zeke's Island
The second Zeke's Island site (added in 2002) is located 0.8 km south east of 
the Federal Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33° 57'17.0" latitude 
and 77° 56'6.0" longitude. This site receives minimal freshwater input from 
leakage of the Cape Fear River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separates the 
two bodies of water.  The site has a salinity range from 11-35 ppt and a tidal 
range that averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found to 
range from 0.1 to 2 meters. Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus 
based sediment with a layer of soft sulfuric mud.  There are no pollutants from 
land.  Marsh and dunes surround the site; not accessible to road traffic and 
minimal boat traffic.

e) Research Creek Meteorological Station
The meteorological site is located on Masonboro Island, 2.09 km from the NOC 
NERR lab, and approximately 76.2 m from the Masonboro Island water quality 
deployment site.  The weather station is located on an inactive dredge spoil 
island next to Research Creek east of the Intracoastal Waterway.  It is directly 
across the Intracoastal Waterway from Whiskey Creek, at 34° 9.328'N, 77° 
51.054'W.  The station sits at an elevation of approximately 4.88 m above sea 
level, slightly offset from the highest point of the spoil, which has a maximum 
elevation of approximately 5.8 m.  The site has scrub surrounding the periphery, 
and grassy cover in the central areas. The weather station consists of a 3-meter 
aluminum tower that holds the wind sensor (wind speed and direction) at a height 
of 3.68 m and the Li-COR sensor at a height of 3.66 m.  The temperature and 
relative humidity sensor is mounted on the tower at 2.39 m and the barometric 
pressure, which is inside of the CR10X housing, is mounted at a height of 1.75 
m.  The rain gauge is located on a separate platform 7.62 m east south east of 
the tower and is mounted at a height of 1.79 m.  The sensors were wired to the 
CR10X (Campbell datalogger) according to the protocol in the Meteorological 
Monitoring SOP. 

6.  Data collection period

Collection of meteorological data began on 15 March 1997 and continues through
the present.  Instruments were deployed prior to this date; however, data were 
for initial testing and verification of functions, and have since been discarded.

7.  Distribution

According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) Data Dissemination 
Policy for the NERRS System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), 

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Estuarine Reserves 
Division (ERD) retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of 
the NERRS SWMP data.  The PI retains the right to be fully credited for having 
collected and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standards, the PI 
and NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and fully 
acknowledged in any subsequent publication in which any part of the data are 
used.  Manuscripts resulting from the NOAA/OCRM supported research that are 
produced for publication in open literature, including refereed scientific 
journals, will acknowledge that the research was conducted under an award from 
the ERD, OCRM, National Ocean Service (NOS), NOAA.  The data enclosed within the 
package/transmission are only as good as the quality assurance/quality control 
procedures outlined by the enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user 
bears all responsibility for its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses 
or comparisons.  The Federal government does not assume liability to the 
Recipient of third persons, nor will the Federal government reimburse or 
indemnify the Recipient for its liability due to any losses resulting in any way 
from the use of this data.

NERR weather data and metadata can be obtained from the Research Coordinator at 
the individual NERR site (see section I. 1. Principal investigators and contact 
persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized Data Management Office (see 
personnel directory under the general information link on the CDMO home page) 
and online at the CDMO home page http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/.  Data are available 
in text format and Access data tables.

8.  Associated researchers and projects

Meteorological data will be used to augment other research components of the 
System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) that currently include water quality, 
chlorophyll and nutrient monitoring.  The principal objective of the water 
quality monitoring is to record long-term water quality data in order to observe 
and document any physical and chemical changes or trends in water quality over 
time.  The objective of the chlorophyll and nutrient monitoring study is to 
ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient and chlorophyll a levels 
surrounding the four water quality sites.    

Additional projects are ongoing and continually changing.  Check with the 
Research Coordinator or other contact person for an updated list of research 
(see section I.1.).

Beginning on 24 September, the value of -99999 was recorded by the CR10X for 
wind speed periodically throughout the data set for unknown reasons.  The values 
were not removed, but should be noted as erroneous.

After the Licor sensor was replaced on 3 November, slightly negative values for 
PAR data were recorded for numerous periods of time when no light was present.  
These data were corrected by changing the values to zero.


12.  Deleted data:

Inaccurate precipitation data were collected due to testing and/or cleaning of 
the rain gauge.  Precipitation data for the following dates and times were 
removed:
Array		Date		Time

When the CR10X is powered down for maintenance or other causes or the program 
reloaded, all temporary 5 second data for that calendar date are lost at the 
moment of power down.  When the CR10X is powered again the 5 second data from 
that point on for that date are again stored in the daily temporary file for 
that calendar date.  Consequently, the daily averages, maximums and minimums for 
all parameters, which are calculated for the calendar date using the 5 second 
data file, will be incorrect for the calendar date because only a portion of the 
day's data will be used for calculation.  The same applies to the hourly and 15 
minute averages, maximums and minimums for the time period immediately following 
a power down event.  Current protocol is to delete the daily data for these 
dates as well as any hourly and 15 minute averages so affected.

All data for the following dates and times were deleted due to power downs 
and/or program reloads:
Array		Date		Time 
144		06/13/03	00:00
60		11/03/03	17:00

Wind speed and wind direction data were deleted for the following dates and 
times due to erroneous values recorded for unknown reasons:
Array		Date		Time 
15		07/22/03	09:15
15		07/22/03	16:15
15		10/29/03	05:15

An erroneous value for wind speed was deleted for array 60 at 06:00 on 10/29/03. 

All wind data were deleted from 16:45 on 11/03/03 through 16:00 on 11/13/03 due 
to errors in the CR10X program causing erroneous values to be recorded. 

An erroneous value of 447 was recorded periodically throughout the data set from 
April through December for wind speeds, wind speed maximums, and wind speed 
minimums for unknown reasons.  These values were deleted from the data set.

13.  Missing data

Data are missing due to equipment or associated specific probes not being 
deployed, equipment failure, time of maintenance or calibration of equipment, or 
repair/replacement of a sampling station platform.  For more details on deleted 
data, see the Deleted Data Section (12).  If additional information on missing 
data is needed, contact the Research Coordinator at the reserve submitting the 
data.

All data for the following dates and times are missing due to power downs and/or 
program reloads:

Hurricane Isabel passed over the area on 18 September 2003.

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
