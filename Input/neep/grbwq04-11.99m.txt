2. Entry verification
The data are transmitted every thirty minutes from YSI 6000 or 6600 
datasondes via VHF packet radio using Ecowatch software to a base 
station PC. Files are first examined and graphed using Ecowatch 
software.  Missing and/or anomalous data are noted. Files are then 
transferred to a Macintosh computer and opened in Excel 5.0 software 
and edited. Missing data due to routine YSI maintenance and probe 
failure or communication errors are inserted into the spreadsheet and 
denoted by periods (.).
Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Files are 
verified by means of CDMO Excel 5.0 macros. 

3. Research Objectives
In 1999, YSI 6000 or 6600 datasondes were deployed in Great Bay and in 
the Squamscott and Lamprey Rivers part of the National Estuarine 
Research Reserves' (NERRS) Systemwide Monitoring Program (SWMP). The 
goal is to develop and maintain temporally intensive long-term datasets 
of physio-chemical parameters of water quality at locations that are 
representative of the Great Bay Estuarine System. The Great Bay site is 
relatively unimpacted, while the two tidal river sites (Lamprey and
Squamscott) have large drainage basins and are impacted by both point 
(wastewater treatment plants) and nonpoint sources of pollution.  In 
addition to establishing a baseline of water quality, and understanding 
the spatial and temporal variability of important indicators of 
estuarine water quality, the data is used by a number  of researchers 
in the analysis of physical and biological processes.

4. Research Methods
Datasondes are programmed to obtain measurements of specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, pH, 
temperature, water level and turbidity every half hour. The purchase of 
two YSI 6600 instruments and fluorescence probes in late 1999 also 
provided an opportunity to evaluate the accuracy of fluorescence 
measurements.  The instruments are deployed continuously during ice-
free seasons, except for brief periods when they are removed for 
cleaning, maintenance and recalibration. Pre and post-deployment 
calibrations are performed using the diagnostics menu of the YSI 
Ecowatch program and QA/QC procedures developed by NERR Research 
Coordinators and YSI engineers. VWR conductivity and pH standards are 
used for calibration. Hach formazin is used to calibrate turbidity 
probes.
The sonde in Great Bay is deployed in a YSI EM 550 buoy, while the 
Lamprey and Squamscott river stations are piling mounted 
deployments(see below). The sonde in Great Bay is deployed in a YSI EM 
550 buoy, while the Lamprey and Squamscott river stations are piling 
mounted deployments (see below). Because the sonde at the central Great 
Bay site (GB) is deployed in an EM 550 surface buoy, it does not 
measure depth data.  In 1998, depth data for the GB site was obtained 
using an additional anchored sonde supplemented by time adjusted water 
level data from the Squamscott River site (SQ).
Comparison of the 1998 water level data from anchored GB sonde and the 
fixed-depth Squamscott sonde indicated that the Squamscott sonde could 
accurately provide depth data for the GB site with a 30-minute phase 
delay. This allowed us to eliminate the redundant deployment at the GB 
site in 1999, and to use time-adjusted water level data from the 
Squamscott River site.  For the GB 1999 data set, all times and dates 
for which only water level data was missing occurred when there was no 
corresponding (date & time) water level data from the Squamscott sonde.  
Missing data at the Squamscott site was due to removal of the 
instrument for cleaning and recalibration or failure of the sonde to 
transmit data.

6.  Data collection period
Great Bay data collection began April 22, 1999 and ended December 22, 
1999.  Squamscott River data collection began April 19, 1999 and ended

12. Other Remarks/notes
Salinity at the Lamprey River (LR) site remained very high from June through 
September 1999 due to very little rain at that time in 1999.
When fresh water is not coming into the river, the large fluctuations in 
salinity that occurs with the tides is absent when there is not sufficient 
rainfall to allow freshwater into the system.  At the beginning of September, we 
had two very heavy rains, 4 inches on 9/10 and 3 more inches on 9/16.
At this point you can see the salinity range returning to the large tidal 
influenced fluctuations.
