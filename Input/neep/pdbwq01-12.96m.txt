2.	Entry verification
	The data are downloaded from the YSI 6000s to an IBM compatible PC.  
Graphs of all data are printed using PC6000 software and are examined for 
suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  Files are converted to Macintosh Excel 
files and edited for transfer to the NERRS CDMO.  Files are merged to contain 
one full month of data.  Missing data (from maintenance and downloading down 
time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by a period (.).  
Suspect data are deleted and replaced by periods (.).  After formatting the 
data, some files are more closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro¨.  
Edited and raw files are archived on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR.

3. Research Objectives
	The Bay View Channel YSI 6000 has been set out to detect and monitor 
short-term variability and long-term changes in Padilla Bay.  The Joe Leary 
Slough YSI 6000 has been set at the mouth of the slough to measure the effects 
of tidal "closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough and to detect long-
term changes in water quality in the slough associated with implementation of a 
watershed action plan.  The No Name Slough YSI 6000 has been set at the mouth of 
No Name Slough to detect seasonal and long-term changes in water quality of the 
slough associated with residential development in the watershed and changes 
associated with experimental farming methods designed to reduce non-point source 
pollution to No Name Slough.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes at both 
sites unless otherwise noted in data anomalies.

4.	Research methods
	A YSI 6000 was deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical position, 0.25 m 
above the bottom of the slough, in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe which has holes and 
slits drilled in it to allow water circulation around the probes.  The PVC pipe 
is attached to a steel pipe which was driven into the sediment.

	A YSI 6000 was deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview Channel.  
It was deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, except that 
the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes.  The depth of the YSI 6000 probes 
during the first half of 1996 is not known because of a "catch" in the chain 
that was discovered during the summer of 1996 and corrected July 12, 1996.  
Approximate depth was about 0.5 to 1.0 m above chart datum (0.0 m, MLLW) and 
about 2 m above the bottom from January 1 to July 12, 1996.  The depth of the 
YSI 6000 from July 12 to December 31, 1996 was -1.1 m (depth below MLLW) and 
about 0.75 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a small channel draining 
the surrounding intertidal flats. 

	A YSI 6000 was deployed in No Name Slough using the same design as that in 
Joe Leary Slough, except that the PVC pipe was attached to a piling supporting a 
pumphouse in front of the tide gates.  The YSI 6000 sensors are about 0.20 m 
above the bottom.

	In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth and pH are recorded every 
half-hour.  At the end of each sampling period, the YSI 6000 is brought back 
into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration.   

	All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 6000 
Operation and Service Manual.  For the conductivity calibration a conductivity 
standard of 50 mS/cm was used from Jan96 through Nov96 and 10 mS/cm was used 
during Dec96.  The pH calibration is a 2 point calibration using standard pH 
buffer solutions with a pH of 7 and 10.  The KCl solution and teflon membrane on 
the dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6000 deployment and the 
new oxygen membrane is allowed to soak overnight in water before calibration.
	
5.	Site location and character
	General Padilla Bay (48 30' N; 122 30' W) is a shallow embayment in 
northern Puget Sound.  The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera 
marina, which covers approximately 3,000 ha.  Zostera japonica, a recent invader 
to the region, now covers about 350 ha of the bay.  Tides are mixed semi-diurnal 
with a mean range of 1.55m.  Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 o/oo.  

	Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer 
empties directly into it.  Most of the land in the Padilla Bay watershed is 
agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs, which empty into the bay.  Padilla 
Bay also receives fresh water from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north 
and from the Skagit River to the south.  These rivers flow into Puget Sound and 
the Strait of Georgia in which Padilla Bay is located.

	Joe Leary Slough Site  (48 31' 05" N; 122 28' 25" W) Joe Leary Slough 
drains land which is predominantly agricultural with some pasture land.  The 
slough is characterized by high fecal and nutrient inputs, high turbidity, and 
low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  During the summer, there is low flow and 
the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m.  During winter flooding, the slough can reach a 
depth of 4 m.   There is a dam at the mouth of the slough with twelve 4 ft 
diameter outfall pipes that have one-way hinged tide gates.   Saline water from 
Padilla Bay seeps through the tide gates during high tide. The bottom of the 
slough is composed of very soft sediment, which is periodically dredged.  A YSI 
6000 is deployed on the freshwater side of the tide gates at a depth of about 
0.25 m above the bottom.  

	Bayview Channel Site  (48 29' 47" N; 122 30' 07" W) Bayview Channel, a 
major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macrovegetation.  
The YSI 6000 is located in a major tributary channel to Bayview Channel.  The 
tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) covered 
intertidal flats.  Bottom sediments beneath the YSI 6000 are fine silt and clay 
overlying sand.  Pollutants entering the bay include general non-point source, 
agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliforms from agriculture, failing 
septics and wildlife.

	No Name Slough Site  (48 28' 09" N; 122 28' 03" W).  No Name Slough drains 
a 990 ha watershed composed of an "upland" portion of rural, pasture, woodlot, 
and low density housing land use on a glacial moraine; and a "floodplain" 
portion of intensive annual crop agriculture on drained marsh land.  The slough 
water is characterized by periodic high turbidity, high salinity in the lower 
part of the slough most of the year, and algal blooms in the lower slough during 
the summer.  During summer, there is little or no freshwater flow in the slough 
and depth ranges from 0.25-0.50 m.  During winter flooding, water depth at the 
mouth can be as high as 2 m.  No Name Slough flows into Padilla Bay through 4 
tide gates that have been placed in the sea dike.  Saline water seeps through 
the tide gates, under the dike, or through the dike so that water is usually 
partially saline at the mouth of the slough on the "freshwater" side of the dike 
where the YSI 6000 is located.  Two pumps are located at the mouth of No Name 
Slough.  These pump water over the dike into Padilla Bay during times of high 
rainfall and high tides when water depth in the slough reaches preset depths.  
The bottom is very soft sediment which is periodically dredged.  The YSI 6000 is 
deployed 0.20 m above the bottom on the freshwater side of the dike on one of 
the piles supporting the pumphouse.

6.	Data collection period
	Data collection was continuous from January 1 to December 31 at the Joe 
Leary (JL) site except for times of downloading, cleaning and recalibration as 
noted in the missing data section.  Data collection was continuous from January 
1 to December 31 at the Bayview Channel site (BY) except 1) for times of 
downloading, cleaning and recalibration as noted in the missing data section; 
and 2) for times when the probes were exposed to the air because of a 'catch' in 
the chain holding the YSI 6000 during January to July, which times are also 
noted in the missing data section.  Data collection was continuous from August 
17 to December 31 at the No Name site (NN) except for times of downloading, 
cleaning and recalibration as noted in the missing data section.

10.	Data anomalies
January 1996
JL:  The depth data are relative probably because depth was incorrectly 
calibrated.  Low dissolved oxygen was not confirmed independently; therefore DO 
values considered suspect and deleted from 1/1/96 00:00 through 1/11/96 14:00.  
BY:  

February 1996
JL:  An electrical malfunction changed the time of the sampling interval from 
every 30 minutes to every 30 minutes and 1 second starting at 11:30 on 
23Feb and ending at 16:01:51 on 26Feb.  Sampling interval then 
reverted back to every 30 minutes.  The depth data are relative probably 
because depth was incorrectly calibrated.
BY: 

March 1996
JL:  An electrical malfunction in the sonde skipped the sampling from 00:00 
on 1Mar96 through 17:30 on 2Mar96, and changed the time of 
sampling by 1 minute and 51 seconds so that samples from 18:00 on 
2Mar96 through 13:00 on 15Mar96 were taken 1 minute and 51 
seconds after the hour or half hour (e.g. at 18:01:51 and 18:31:51).  The 
cause for the high turbidity values on 25Mar96 from 11:30 through 
18:00 are not known and may indicate interference with the probe 
rather than high turbidity in the water column.
BY:  Anamolous low dissolved oxygen data were observed from 0430 on 
29Mar96 through 2330 on 31Mar96; the cause for these occasional low 
values is not known and dissolved oxygen data throughout this time 
period is suspect.

April 1996
JL:
BY:  The YSI 6000 sonde at the Bayview Channel site was deployed at an 
unknown depth (because of a 'catch' in the chain holding the sonde) 
and the sonde and sensors were out of the water and exposed to the air 
during lower low water.  Salinity values dropped to zero during periods 
of exposure and all data during periods of low salinity were removed 
from the data file.  The effect on the calibration and reliability of the 
sensors is not known and all data from this site during this month 
should be interpreted with caution.  Anamolous low dissolved oxygen 
data were observed from 0000 on 1Apr96 through 0830 on 9Apr96; the 
cause for these occasional low values is not known and dissolved 
oxygen data throughout this time period is suspect.  The dissolved 
oxygen data from1400 on 20Apr96 2330 on 30Apr96 are suspect 
because the probe and membrane were exposed to the air periodically.

May 1996
JL:
BY:  The YSI 6000 sonde at the Bayview Channel site was deployed at an 
unknown depth (because of a 'catch' in the chain holding the sonde) 
and the sonde and sensors may have been out of the water and 
exposed to the air during lower low water.  Salinity values dropped to 
zero during periods of exposure and all data during periods of low 
salinity were removed from the data file.  The effect on the calibration 
and reliability of the sensors is not known and all data from this site 
during this month should be interpreted with caution.  The reported 
depth increase of 0.29 m at 1700 on 30May96 occurred when one sonde 
was being replaced by another and was probably caused by differences 
in the method of calibration.    Salinity and conductivity data dropped 
about 20% at 1700 on 30May96 at the time that the sondes were 
rotated.  The lower values from 1700 on 30May96 to 2330 on 31May96 
are suspect and probably caused by incorrect calibration of the conductivity
sensor.  All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, 
specific conductivity and DO mg/L) from 1700 30May96 to 2330 31May96.  

June 1996
JL:
BY:  The YSI 6000 sonde at the Bayview Channel site was deployed at an 
unknown depth (because of a 'catch' in the chain holding the sonde) 
and the sonde and sensors may have been out of the water and 
exposed to the air during lower low water.  Salinity values dropped to 
zero during periods of exposure and all data during periods of low 
salinity were removed from the data file.  The effect on the calibration 
and reliability of the sensors is not known and all data from this site 
during this month should be interpreted with caution.  Salinity and 
conductivity data are about 20% lower than expected and their 
accuracy doubtful;  the lower values may have been caused by incorrect 
calibration or out of date calibration solutions.  All variables 
dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, specific conductivity 
and DO mg/L) from entire month.
Negative depths were recorded at 0700 and 0830 on 27Jun96 and and 
are probably a result of changes in atmospheric barometric pressure 
since the time of calibration. 

July 1996
JL:  A single reading of 625 NTU (turbidity) at 14:30 on 29Jul96 is 
anamolous; the cause is unknown but the reading may not represent 
water column turbidity.  
BY:  The YSI 6000 sonde at the Bayview Channel site was deployed at an 
unknown depth (because of a 'catch' in the chain holding the sonde) 
and the sonde and sensors may have been out of the water and 
exposed to the air during lower low water from July 1 through 1030 on 
July12.  Salinity values dropped to zero during periods of exposure and 
all data during periods of low salinity were removed from the data file.  
The effect on the calibration and reliability of the sensors is not known 
and all data from this site during the period July 1 to 10:30 on July 12 
should be interpreted with caution.  The 'catch' in the chain was 
corrected on 12Jul at 1200 and the large increase in depth recorded at 
that time was due to deployment at the planned experimental depth     
(-1.1 m below MLLW and 0.75 m above the bottom.)  Salinity and 
conductivity data are about 20% lower than expected throughout the 
month and their accuracy doubtful;  the lower values may have been 
caused by incorrect calibration or out of date calibration solutions.  
All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, specific conductivity 
and DO mg/L) from entire month. 
High and unexplained turbidities that probably do not reflect water 
quality conditions were recorded at 1330 on 21Jul, 1100 on 27Jul, 
and 1730 on 28Jul96.


August 1996
JL:  The high turbidity reading at 10:30 on 10Aug96 is anamolous, the cause 
is not known.  Depth data were negative at the following times and 
dates:  11:30 on 10Aug96; from 09:30 to 11:30 on 25Aug96; from 10:00 
to 13:30 on 26Aug96; and from 11:30 to 13:00 on 27Aug96.
BY:   Salinity and conductivity data are about 20% lower than expected and 
their accuracy doubtful;  the lower values may have been caused by 
incorrect calibration or out of date calibration solutions.  
All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, specific conductivity 
and DO mg/L) from entire month.  The dissolved 
oxygen data indicate a drift downward and readings from 1Aug to 21 
Aug 0930 should be interpreted with caution.  After retrieval of the 
sonde on 21 Aug, the DO membrane was intact and read 81.4% 
saturation when placed in water saturated air.  During a second 
deployment in August (from 21 Aug to 30 Sep)  oxygen data drifted 
slightly downward from 27 Aug to 31 Aug and readings should be 
interpreted with caution.  After retreival of the sonde on Sep 30, the 
D.O. membrane was intact and read 92.8% saturation when placed in 
water saturated air.
NN:  Negative depths reported on 25 to 27 Aug are probably due to changes in 
atmospheric barometric pressure.  High dissolved oxygen data from 16-
31Aug may be due to extensive algal mats in the slough.  After retrieval 
of the sonde on 5 Sep, the DO membrane was intact but had light 
fouling on the membrane and read 90% saturation when placed in 
water saturated air. 

September 1996
JL:  High and anamolous turbidity data were recorded at the following times 
and probably were caused by debris in the sonde guard:  1500 on 8Sep, 
0000, 0700, & 1730 on 9Sep, 1830 & 1900 on 17Sep and 900 on 26Sep.  
Negative depths reported at 0600 and 0630 on 4Sep are probably due to 
changes in atmospheric barometric pressure.  The low dissolved oxygen 
data from 18 to 30 Sep are anamolous, were not independently 
confirmed and may indicate debris or sediment in the sonde guard.
BY:  Salinity and conductivity data are about 20% lower than expected and 
their accuracy doubtful;  the lower values may have been caused by 
incorrect calibration or out of date calibration solutions.   
All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, 
specific conductivity and DO mg/L) from entire month.  During a 
deployment from 21 Aug to 30 Sep, oxygen data drifted slightly 
downward from 27 Aug to 31 Aug and readings should be interpreted 
with caution.  After retreival of the sonde on Sep 30, the D.O. 
membrane was intact and read 92.8% saturation when placed in water 
saturated air.  High and unexplained turbidities that probably do not 
reflect water quality conditions were recorded at 0800 on 6 sep, 2330 on 
16 Sep, 0630 on 17 Sep, 0200 on 19 Sep, and 0600 on 23 Sep.
NN:  High dissolved oxygen data from 9-12 Sep may be due to extensive algal 
mats in the slough.  After retrieval of the sonde on 3 Oct, the DO 
membrane was intact but had light fouling on the membrane and read 
92% saturation when placed in water saturated air.  A single high and 
unexplained turbidity value of 50 NTU was reported at 1330 on 3 Sep 
and probably does not reflect water quality conditions at the site.


October 1996
JL:  The low dissolved oxygen reported for the period 5Oct through 17Oct 
were not independently confirmed and may represent local conditions 
around the DO probe.  (The DO probe registered 94% in air saturated 
water when returned to the lab on 17Oct.)  The pH data from 1200 on 
1Oct through 1000 on 17 Oct seem anamolous and may be caused by 
accumulation of sediment in the sonde guard around the probe.  
Turbidity data from 0530 on 5Oct to 1000 on 17 Oct were erratic and 
negative alternating with periods of stable no change readings.  Data 
during this period have been removed.  The low dissolved oxygen 
reported from 22Oct to 30 Oct is anamolous and may be caused by 
sediment and/or debris in the sonde guard.  (The DO membrane was in 
good condition and read 98% saturation when returned to water 
saturated air in the lab.)  Negative depths reported for the following 
times are probably caused by changes in atmospheric barometric 
pressure:  0130 to 0730 on 18Oct, 0330 to 0630 on 19Oct and 0800 on 
21 Oct.
BY:   Anomalous low dissolved oxygen data were recorded at 0400 on 4 Oct, 
1100 on 4 Oct, and 2000 on 21 Oct; the cause is unknown and the 
readings may not reflect water quality conditions at the site.  Salinity 
and conductivity data are lower than expected and their accuracy 
doubtful;  the lower values may have been caused by incorrect 
calibration or out of date calibration solutions.  
All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, 
specific conductivity and DO mg/L) from entire month.  Small negative 
turbidity readings throughout the month may be due to inadequate 
cleaning of the turbidity probe surface prior to calibration and 
deployment.  Anamolous high turbidity value of 189 at 1230 on 30 Oct 
was removed; the cause is unknown.
NN:  Anomalous high and low dissolved oxygen fluctuations were reported on 
11 Oct from 8% to 101% in a 2 hour period after 2130; the cause is not 
known, however, after retreival of the sonde on 16 Oct, the D.O. 
membrane was intact and read 89.8% saturation when placed in water 
saturated air.  Negative depths reported on 4 Oct and 17-19 Oct are 
probably due to changes in atmospheric barometric pressure.  Very high 
turbidities (over 700 NTU) were recorded on 28 Oct.  Erratic data 
recorded from 0000 1 Oct through 1030 3 Oct were associated with low 
battery voltage and all parameters were removed from the data record.

November 1996
JL:  High and negative turbididty values from 0000 on 1Nov96 through 1430 
on 6Nov96 may be due to accumulation of debris caught in the sonde 
guard.  Low dissolved oxygen data during the same time period may also 
be due to accumulated sediment in the sonde guard.  When the sonde 
was retrieved at 1430 on 6Nov96, the DO membrane was intact and 
read 98% saturation when placed in water saturated air.
BY:  Salinity and conductivity data are lower than expected and their 
accuracy doubtful from 0000 1 Nov through 1000 on 1 Nov;  the lower 
values may have been caused by incorrect calibration or out of date 
calibration solutions;  the increase at 1030 on 1 Nov is due to the 
changeover of the YSI 6000 datalogger.  Both probes had been 
calibrated in standard solutions; the cause for the discrepancy is not 
known.  All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted 
(Salinity, specific conductivity and DO mg/L) from 0000 1 Nov96 through
1000 1 Nov96.  
Small negative turbidity readings throughout the month may 
be due to inadequate cleaning of the turbidity probe surface prior to 
calibration and deployment.  An anamolous high turbidity value of 132 
at 0300 on 10 Nov was removed; the cause is unknown.
NN:  Negative depths reported on 11 Nov are probably due to changes in 
atmospheric barometric pressure.  Negative depths reported from 15-30 
Nov are probably indicative of calibration errors; the depths indicate 
relative water height above the sensor.  Very high turbidities and 
negative turbidities were reported several times between 16 Nov and 30 
Nov.  These high values and negative values occurred almost always at 
times of high water depth and low salinities which are usually 
associated with times of high rainfall.  The high and negative turbidities 
may indicate mean water conditions at that time or may indicate debris 
caught on the window of the turbidity sensor.

December 1996
JL:  Negative depth values were reported for 2330 on 9 December and 
numerous times from 20Dec96 through 30Dec96; these negative depth 
readings are probably associated with changes in atmospheric 
barometric pressure.  Erratic readings for dissolved oxygen, pH, and 
turbidity from 0000 on 1Dec96 through 1030 on 19Dec96 were 
associated with accumulation of debris in the sonde guard: all DO, pH, 
and turbididty data were removed.  pH data from 11:30 on 19Dec96 
through 2330 on 31Dec96 are anamolous and suspect because of a 
possible failing probe.
BY:   Anomalous salinity decrease on 6 Dec from 1030 to 1130 was caused by 
a change in instruments; both probes had been calibrated in standard 
solutions; the cause for the discrepancy is not known.  Anomalous low 
dissolved oxygen data were recorded from 12-19 Dec (particularly a 
value of 42% at 0930 on 14 Dec); the cause is unknown.  The DO 
membrane was intact and read 101.7% saturation when placed in 
water saturated air after retrieval on 24 Jan 97.  High and unexplained 
turbidities that probably do not reflect water quality conditions at the 
site were recorded at 2130 on 13 Dec, 1930 on 18 Dec, and 1030 on 25 
Dec.
NN:  Negative depths reported from 1-31 Dec are probably indicative of 
calibration errors; the depths indicate relative water height above the 
sensor.  Temperatures below zero were recorded 27-31 Dec; these 
negative temperatures occurred when a very cold front remained over 
the watershed and when ice was observed on the surface of the slough 
and Padilla Bay.  Very high turbidities and negative turbidities (2 values 
<-1000 on 19 Dec were removed) were reported several times between 1-
20 Dec.  These high values and negative values (rollovers?) occurred 
almost always at times of high water depth and low salinities which are 
usually associated with times of high rainfall.  The high and negative 
turbidities may indicate mean water conditions at that time or may 
indicate debris caught on the window of the turbidity sensor.


11.	Missing data
January 1996
JL:  No data from 1430 on 11Jan96 through 23:30 on 31 Jan96 because the 
data were lost during file transfer.  No turbidity data because probe had 
not been received.  Low dissolved oxygen was not confirmed independently; therefore DO 
values considered suspect and deleted from 1/1/96 00:00 through 1/11/96 14:00.  
BY:  No data from 1030 on 10Jan96 through 23:30 on 31 Jan96 because the 
data were lost during file transfer.  No turbidity data because probe had 
not been received.

February 1996
JL:  No data from 00:30 on 1Feb96 through 14:30 on 18Feb96 because some 
data were lost during data capture and sonde was not deployed.  An 
electrical malfunction caused some sample times to be skipped: from 
3:30 on 22Feb to 10:30 on 23Feb; from 17:00 to 17:30 on 26Feb; and on 29Feb from 
6:00 to 14:00 and 
from 22:30 to 23:30.  Turbidity data are missing from the following times 
because of erratic and out of range values:  from 12:30 on 20Feb to 3:00 
on 22Feb; on 28Feb at 16:31:51; and from 14:31:51 to 22:01:51 on 
29Feb.
BY:  No data from 00:00 on 1Feb96 through 12:30 on 16Feb96 because some 
data were lost during file transfer and the Sonde was not deployed 
because of bad weather.  No salinity, specific conductivity, nor dissolved 
oxygen data for unknown reasons.  No turbidity data because probe 
had not been received.

March 1996
JL:  No data from 00:00 1Mar96 through17:30 on 2Mar96 because of 
equipment malfunction (sonde did not record).  No data from 13:30 on 
15Mar96 through 12:00 on 21Mar96 because the sonde was being 
cleaned and calibrated.  No tubidity data from 1800 on 2Mar96 through 
12:00 on 21Mar96 because probe was not functioning.  No turbidity 
reading at 1400 on 25Mar96 because value was removed because it was 
negative.
BY:  No data from 1330 to 1530 on 21 Mar 96 because the sonde was being 
cleaned, calibrated, and rotated.  No salinity or conductivity data from 
0000 on 1 Mar 96 to 1330 on 21Mar96 because unrealistic values were 
probably caused by incorrect calibration.  No dissolved oxygen from 
0000 on 1Mar96 to 1330 on 21Mar96 because probe and membrane 
were subjected to 7 days of unknown conditions between calibration 
and deployment.  No turbidity data all month: probe had not been 
installed 0000 1Mar96 to 1330 21Mar96 and values were erratic 
throughout the period 1600 21Mar96 to 2330 31Mar96.

April 1996
JL:  No data for all parameters at 08:00 on7Apr96 because battery was being 
replaced.  No data for all parameters from 13:00 on 11Apr96 through 
23:30 on 30Apr96 for cleaning, calibration, rotation of YSI 6000 sondes 
and fitting of one of the sondes with turbidity probe.  Turbidity values 
are missing on 4Apr96 at 08:30 and 10:00 because readings were 
negative.
BY:  No data from 0900 on 9Apr96 to 19Apr96 because the sonde was being 
cleaned, calibrated, and rotated.  No turbidity data all month because of 
erratic values throughout the month.  The sonde and probes were 
suspected to be periodically out of the on April 20, 21, and 22;  
therefore, all data during the times of low salinity were removed:  1130 
to 1330 on 20Apr96, 1200 to 1400 on 21Apr96, and 1330 to 1400 on 
22Apr96.

May 1996
JL:  No data for all parameters from 00:00 on 1May96 through 15:00 on 
16May96 for cleaning, calibration, rotation of YSI 6000 sondes and

30May96 for cleaning calibration and rotation of the sonde.  No 
dissolved oxygen data from 15:30 on 16May96 through 12:00 on 
30May96 because dissolved oxygen probe was not functioning properly 
(possibly a faulty D.O. membrane).
BY:   No data is reported for the following times because the sonde and probes 
were apparently out of the water and exposed during low water; all data 
during times of low salinity are missing:  0900-1030 on 2May, 0930-

cleaned, calibrated, and rotated.  No data is reported for 1 to 4 hours on 
the following dates because the sonde and probes were apparently out 
of the water and exposed during low water (salinity dropped to zero, 
depth dropped to very low or negative values): all data during times of 
low salinity are missing: June 1-6, 13-20, and 27-30.  All variables 
dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity, specific conductivity 
and DO mg/L) from entire month.  No turbidity data 
from 1000 on 19Jun96 to 2330 on 30Jun96 because the turbidity probe 
had not been installed on that sonde.

July 1996
JL:  No data except depth data are reported on 9Jul96 from 05:30 through 
11:30; the data were removed because the temperature readings ranged 
from 40 to 80 degrees Celsius.
BY:  No turbidity data from 0000 1Jul96 to 0900 on 19Jul96 because the 
turbidity probe had not been installed on that sonde.  No data is

probes were apparently out of the water and exposed during low water 
(salinity dropped to zero, depth dropped to very low or negative values): 
all data during times of low salinity are missing: July 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 
11, and 12.  All variables dependent on sal/cond were deleted (Salinity,

NN:  No data for all parameters at 1300 on 15Sep because sondes were being 
cleaned, calibrated and rotated.  No data for all parameters are reported 
from 1430 19 Sep through 2330 30 Sep because a sharp drop in battery 
voltage was associated with erratic readings from several probes, 
including temperature.

October 1996
JL:  No turbidity data on the following dates/times because readings were 
erratic with frequent high negative values:  from 0530 on 5Oct to 1000

erratic values associated with accumulated sediment in sonde guard.  
Missing dissolved oxygen data from 1400 on 26Nov96 to 2330 on 
30Nov96 because of accumulated sediment in sonde guard and 
suspected membrane puncture.  Missing pH data from 1400 on 26Nov96 
to 2330 on 30Nov96 because of accumulated sediment in the sonde 
guard and suspecting failing probe.
