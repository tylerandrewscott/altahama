2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6000 and the YSI 6600 into the 
EcoWatch (version 2.14) software, plotted, and initially analyzed for major 
anomalies and missing data. Hydrolab data are downloaded from the Hydrolab 
Datasonde 3 to PCPLUS software. Both YSI and Hydrolab raw data files are then 
downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) and imported into Microsoft Excel as 
a comma-space delimited file (.csv). These raw data files are then organized 
into standardized monthly data sets using the import.xls macros.   The 
import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, import the raw data, fill all 
empty cells with periods, change feet to meters for depth readings if necessary, 
and save the monthly files as either a .csv or .xls file.  Once in monthly 
format, these files are then run through the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which 
identify outliers, insure correct number of data points for each Date/Hour 
count, and format the columns in the correct order and size. The monthly files 
are then carefully edited by staff for data anomalies which are identified in 
Section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this document. Any data that are deleted by staff 
are replaced with periods and identified in Section 11. Monthly edited files are 
then FTP'd to CDMO in text format, along with an updated metadata form.  Kim Miller
 is responsible for data collection and QA/QC procedures. 

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the 
Tates Hell Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage 
period and allowed increased runoff with a concomitant increase in pH which 
had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  Because of this 
some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was done. A 
large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant allowed them to begin 
restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning 
the dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay allows the Reserve to 
monitor changes in water quality during this restoration effort. 

4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the 
NERRS national monitoring effort.  Prior to this, ANERR has been and continues 
to monitor three stations in the Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, 
using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's, while only two of these three sites are submitted 
to the CDMO for the System-Wide Monitoring Program.  East Bay (bottom) is one of 
these stations and is used in this monitoring program in addition to the YSI 
datalogger placed near the surface at this site. Both Hydrolab and YSI dataloggers 
are used at this station interchangeably as required.  
A vented YSI datalogger was used at the East Bay Surface site during the 
following deployments: August 9th, September 14th, October 24th and November 
26th. Prior to deployment, both the YSI 6000 and 6600 are calibrated for 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, turbidity and pH following the procedures 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual (with addendum 5/99). The 
Datasonde 3 is calibrated for conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth and pH 
following the procedures outlined in the Hydrolab Operating Manual, 
respectively.  Lab grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) are initially 
used to calibrate the YSI's, which are then used to check working standards made 
up and used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab grade standards are 
also used periodically to check the accuracy of the working salinity standards.  
The only variation from the manual is the use of two pH standards for two-point 
calibration of pH rather than three-point calibration.  The membranes for the 
dissolved oxygen probe are installed at least 12 hours prior to calibration.  
Depth is set to 0.0 meters in the lab.  A turbidity probe was added to the YSI 
6000's in December 1996 and is calibrated using a lab grade (Fisher Brand) 40 
NTU standard and deionized water (0 NTU).

In 2001, the task of wrapping the sonde in a wet, white towel during 
transportation for deployment and retrieval,  became a part of the standardized 
procedure for YSI 6-series multi-parameter sondes. During deployment and 
retrieval of the sondes, measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations and 
percent saturation, as well as, salinity and temperature, are taken at the sites 
using a hand-held YSI meter. 

Both YSI and Hydrolab dataloggers are deployed on the same piling within a five 
inch diameter stainless-steel tube with a locking cap. In order to maintain 
constant depth, the dataloggers are clamped to a pvc pipe and lowered into the 
tube, relinquishing the need for diving.  Large holes were cut in the tube where 
the probes are located to insure adequate circulation.  Every two or three weeks 
the dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected.  Freshly 
calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data 
gaps in the 30 minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the 
northwestern part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located 
adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola 
Bay system, including 52 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both 
natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a 
causeway and is located to the north of the bay proper.  The bay is 8.2 km long, 
has an average depth of approximately 1.0 m MHW, and an average width of 1.8 km. 
The tides in East Bay are mixed and range from 0.3 m to 1.0 m (average 0.5 m). 
The sampling site is located in the upper reaches of East Bay.  The 
piling location is latitude 29º 47.15' N and longitude 84º 52.52' W. At the 
sampling site, the depth is 2.2 m MHW and the width of the bay is 1 km.  The 
tides in the system are mixed, meaning the number of tides can range from one to 
five tides during a 24 hour period and are not evenly distributed throughout the 
day.  At the East Bay bottom site the meter probes are 0.3 m above the bottom 
sediment. Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt and the long term average salinity is 
approximately 8 ppt.  At the East Bay surface site the meter probes are 1.7 m 
above the bottom sediment and salinity ranges from 0 ppt to 30 ppt with a long 
term average salinity of 6.3 ppt.  Biofouling in the summer and fall months is
somewhat of a problem in East Bay, resulting in probes that will not calibrate
and data that is considered suspect.  Biofouling is related to temperature and 
salinity, which varies in East Bay.  Dissolved Oxygen readings drop to very low
values when these probes are heavily fouled with algae or mud.  The freshwater input 
is very tanic and usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are 
not quantified due to the diverse sources of the runoff. The bottom habitat at 
this bay site is soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with no vegetation 
present. The dominant marsh vegetation near the sampling site is Juncus roemerianus
 and Cladium jamaicense.  The dominant upland vegetation is primarily pineland 
forests which includes slash pine, saw palmetto, and sand pine.  Upland land 
use near the sampling site includes conservation and silviculture uses with some 
single family residential in the lower East Bay area.  The sampling site is influenced 
by local runoff from Tates Hell Swamp, the East Bay marshes, and distributary 
flow, some of which comes from the Apalachicola River via the East River.  
Tates Hell Swamp was ditched, diked, and altered back in the late 1960's and 
early 1970's by timber companies.  These changes shortened the drainage period 
and allowed increased runoff with a concomitant decrease in pH and increase in 
color, which had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  
Restoration of Tates Hell Swamp began in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff. 

6. Data collection period:
The dataloggers were first deployed at the East Bay Surface site on April 17, 
1995.  East Bay bottom sampling began on May 1, 1995. Both have been 
continuously in service since then. A Hydrolab Datasonde 3 datalogger is 
occasionally deployed at times when a YSI datalogger is unavailable for 
deployment. During the year 2001, however, all East Bay Surface and East Bay 
Bottom deployments utilized YSI dataloggers. Deployment dates and times for 2001 
follows.

8. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's to monitor water quality at three 
stations in Apalachicola Bay since May of 1992.  One of these stations was moved 
from the mid-bay area near the Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site 
in January of 1993.  The other two are located on two of the largest 
commercially important oyster bars in the bay.  These stations, like East Bay, 
are intended to be long-term. Other associated researchers and projects which 
have or continue to utilize this water quality data are:

12. Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.). to find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.
