2.    Entry verification:
      The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 sonde to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat). The comma-delimited files are 
imported into Excel 97 where they are formatted and processed by macros that are 
supplied by the CDMO. Various macros are designed to: 1) check data files for 
missing data points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods 
(.), 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and 
numeric variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the 
data logger's sensors and out the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 
5) save the files as Excel worksheets (*.xls).
      The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete 
the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range 
expected for the site, 2) outside the range established for the sensors, or 3) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved 
oxygen <28%).  Data are deleted if  the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor 
malfunction, 2) exposure of sensors during low tide,  or 3) fouling of sensors 
by aquatic organisms, debris, or sediment.  Sensor malfunctions are detected if 
the voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the 
sensor or the sensor will not calibrate.  Fouling of sensors is detected by 
comparing in-situ sensor readings with measurements  (see Research Methods 
section).  In addition, sensor readings that differ significantly (>10%) from 
standard solution (i.e., conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during 
deployment. After corrections are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the files 
are exported as tab-delimited files (*.txt) to the CDMO.  Christopher Graffeo, 
Mark Thompson, and Saundra Upchurch are responsible for these tasks.

3.    Research Objectives:
      Based/ on discussions with local CZM personnel and our knowledge of land 
use within the Reserve, the South Edisto River drainage basin appears well 
suited for studying contrasting hydrographic conditions and land use patterns. 
One NERR water quality monitoring station has been established near Edisto Beach 
within a tributary of Big Bay Creek.  Surrounded by residential and commercial 
development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is designated 
as the "treatment" site. The second NERR water quality monitoring station has 
been situated near Bailey Island, within a tributary of St. Pierre Creek.  Urban 
development in the immediate area of this station has been sparse to date so 
this station will serve as our "control" site. 
      The ACE Basin water quality monitoring program began on March 3, 1995 at 
two tributaries off Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks (see Site Location and 
Character section for description of sites).  YSI electronic data loggers were 
deployed to measure the water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved 
oxygen, pH, and turbidity conditions, approximately 0.1 meters above the creek 
bottom, at 30 minute intervals. Change in water level was also recorded. 

4.    Research methods
       Data loggers are deployed at a permanent monitoring station constructed 
at each site.  The station at Big Bay Creek was constructed in 1995, and it 
consists of a PVC pipe mounted vertically on 12-foot galvanized pole.  To 
facilitate water flow across the sensors, approximately two-inch diameter holes 
are drilled into the PVC pipes.  The pipes are also positioned to ensure that 
the sensors are approximately 0.1 meters from the creek bottom.  In 1997, the 
St. Pierre Creek station was modified: the PVC pipe is now mounted horizontally 
in a pyramid-shaped cage (2.5 ft long by 1.5 ft  high) tethered to the original 
12-foot galvanized pole.  Later that year, we began to put the data loggers in 
1/8-inch mesh net bags before placing them in the PVC pipe to reduce damage by 
crabs and fish. During the summer, the data loggers are left at the sites for 
one week, and the sampling period is extended to one month during the cooler 
months.
      At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are brought back to 
the laboratory for cleaning, calibration, and servicing, by methods outlined in 
the YSI Operating and Service Manual. Downtime for doing these procedures ranges 
from 24 to 48 hours. After cleaning the data loggers, the pH, conductivity, 
depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 
and 10, conductivity standard of 58.64mS/cm depth in the air, and turbidity 
standards of 0 and 100 NTU, respectively.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is 
replaced and is allowed to stretch for 24 hours before the DO sensor is 
calibrated in air-saturated water. In addition the procedures outlined in the 
manual, we conduct a DO membrane integrity test to determine if the membrane was 
punctured during deployment.
       Several quality assurance checks are used to determine if the sensor 
readings drifted significantly during deployment. In-situ measurements of 
dissolved oxygen, expressed in mg/L, salinity, and water temperature are taken 
during the first and last sampling interval.  Water samples are collected at the 
same depth as the sensors. Water temperature and salinity are measured directly 
with a thermistor and refractometer, respectively, and dissolved oxygen level is 
determined by the Winkler procedure.  Post- deployment measurements of all the 
parameters are taken before cleaning the data loggers.  Sensors are immersed in 
the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., pH) and readings are recorded. The 
results of these checks are used to evaluate the validity of the data (see Entry 
Verification section). 

5.    Site location and character:
      The two sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South Edisto 
River. The descriptions of the sites are as follows:
      Station A--this site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32  29.662N and 80 19.427W). Surrounded by residential and 
commercial development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is 
designated as the "treatment" site. Pollution sources include houses bordering 
the creek, many of them with little setbacks from the bordering Spartina marsh; 
forty docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and Wolmanized 
pilings; boat dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a paved road and 
three boat ramps off the creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA treated bulkheads 
and fueling areas located about 0.5 miles downstream; two commercial seafood 
docks with 8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three restaurants. The creek is 
closed to shellfish harvesting because of  the human development in the 
vicinity. Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh dominated by Spartina 
alterniflora with isolated areas of Salicornia. Upland fringe areas consist of 
cabbage palmetto, live oak and cedars. Reefs of American oyster (Crassostrea 
virginica) fringe the creek banks. At the time of reconnaissance, depth of the 
creek midway through ebb tide was 5 feet and salinity was 23 parts per thousand 
(ppt).

      Station B--this site is in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32 31.724N and 80 21.573W). It is surrounded by a wide expanse of 
Spartina alterniflora marsh. Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs fringe the 
banks.  Maritime forest communities comprised of species such as wax myrtles, 
live oaks, and palmettos dominate the upland areas.  Development in the 
immediate area is sparse. This creek is subject to relatively light boat 
traffic. At the time of reconnaissance, depth at low tide was 2.5 feet and 
salinity was 21 ppt. 

      The following discussions of trends in water quality at the monitoring 
stations are based on data collected from March 1995 through December 1997. 
During this period, water temperature at both monitoring sites exhibited a 
seasonal pattern with lowest values occurring in December-January.  The lowest 
monthly water temperature observed was 8.9oC which occurred in February 1996 at 
St. Pierre Creek.  Temperature maxima occurred in July and August with the 
highest monthly water temperature (30.9oC) occurring in July 1995 at Big Bay 
Creek.  Diurnal variation in temperature was evident with warmest temperatures 
occurring from 1300 hr to 1800 hr at both sites. Salinity also exhibited 
seasonal variability during the same period, with lowest values occurring in 
March at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks.  Another period of low average monthly 
salinity occurred at Big Bay Creek in December 1997.  Average annual salinity 
for both sites was in the polyhaline regime, with a mean of 29.4   at Big Bay 
Creek and 26.3  at St. Pierre Creek; however, for all years, salinity ranged 
from 0.3-41.7   at Big Bay and from 0- 41.7  at St. Pierre Creek.  Local 
precipitation and evaporation conditions are most likely the major contributors 
to monthly variability in salinity.  Analysis of the data indicates that tidal 
stage strongly influences salinity.  As expected, highest values of salinity 
occurred on the flood tide. 
      It appears that tidal stage also influences pH. Spectral analysis revealed 
a periodicity for pH and water depth with a sinusoidal period at ~ 12 hrs., 
representing tidal periodicity.  Time series plots of pH indicated variability 
of ~1 standard unit (su) on a daily basis. The pH at both sites was very 
similar, ranging from 5.3-8.4; however, the preponderance of measurements were 
>7 at both sites.  The pH observed at the two monitoring sites appear to be 
attributable to natural conditions. Marked variations in pH can also occur 
diurnally due to changes in primary production and respiration.
      Dissolved oxygen concentrations appear to tracked depth for part of the 
cycle, with lowest values occurring on low tides.  Afternoon and evening values 
were not as low as early morning values, suggesting a diurnal component.  
Dissolved oxygen values at the two monitoring sites were generally high 
throughout the year with averages of 83.6% saturation and 6.6 mg/l for Big Bay 
Creek and 78.5% saturation and 6.3 mg/l for St. Pierre Creek.  However, hypoxic 
events, as indicated by points below the reference line at 28% air saturation, 
were observed in every season but summer was clearly the season with the 
greatest percent of time that DO was ó 28%.  There were clearly differences 
among the sites with hypoxic conditions occurring over a greater percent of time 
at St. Pierre Creek. Seasonal periodicity explains most of the variations in 
dissolved oxygen concentrations at both sites, with highest mean concentrations 
in winter and lowest DO values in summer.
      Unlike the other parameters monitored at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks, 
there appears to be no distinct seasonal trend in turbidity; however, monthly 
variability appeared greater at the St. Pierre site. This may be due to 
fluctuations in the amount of detritus being washed form the extensive salt 
marsh and upland sites that surround St. Pierre Creek.

7.   Associated researchers and projects:
      In 1993, the Reserve staff initiated a long-term survey of the decapod 
crustaceans and juvenile fish that utilize the estuarine waters of the Reserve 
as a nursery ground. There are four sampling stations in each of the three major 
rivers, Ashepoo, Combahee and South Edisto, of the Reserve. Stations are located 
along a salinity gradient, ranging from polyhaline to oligohaline or limnetic. 
Sampling is done each month during daylight flood tide. Trawls are 10 minutes 
long and tows are made against the tide. Several physical parameters are 
measured at each station: air and water temperature, salinity, wind speed and 
direction, water depth and tidal stage. Cloud cover and rainfall conditions are 
also recorded at each station. To date, we have caught seventy-one species of 
fish and twenty-eight species of decapod crustacean species.
      Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews are assessing the distribution 
ofcontaminants (i.e., trace metals, PAHs, pesticides) in sediments within the 
rivers of the Reserve. Surface sediment grabs were collected from twelve sites 
in the Reserve. Ten sites are located along a salinity gradient in Ashepoo, 
Combahee and South Edisto rivers, and two sites are located in the vicinity of 
our data logger sites. Surface sediment grabs were collected in 1996 from each 
site, and the samples will be analyzed for trace metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, 
Zn, etc.), PAHs and pesticides.

a) The following records include low salinity readings that are less than 18 
ppt. These readings are not within normal polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 
and 40 ppt) for this site. The low readings were probably due to extremely low 
tides or heavy rainfall events.

a) During the following period, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during the December 11, 1997-January 6, 1998 
deployment by sediment from the nearby eroding bank. DO readings were extremely 
low (<1.0 mg/L), indicating that the DO membrane was blocked by debris or 
sediment. Post-deployment DO calibration check indicated that the DO membrane 
was not damaged by the fouling.

b) During the following period, the specific conductance and salinity data were 
deleted.  The readings drifted downward during similar time period as the DO 
downward drift, suggesting that the sediment from the eroding bank was the cause 
of  the low readings.

c) The following records include low salinity readings that are less than 18 
ppt. These readings are not within normal polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 
and 40 ppt) for this site. The low readings were probably due to extremely low 
tides or heavy rainfall events.

1998 deployment.
e) The following records include negative turbidity readings ranging from -700 
to -001; however, the data were not deleted.  The negative readings were caused 
by debris on the lens, a wiper malfunction, or animal interference. The post-
deployment check indicated that the turbidity functioned properly during 
deployment: turbidity read 0.4 NTU in 0 NTU standard and 112 NTU in 
100 NTU standard.

January 1-31, 1998 Sampling Period
   Big Bay
a) From 00:00 on January 1 to 23:30 on January 31, turbidity sensor was not 
installed. The sensor was   sent to YSI for repairs to the wiper gear box.
b) From 00:00 on January 1 to 09:00 on January 6, pH data were deleted because 
sensor malfunctioned during the December 11, 1997-January 6, 1998 deployment. 
The malfunction was probably caused by faulting controlling circuit of pH probe 
port. Data logger returned to YSI for repair, and another unit (#95a28372) was 
deployed at site. 
c) From 09:30 on January 6 to 10:00 on January 13, no data are available due to 
downtime for servicing and calibrating of data loggers.
d) From 10:30 on January 13 to 23:30 on January 31, pH data were deleted because 
probe malfunctioned during the January 13-February 5 deployment, as determined 
by post-deployment check. The probe read pH 7 while immersed in the pH 10 
standard solution.

a) During the following period, the dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the sensor was fouled during the December 11, 1997-January 6, 1998 
deployment by sediment from the nearby eroding bank. DO readings were extremely 
low (<1.0 mg/L), indicating that the DO membrane was blocked by debris or 
sediment.  However, a post-deployment DO calibration reading of 102% air sat.   
indicated that the DO membrane was not damaged by the fouling.

deleted because the DO membrane was accidentally punctured prior to deployment. 
Unfortunately, a membrane integrity test was not conducted; however similar 
results occurred when the DO sensor was switched from the air saturated storage 
cup to the saltwater environment and then back to an air saturated storage 
cup. The reading immediately rose from 100% to 600% air saturation when the data 
logger was deployed at the site, and immediately dropped to 100% air saturation 
when switched from the saltwater to the air saturated environment.
