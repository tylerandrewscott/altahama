2. Entry Verification:

	The data are reviewed using the YSI computer program PC6000 that 
accompanies the YSI 6000 data logger.  After the file is uploaded from the 
datalogger, PC6000 is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.) The information obtained from this 
is used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when 
the datalogger was removed from the water or those caused by instrument failure.  
The data are imported into a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current 
month's cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of data has been recorded 
the file is ready for review.  The data review includes several steps.  The 
first step is to format the data using the CDMO Excel 5.0 macro so that the 
parameter columns are in the correct order and the data has the correct number 
of decimal place holders as specified by the NERR CDMO.  Secondly, the Excel 
macro is used to determine if there are any dates and times that data was not 
recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  Missing dates 
and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells 
where data would normally be.  The reason for the missing data is recorded on 
the metadata document.  Next, the data are filtered using the Excel macro to 
find readings outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range 
for the site in question.  Data outside the instrument range is/are removed from 
the file and a period is inserted to the cell(s).  An explanation for the 
missing dates and times are recorded onto the metadata document.  Data that was 
outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site is 
investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, 
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  If the data is/are rejected from 
the file a period is inserted to the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing 
dates and times are recorded onto metadata document. The completed Metadata  
form is the submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Jane Garbisch was 
responsible for all 1999 data management.  

3.  Research Objectives:
	Sapelo Island is only accessible by passenger ferry.  Due to its 
isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the SINERR show little evidence of 
human impact.  Thus the Marsh Landing dock, the primary access point for the 
approximately 200-300 residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off 
loading was chosen as the most directly impacted site.  The lower Duplin site is 
also readily accessible and centrally located within the SINERR.  The University 
of Georgia Marine Institute has used this site for years and SINERR continues to 
do so.  The Hunt Dock site was selected in July 19999 for monitoring.  It is a 
dock only used for transporting hunters during the fall season.  It is further 
up the Duplin, where the primary usage of the river is for pleasure boating and 
crabbing.  Therefore it is the unimpacted site.  

4.   Research Methods:

	The Water Quality Monitoring began in October of 1999, at the Marsh 
Landing Dock on the lower Duplin River.  At this time we are only performing 
long term water quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.  Prior to 
April 15, 1999 the sampling was done by the University of Georgia-Athens Marine 
Institute (UGAMI). When SAP NERR took over the NERR monitoring from the 
University of GA, a second site was set up at the Marsh Landing site to be the 
NERR monitoring station.  In order to lesson the confusion between the 2 sites, 
the SAP NERR site is referred to as the Lower Duplin site (LD) and is monitored 
at a fixed depth from the bottom (0.5m).  The University continues to monitor at 
a fixed depth just below the surface (Marsh Landing) but this site is no longer 
considered a NERR monitoring station.  The Flume Dock (FD) is also monitored by 
the University, but data is not reported to the SAP NERR anymore.  Therefore the 
Hunt Dock (HD) site was established just south of the Flume Dock site as the new 
upper duplin site and also measures at 0.5m above the surface bottom.  At the 
time of changing over the monitoring program, some changes were made and are 
noted at the end of this section.

	Before each YSI PC6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and maintenance 
is performed following the manufacturer's instructions.  Calibration standards 
are only required for pH, conductivity, and turbidity, all other parameters are 
done as described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 
and 10) are purchased from a scientific supply house.  The conductivity standard 
is made using a 0.2 M solution of KCl (24.82mS/cm = 14.92 g/L) or from serial 
dilution of a certified conductivity standard.  The turbidity calibration uses 
distilled water made by the University of Georgia-Athens Marine Institute.  The 
dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit 
at least 24 hours prior to deployment.  Calibration is then verified by running  
a standard as a sample after each calibration.*  

	During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in 
the field observation log.*  The datalogger is placed inside a length of PVC 
pipe attached to the dock.  The Lower Duplin datalogger is attached to the north 
side of a fixed height dock by a stell cable and run down a PVC pipe to rest 
0.5m above the surface bottom.  The Hunt Dock data logger is attached to the 
south side of a fixed dock by steel cable and run down a PVC pipe to take 
measurements 0.5m above the surface bottom.  Every 30 minutes during the 
sampling period measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, 
salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, percent saturation, depth and 
turbidity.

	During the stage of deployment the datalogger is checked for fouling and 
cleaned.  This can be one to three times a week depending on the time of year.  
At the end of the sample period the datalogger is retrieved and immediately 
replaced by another calibrated datalogger.  The datalogger is then taken to the 
lab and runs QA/QC standards for pH, and conductivity, and dissolved oxygen, the 
data is uploaded, and the probe is cleaned.

* all the aforementioned were incorporated into the procedure April 15, 1999.  
Before this date, no QA/QC samples were run, nor was there any field log kept.

5.  Site Location and character:
	
	The monitoring site is located on the Marsh Landing Dock in the Duplin 
River on Sapelo Island.  Water passing the Marsh landing site during flood tide 
originates from the Doboy Sound.  The Doboy receives input from the Atlantic 
Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway. The water 
is pushed up the river or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the 
marsh surface by the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb 
tide.
	The dock itself is used as the main dock to the island where the ferry 
makes several daily runs.  There are also several small boats that are docked 
there.  The surrounding area vegetation is dominated by salt marsh with Spartina 
being the predominate flora. Latitude and longitude for Lower Duplin site is as 
follows:  31 deg 25’ 4” N, 81 deg 17’ 46” W); Latitude and longitude for Hunt 
Camp site is as follows: ( 31 deg 28’ 43”, 81 deg 16’ 23” W); Tidal range 
maximum for both sites is 14 feet and the salinity range is 5-35 ppt.  Because 
the previous data from 1995-1998 was measured at a fixed depth closer to the 
surface, a base line range has not been established for parameters in the 1999 
data.  

	The Hunt Dock monitoring site is located on the Duplin River, off of Moses 
Hammock, which is separated by Sapelo Island by a small tidal channel.  The 
primary runoff at the site is from tidal creeks flowing through Spartina marsh 
and through the mud. There is little human traffic this far up the Duplin and 
it is north of the people living on Sapelo.

7.  Associated researchers and projects:

Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the 
University of Georgia Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the island became 
a working laboratory for many.  The research continues today with SINERR and 
UGAMI creating a unique partnership with much of the current research being done 
facilitated by SINERR and UGAMI together.  Given UGAMI's long history on Sapelo, 
a bibliographic list of over 800 articles of current and previous research can 
be found on the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/UGAMI).

October 1999
During the month of October there are several hunts on the island.  The sonde is 
deployed at the dock used by the deer hunters that come and go by small boat.  
This could explain the turbidity fluctuations.

b.) 10/12/99 2:00, 6:00, 8:00 - 11:00, 12:30 Turbidity readings high
c.) 10/13/99 16:30 turbidity reading high, removed from data
d.) Turbidity data for the following times are greater than 1000 NTU and 
negative but remain in the database.
