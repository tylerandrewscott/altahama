2. Entry Verification:

	The data are reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowatch that 
accompanies the YSI 6000/6600 data logger.  After the file is uploaded from the 
datalogger, Ecowatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.) The information obtained from this 
is used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when 
the datalogger was removed from the water or those caused by instrument failure.  
The data are imported into a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current 
month's cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of data has been recorded 
the file is ready for review.  The data review includes several steps.  The 
first step is to format the data using the Excel macros provided by CDMO. The 
CDMO macros will allow the user to automatically format column widths to the 
correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor specifications.  It also 
allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated file for missing data 
points, fill all cells that do not contain data with periods, and find all data 
points that fall outside the range of what the data logger is designed to 
measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users with 30 
minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week 
deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in November 1999 
a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to produce single 
parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.  Secondly, the Excel 
macro is used to determine if there are any dates and times that data was not 
recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  Missing dates 
and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells 
where data would normally be.  The reason for the missing data is recorded on 
the metadata document. 
Data that was outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site 
is 
investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, 
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  If the data is/are rejected from 
the file a period is inserted to the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing 
dates and times are recorded onto metadata document. The completed Metadata  
form is the submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Jane Garbisch was 
responsible for all 2000 data collection and management.  

3. Research Objectives:
Hydrological studies (Ragotskie and Bryson, 1955: Imberger et al., 1983) have 
shown that there are three tidal excursions along the length of the Duplin 
River, resulting in three distinct water masses.  The two monitoring sites in 
the Duplin River, called the Lower Duplin site and the Hunt Camp site, are 
located within the lower and upper water masses, respectively.  Water passing 
the Lower Duplin site during flood tide has come from Doboy Sound, which 
receives input from the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway and from 
the Atlantic Ocean.  The water in the lower water mass is pushed further up the 
Duplin or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh surface by 
the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb tide.  The water in 
the upper water mass, which passes the Hunt Camp station, is pushed up small 
creek channels and onto the marsh at each high tide.  Thus the two stations 
monitor conditions in two hydrologically separate water masses, one of which is 
heavily influenced by exchanges with Doboy Sound and the other, which is 
influenced by its twice daily contact with the marsh surface.  
	Sapelo Island is only accessible by passenger ferry.  Due to its 
isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the SAP NERR show relatively 
little 
evidence of 
human impact.  Thus the Marsh Landing (ML) dock, where the Lower Duplin site is 
located,  the primary access point for the 
approximately 200-300 residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off 
loading was chosen as the most directly impacted site.  The Lower Duplin site is 
also readily accessible and centrally located within the SAP NERR.  The 
University 
of Georgia Marine Institute has used this as a monitoring site for years and 
SAP NERR continues to 
do so.  The Hunt Dock(HD) site was selected in July 1999 for monitoring.  It is 
a 
dock only used for transporting hunters during the fall season.  It is further 
up the Duplin, where the primary usage of the river is for pleasure boating and 
crabbing.  Therefore it is the unimpacted site.  The University of Georgia-
Athens continues to monitor further up the Duplin ant the Flume Dock site.

4.   Research Methods:

	The SAP NERR Water Quality Monitoring began in October of 1999, at the 
Marsh 
Landing (ML) Dock on the lower Duplin River.  At this time we are only 
performing 
long term water quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.  Prior to 
April 15, 1999 the sampling was done by the University of Georgia-Athens Marine 
Institute (UGAMI). When SAP NERR took over the NERR monitoring from the 
University of GA, a second site was set up at the Marsh Landing site to be the 
NERR monitoring station.  In order to lesson the confusion between the 2 sites, 
the SAP NERR site is referred to as the Lower Duplin site (LD) and is monitored 
at a fixed depth from the bottom (0.5m).  The University continues to monitor at 
a fixed depth just below the surface (Marsh Landing) but this site is no longer 
considered a NERR monitoring station.  The Flume Dock (FD) is also monitored by 
the University, but data is not reported to the SAP NERR anymore.  Therefore the 
Hunt Dock (HD) site was established just south of the Flume Dock site as the new 
upper Duplin site and also measures at 0.5m above the surface bottom.  

	Before each YSI PC6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and maintenance 
is performed following the manufacturer's instructions.  Calibration standards 
are only required for pH, conductivity, and turbidity, all other parameters are 
done as described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 2 point calibration (pH 7 
and 10) are purchased from a scientific supply house.  The conductivity standard 
is made using a 0.2 M solution of KCl (24.82mS/cm = 14.92 g/L) or from serial 
dilution of a certified conductivity standard.  The turbidity calibration uses 
distilled water made by the University of Georgia-Athens Marine Institute and a 
purchased 100 NTU certified standard.  The 
dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit 
at least 24 hours prior to deployment.  Calibration is then verified by running  
a standard as a sample after each calibration. 

	When deployed the weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in 
the field observation log. The datalogger is placed inside a length of PVC 
pipe attached to the dock.  The Lower Duplin datalogger is attached to the north 
side of a fixed height dock by a steal cable and run down a PVC pipe to rest 
0.5m above the surface bottom.  The Hunt Dock (HD) data logger is attached to 
the 
south side of a fixed dock by steel cable and run down a PVC pipe to take 
measurements 0.5m above the surface bottom. Because of the large tidal range, 
water is continually flushed through the pvc pipes, thus eliminating the problem 
of creating a stagnate column of water with in the pipe with data logger. Every 
30 minutes during the 
sampling period measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, 
salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, percent saturation, depth and 
turbidity.

	During the stage of deployment the datalogger is checked for fouling and 
cleaned.  This can be one to three times a week depending on the time of year.  
At the end of the sample period the datalogger is retrieved and immediately 
replaced by another calibrated datalogger.  The datalogger is then taken to the 
lab and run QA/QC standards for pH, and conductivity, and dissolved oxygen, the 
data is uploaded, and the sonde is cleaned.  Data is removed if postcalibration 
standards fail or if technical problems are noted.  All data removed is noted 
for the metadata.


5.  Site Location and character:
	
	The monitoring site is located on the Marsh Landing Dock in the Duplin 
River on Sapelo Island.  Water passing the Marsh landing site during flood tide 
originates from the Doboy Sound.  The Doboy receives input from the Atlantic 
Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway. The water 
is pushed up the river or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the 
marsh surface by the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb 
tide.
	The dock itself is used as the main dock to the island where the ferry 
makes several daily runs.  There are also several small boats that are docked 
there.  The surrounding area vegetation is dominated by salt marsh with Spartina 
being the predominate flora. Latitude and longitude for Lower Duplin site is as 
follows:  31 deg 25' 4" N, 81 deg 17' 46" W); Latitude and longitude for Hunt 
Camp site is as follows: (31 deg 28' 43", 81 deg 16' 23" W); Tidal range 
maximum for both sites is 14 feet and the salinity range is 5-35 ppt. 


	The Hunt Dock (HD) monitoring site is located on the Duplin River, off of 
Moses 
Hammock, which is separated by Sapelo Island by a small tidal channel.  The 
primary runoff at the site is from tidal creeks flowing through Spartina marsh 
and through the mud. There is little human traffic this far up the Duplin and 
it is north of the people living on Sapelo. During the fall, the Hunt dock and 
Moses Hammock is the camping and docking site for deer hunters traveling to the 
island.  These are controlled hunts and dates are available from the SAP NERR 
office if needed.

8.  Associated researchers and projects:

Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the 
University of Georgia Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the island became 
a working laboratory for many.  The research continues today with SAP NERR and 
UGAMI creating a unique partnership with much of the current research being done 
facilitated by SAP NERR and UGAMI together.  Given UGAMI's long history on 
Sapelo, 
a bibliographic list of over 800 articles of current and previous research can 
be found on the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/UGAMI).

working properly.
d. 6/12 700- 7/5/1300 noted increase in data values from last deployment.  
Calibration verifications within acceptable range. It is possible that summer 
fouling degraded probes over last deployment and cleaner probes are reading 
higher values.

July 2000
a. 6/12 700- 7/5/1300 noted increase in data values from last deployment.  
Calibration verifications within acceptable range. It is possible that summer 
fouling degraded probes over last deployment and cleaner probes are reading 
higher values. New sonde put in 7/5, DO still reading high, though not as high, 
other parameters drop a bit in value also.  
b. 7/1 000-7/5 1300, DO very high (>100%), all lab tests confirm DO working 
properly. Yet possible that membrane is faulty.
c. 7/28 1000, 1600 Turbidity spike, cause unknown

August 2000
a. 8/25 1830 - 8/31 2330 Due to breakage of the pH probe, sonde was deployed 
without pH probe.  The sonde was not reprogrammed for this change and continued 
to output numbers for pH, though there was no probe.  All of this erroneous data 
was removed.

12. Other Remarks:
Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
