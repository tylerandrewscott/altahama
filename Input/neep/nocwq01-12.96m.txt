2)Entry Verification Process:


The data are reviewed using the computer program PC6000 that

accompanies the YSI 6000 datalogger.  After the file is uploaded 

from the water quality instrument, PC6000 is used to plot the data and

perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.

dev.). This information is printed out and attached to the Field

Log for the particular deployment. This printout is used during

file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when

the water quality instrument was removed from the water or those

caused by instrument failure. The data are imported into a

Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative

recordings. When a complete month of data has been recorded the

file is ready for review. The data review includes several steps.

The first step is to format the data so that the parameter

columns are in the correct order and the data have the correct

number of decimal place holders. Secondly, an Excel macro is used

to check for any dates and times that data were not recorded due

to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates

and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted

into the cells where data would normally be. An explanation for

the missing data is recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.

Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro to find readings

outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range

for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are

removed from the file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).

An explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto

the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside the "normal" range of

water quality for a particular site were investigated for

validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks,

PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics. If the data are

rejected from the file a period is inserted into the cell(s) and

an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto

the Water Quality Editing Log. The information recorded on the

Water Quality Editing Log is transferred to the metadata form.

The metadata form is then submitted with the data file to the

CDMO.  Paul Grimshaw initially reviewed and edited the 1996 data.  William 
Thompson 

reviewed and re-edited the 1996 data and metadata.  



3)Research Objectives:


Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island

and Zeke's Island components of North Carolina's National

Estuarine Research Reserve and are anchored to the bottom of the

selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30 minute intervals for

approximately two week periods. These sites are relatively 

unimpacted by manmade perturbations. 









4)Research Methods:


The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March

1992 at the Masonboro Island component, and 19 May 1994 at the

Zeke's Island component. The procedures described below were

instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover data recorded

previously. At this time we are only performing long term water

quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.



Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is

performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual 

addendum 7/94, sections 3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are only

required for pH, turbidity and salinity; all other parameters are done as 

described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 3 point pH calibration 

(pH 4,7 and 10) are purchased premade from a scientific supply house. Turbidity 
standards 

are also purchased premade from a scientific supply house.  The 

salinity standard is obtained from filtered seawater taken from Masonboro

Sound and analyzed at the Center for Marine Science Research (CMSR)in

Wilmington, NC using an osmometer. The dissolved oxygen membranes

are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24

hrs prior to deployment. 



During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are

recorded in the field observation log. Measurements of DO, pH,

salinity, specific conductance, and temperature are taken with

a calibrated YSI 6000 or other field instruments to check the 

accuracy of the instrumentation before deployment (as of October 

1995). The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked steel

cage, then anchored to the bottom, and chained to a post at the 

monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 

measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity,

dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration,

depth, pH, and turbidity. 



At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is

either brought back to the laboratory or serviced in the field.

If the water quality instrument is serviced in the field the DO

sensor is either replaced with one that has a new membrane or the

old membrane is wiped with lens paper moistened with tap water to

remove biofouling. The weather and water quality measurements are

again noted in the field observation log. The calibration drift

and the effect of biofouling on the water quality instrument are

checked by comparing data readings in calibration standards or

against a recently calibrated YSI 6000. The water quality data Is

then uploaded, and the instrument is cleaned and calibrated as 

noted previously. The water quality instrument is then ready to

be redeployed.



5)Site Location and Character:


The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine

Research Reserve (from north to south) are: Currituck Banks,

Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island. They are

located along the southeastern coast of the United States in the

Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro and Zeke's

Island components are transferred to the CDMO. The two sites are: 



1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island

The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of

Whiskey Creek, and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a

small navigable channel called Research Creek at 34 deg 09'21.7"

latitude and 77 deg 50'59.9" longitude (GPS position). The site

has a salinity range of 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages

1.2 meters.



2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island

The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal

Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33 deg 56'23.5"

latitude and 77 deg 56'28.1" longitude (GPS position). This site

receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear

River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies

of water. Thus, the ocean tidal input through New Inlet is a

major factor in maintaining the high salinity; however during

rainy periods major drops in salinity may occur. The site has a

salinity range of 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2

meters.



6)Data Collection Period


Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while

East Cribbing data collection commenced on 19 May 1994. All

monitoring is considered long term.

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zeke’s Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserve’s historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.


10) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section lists data that are extreme for the aquatic system

being monitored or are outside the measurement range of the 

instrument.  The cause of such anomalies may be a bad calibration,

boat traffic disturbances, or a malfunction of the instrument.

11) Missing data:


Approximately every 2-3 weeks, there is a period of between 1 to



24 hrs (occasionally longer) of missing data due to maintenance



and calibration. During the maintenance period all parameters

will be missing.



A record and explanation of missing data that are not related to

routine maintenance is kept in the field log for the particular

deployment. All parameters recorded when the water quality

instrument is exposed to air during a sample, either by an

extremely low tide or physical displacement from its original

location, are removed. Special note should be made regarding

missing dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (%), DO concentration

(mg/l), specific conductance, salinity, and temperature

measurements. If the DO saturation (%) data are removed, due to

sensor malfunction or other circumstances, the  DO concentration

(mg/l) will also be missing. The DO concentration (mg/l) is

calculated from DO saturation (%) and temperature data. This is also

true for specific conductance and salinity data. Salinity (ppt)

is determined by the YSI 6000 using specific conductance and

temperature data.  If the temperature sensor malfunctions and the 

corresponding data are removed, all parameters requiring these data (DO 

saturation, DO concentration, specific conductance, salinity, and pH)

will also be removed.
