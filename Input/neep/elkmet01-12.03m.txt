2) Entry verification:
The meteorological information is sampled every 5 seconds from each instrument on the weather station and 
stored on a Campbell Scientific CR10X storage module.  Two programs were used to output the data during 
the year 2003.  The first CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr.csi) controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule from January 01 through November 18 (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule).  The second program (NERR_4.CSI) was associated to the CR10X on November 18, 
2003. In both programs the 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data are downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a storage module.  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W 
software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  Data from the storage module is then uploaded and backed up 
monthly on the NERR IBM compatible personal computer. With the first program the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  The WDMP program was developed in 
Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly 
raw data file into and Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the 
comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and summary 
reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data 
corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction section below.  These data were then converted 
to match the format of the current program (NERR_4.CSI).

The new program NERR_4.csi, data are output to a file in three arrays: array 15 stores 15 minute average, 
max and min data; array 60 stores hourly average, max and min data; and array 144 stores daily average, 
max and min data.  Files are exported from PC208W or LoggerNet in a comma-delimited format (.DAT) and opened 
in Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro (EQWinFormat.xls) that was 
developed by the CDMO to reformat the header columns, insert station codes, insert a date column 
(mm/dd/yyyy), correct the time column format and reformat the data to the appropriate number of decimal 
places.  The pre-processed file is then ready to be copied into the EQWin weather.eqi file where the data are 
QA/QC checked and archived in a database.  EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data 
set outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure) and large 
changes in the data.  EQWin is also used to generate statistics, view graphs, create customized 
queries and reports of the data, cross query the water, weather and nutrient data and finally export the data to 
the CDMO.  Any anomalous data are investigated and noted below in the Anomalous Data/Suspect Data 
section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Deleted Data section below.

b) Data Collection Schedule (nerr.csi program). Data from this program were formatted to match collection 
format of the new NERR_4.csi program.

i) Data are collected in the following formats:
1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation data that are totalized 
from 5-second samples sorted by date and time. (Arrays 150 and 151) in nerr.csi program and 15 in 
NERR_4.CSI program. 
       
2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102 in nerr.csi program and 60 in NERR_4.CSI program) are 
calculated from 5 second samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 
are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106 in nerr.csi program and 60 in 
NERR_4.CSI program).

3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242 in nerr.csi program and 144 in NERR_4.CSI program),

NERR_4.CSI program) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted by date and time except for 
PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 
246 in nerr.csi program and 144 in NERR_4.CSI program).

3) Research objectives:
The principle objectives are to record meteorological information for the Elkhorn Slough  NERR's site that 
can be used 1) as a vital reference of atmospheric data for various research projects at the reserve -- an 
integral part of our general NERR mission is to provide a platform for estuarine research, 2) to give 
meteorological context (atmospheric-forcing) for our half-hourly SWMP water quality data, and other long-
term environmental monitoring programs at the Reserve (including nutrients and shoreline change), 3) to 
observe and characterize important events, such as storms, heat and cold waves, droughts and heavy 
rainfalls, and 4) to detect trends and characterize climate variability over the long-term. 4) Research 
methods: The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds continuously throughout the 
year.  These data are used by the CR10X to produce 15 minute averages, maximum and minimums (array 
15), hourly averages, maximums and minimums (array 60) and daily averages, maximums and minimums 
(array 144) of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed, and wind 
direction.  In 2003 we used a 1 month sampling interval. CR10X raw data are currently stored on storage 
modules that are brought back to the office and uploaded to the Elkhorn Slough NERR computer. All 
collected data are quality checked immediately after the monthly downloads using EQWin.  The reports, 
graphs and queries of meteorological data are printed and reviewed.  Any errors or anomalous data are 
further investigated and the data are either corrected or deleted (if necessary) or commented on and left 
unchanged.

Sensors on the weather station are inspected monthly for damage or debris. The rain gauge tends to collect 
debris and is cleaned out every month, particularly before and after major storms events.  Sensors are 
removed and calibrated on an annual or biannual basis depending on the particular sensor. Also, once a 
month on download day, we use a handheld Kestrel 4000, to run a comparative set of observations as a 
general check on the Campbell station sensors.  

5) Site location and character:
The Elkhorn Slough NERR is located on the central California coast at the head of the Monterey Bay (36 
deg 48' 55.44" N 121 deg 44' 16.8" W). There is one weather station on the reserve that is located 
approximately one kilometer south of the South Marsh water quality site. The sensors are located on a 10 ft 
tower placed according to descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual V 5.0 and are located approximately 
200 feet above the marsh on a bluff in the uplands of the marsh. The tipping bucket is located to the west 
away from the tower. There are no shadow or wind obstructions from buildings or trees in the immediate 
area surrounding the location of the sensors.

6) Data collection period:
Weather data has been collected since September 18, 1998. 

7) Distribution:  
According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy for the NERRS 
System-wide Monitoring Program, NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish 
summaries of the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program data.  The PI retains the right to be fully 
credited for having collected and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standards, the PI and 
NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent 
publications in which any part of the data are used.  Manuscripts resulting from this NOAA/OCRM 
supported research that are produced for publication in open literature, including refereed scientific journals, 
will acknowledge that the research was conducted under an award from the Estuarine Reserves Division, 
Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only as good as the 
quality assurance and quality control procedures outlined by the enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The

NERR weather data and metadata can be obtained from the Research Coordinator at the individual NERR 
site (please see section 1. Principal investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the 
Centralized Data Management Office (please see the CDMO Staff link on the CDMO home page) and 
online at the CDMO home page http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/.  Data are available in text format.

8) Associated researchers and projects:
Rain data from the weather station are shared with the Naval Post Graduate School who in turn organize 
these data from many stations in the county. These weather data are also combined with water quality data 
for analysis and correlations with rain events.

10) Coded variable definitions:
Site definitions: 
ELKCWMET= Elkhorn Slough Caspian Weather Station Meteorological Data

11) Anomalous Data/Suspect Data:
COMMENT 1:  The error message "wind direction greater than 360 or less than 0" can occur when slightly 
negative wind directions (0 to –10) are recorded. This occurs when the wind direction is in the extreme 
NNW (between 350 and 360). The data can be adjusted (if interested) by adding 360 to the slightly negative 
values.

COMMENT 2: 15 min sample rainfall amount differences of over 5mm in 15 minutes can occur during 
storms and indicate intense precipitation bursts during thunderstorms or frontal passages. 

COMMENT 3: Relative humidity differences greater than 25% between 15 min samples are not unusual 
with frontal passages and are usually associated with wind shifts. 

COMMENT 4. Air temp differences between 15 min samples greater than 3 degrees are not unusual with 
frontal passages and are usually associated with wind shifts.

COMMENT 5. Wind speed was less than 0.5 m/s for more than 12 hours.  During these times, the wind 
speed data was corrected due to an instrument calibration error.  These gaps of low wind speeds are not 
unusual for this site.  The wind speeds can be calm for long periods of time.

COMMENT 6. Missing Data Comment 2: When the CR10X is powered down for maintenance or other 
causes or the program reloaded, all temporary 5 sec data for that calendar date are lost at the moment of 
power down. When the CR10X is powered again the 5 sec data from that point on for that date are again 
stored in the daily temporary file for that calendar date. Consequently, the daily averages, maximums and 
minimums for all parameters, which are calculated for the calendar date using the 5 sec data file, will be 
incorrect for the calendar date because only a portion of the day's data will used for calculation.  The same 
applies to the hourly and 15 minute averages, maximums and minimums for the time period immediately 
following a power down event. Current protocol is to delete the daily data for these dates as well as any 
hourly and 15 minute averages so affected. 

COMMENT 7. Missing Data Comment 3: Due to the fact that we never really knew the instant the power 
down events occurred, it was difficult to determine the exact times without looking more closely at the data. 
The hourly data was not deleted based on our observation of continuous and reasonable data.  The hourly 
data for each of the following power-down events looked reasonable and more importantly continuous; 
therefore the data was not deleted.

September
PAR 15, 60 and 144 arrays data are suspect from 09/26/2003 0000 through 11/18/2003 1600 because of 
increasing evening readings throughout this period. 

November
From 11/01/03 through 11/16/03 daily averages for Wind Speed are outliers and are not representative of the 
average of all 15-minute data for that day. These have been deleted and substituted with an average of all 
15-minute data from that day.

12) Deleted data:

November 2003
15 minute Data from 11/18/2003 at 15:30 to 15:45, 60-minute data from 11/18/2003 at 16:00, and 24 hour 
Data on 11/18/2003 were deleted because of CR10X power-down event.

PAR data are missing from 11/18/2003 1600 through the end of the year due to the wrong calibration 
number inputted into the CR10X program thus data were incorrect from this point through the end of the 
year. PAR 15, 60 and 144 arrays data were deleted.

13) Missing data:

November 2003
All 15-minute data from 11/17/2003 at 13:45 through 11/18/2003 at 15:15, 60-minute data from 11/17/2003 
at 14:00 though 11/18/2003 at 15:00, and 24 hour Data on 11/17/2003 are missing due to storage module 
malfunction.  

14) Other Remarks/notes
Power down on 11/18/03 at 15:1715 minute Data from 11/18/2003 at 15:30 to 15:45, 60-minute data from 
11/18/2003 at 16:00, and 24 hour Data on 11/18/2003 were deleted.

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 11/18/2003, all values less than 0 were altered 
in the raw data to read 0.  These values may indicate an incorrect multiplier, calibration problems, or a 
sensor malfunction.  Because these values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all 
valid data points. 
 
Relative Humidity: 
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 11/18/2003, all values over 100% were altered 
in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super saturated air, calibration problems, or a 
sensor malfunction.  Because these values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all 
valid data points.
