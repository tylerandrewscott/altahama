2.	Entry verification:
		The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 and/or a 
Model 6600EDS sonde to comma-delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat). 
The comma-delimited files are imported into Excel 98 where they are formatted 
and processed by macros that are supplied by the Centralized Data Management 
Office (CDMO). Various macros are designed to: 1) check data files for missing 
data points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods (.), 3) 
convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and numeric 
variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the data 
logger's sensors and output the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) 
save the files as Excel worksheets (*.xls).
	The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete 
the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range 
expected for the site, 2) outside the range of measurements established for the 
sensors, 3) outside the range of accuracy established for the sensors, or 4) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved 
oxygen <28%).  Data are deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor 
malfunction, 2) exposure of sensors during low tides, or 3) fouling of sensors 
by aquatic organisms, debris, or sediment.  Sensor malfunctions are detected if 
the voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the 
sensor or the sensor will not calibrate.  Fouling of sensors is detected by 
comparing in-situ sensor readings with measurements (see Research Methods 
section).  In addition, sensor readings that differ significantly (>10%) from 
standard solution (i.e., conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during 
deployment.  After corrections are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the 
files are exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt) to the CDMO.  Saundra 
Upchurch, Amy Whitaker Dukes, and Amy E. Cook are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
		 
	The ACE Basin water quality-monitoring program began on March 3, 1995 at 
two tributaries off Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks (see Site Location and 
Character section for description of sites).  The water quality deployment sites 
were constructed prior to the first deployment (see Research Methods section).  
Initially, the YSI electronic data loggers, at Big Bay and St. Pierre Creeks, 
were programmed to measure the water temperature, specific conductance, 
dissolved oxygen, water level, and pH at 15-minute intervals (the sampling 
interval was changed to 30 minutes prior to the August 11, 1995 deployment 
period).  Starting April 11, 1996 deployment period, turbidity monitoring was 
added to the program.  In 2002, the SWMP program expanded the spatial coverage 
of the monitoring program to include two additional data logger deployment 
sites.   In October of 2002, water quality data loggers were deployed in Fishing 
Creek and Mosquito Creek.   
	Based on discussions with local Coastal Zone Management (CZM) personnel 
and our knowledge of land use within the Reserve, the South Edisto River 
drainage basin appears well suited for studying contrasting hydrographic 
conditions and land use patterns. One NERR water quality monitoring station has 
been established near Edisto Beach within a tributary of Big Bay Creek.  
Surrounded by residential and commercial development and subject to nonpoint 
source pollution, this station is designated as the "treatment" site.  The 
second NERR water quality monitoring station has been situated near Bailey 
Island, within a tributary of St. Pierre Creek.  Urban development in the 
immediate area of this station has been sparse to date so this station will 
serve as the "control" site.  Similar to the two initial monitoring stations, 
the new sites contrast hydrographic conditions, land use patterns in the ACE.  
The third NERR water quality-monitoring station is located within a tributary of 
Fishing Creek on Jehosse Island, and both the South Edisto and North Edisto 
Rivers influence the creek.  The island is owned and operated by the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service and serves as a wildlife refuge for native and migrating 
birds and many of South Carolina's endangered species.  This station will serve 
as a second "control" site.  The fourth NERR water quality monitoring station is 
situated in Mosquito Creek, a tributary of the Ashepoo River.   Surrounded by 
rural development and agriculture, Mosquito Creek is subject to increased 
nutrient loading and possibly herbicides and pesticides.  This station will 
serve as a second "treatment" site.
	In July 1997, the Reserve staff initiated nutrient studies.  The objective 
of the study is to ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient 
levels near our two data logger sites. Nutrient levels are measured during a 
complete tidal cycle each month, and the samples are analyzed for ammonia, 
nitrite-nitrate, and ortho-phosphate concentrations.  In February of 2002, 
nutrient collection and analysis was established and became apart of the SWMP 
protocol.  Nutrients and Chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly at all four 
deployment sites, and a diel (24-hour sampling) is conducted monthly at St. 
Pierre Creek.    

4.	Research Methods
		Each data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station, 
three in the South Edisto River watershed and one in the Ashepoo watershed.  
Each deployment mount is cleaned and maintained on a monthly basis.  The 
monitoring station at Big Bay Creek was constructed in 1995, and consisted of a 
PVC pipe mounted vertically on a pole. This monitoring station was replaced in 
Oct of 2001 because of its old age, high potential for fouling to the data, and 
growth of oysters on the mount.  The new mount consists of two 5-foot PVC pipes 
mounted vertically on two overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles.  The new mount 
design allows for easy access to the YSI data sondes.  To facilitate water flow 
across the sensors, approximately one-inch diameter holes are drilled into the 
PVC pipes.  The pipes are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are 
approximately 0.5 meters from the creek bottom.  In 1997, the St. Pierre Creek 
station was modified: the PVC pipe is mounted horizontally in a pyramid-shaped 
cage (2.5 ft long x 1.5 ft high) tethered to the original 12-foot galvanized 
pole.  Later that year, we began to put the data loggers in 1/8-inch mesh net 
bags before placing them in the PVC pipe to reduce damage by crabs and fish.  In 
April of 2000, the St. Pierre station was moved and modified.  The station was 
moved to the other side of the creek, and the pyramid-shaped cage was deployed 
vertically at the base of the pole. In September of 2001, the St. Pierre 
deployment mount was replaced with three 5-foot PVC pipes mounted vertically on 
two overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles. To facilitate water flow across the 
sensors, approximately one-inch diameter holes were drilled into the PVC pipes.  
The Fishing Creek monitoring station was constructed in October of 2002, and 
consists of a 5-gallon bucket cut in half and filled with concrete.  PVC pipe is 
attached horizontally, with floats fastened at either end, to the bucket with a 
one-foot lead line through a stainless steal eyebolt set in the concrete.  When 
the data logger is deployed, it floats horizontally approximately 0.5 meters 
from the creek bottom.  In October of 2002, the Mosquito Creek monitoring 
station was constructed using three overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles with 
three 5-foot PVC pipes mounted vertically. To facilitate water flow across the 
sensors, approximately two-inch diameter holes were drilled into the PVC pipes.  
The deployment mount is secured by u-brackets to a bridge for extra support.  
During the summer, the data loggers are left at the sites for one to two weeks, 
and the sampling period is extended up to one month during the cooler months.
	At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are brought back to 
the laboratory for cleaning, post calibration, and servicing, by methods 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  After cleaning the data 
loggers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and is allowed to 
stretch for 24 hours before calibration begins.  The pH, conductivity, depth, 
and turbidity sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 and 
10, conductivity standard of 58.64mS/cm, depth in the air, and turbidity 
standards of 0 and 200 NTU, respectively for the 6026 turbidity probe.  In 
August of 2002, the Reserve upgraded the turbidity probes to the new 6136 probe, 
which is calibrated in standards of 0 and 123 NTU, respectively.  The water 
level sensor is zeroed in air, and the chlorophyll is zeroed in distilled water.  
The DO sensor is calibrated in air-saturated water.  In addition to the 
procedures outlined in the CDMO manual, we conduct a DO membrane integrity test 
prior to deployment to determine if the membrane was damaged during calibration.
	Several quality assurance checks are used to determine if the sensor 
readings drifted significantly during deployment. In-situ measurements of 
dissolved oxygen, expressed in mg/L, salinity, pH, and water temperature are 
taken during deployment and retrieval of the data sondes.  Water samples are 
collected at the same depth as the sensors.  Water temperature, salinity, and pH 
are measured directly with a thermistor, refractometer and pH meter, 
respectively, and dissolved oxygen level is determined by the Winkler titration.  
As of November 2001, second sets of in-situ measurements are recorded using an 
YSI 600 XL data sonde with an YSI 650 Multi-Parameter Display System (MDS).  
	Post-deployment measurements of all the parameters except turbidity are 
taken before cleaning the data loggers.  Turbidity is post calibrated after the 
sonde has been cleaned to insure the accuracy of the standard.  Sensors are 
immersed in the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., pH) and readings are 
recorded. A DO membrane integrity test also is conducted to determine if the 
membrane was damaged during deployment.  The results of these checks are used to 
evaluate the validity of the data (see Post Deployment Information section). 

5. Site Locations and Character:
ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve is one of the largest undeveloped 
estuaries on the East Coast. The study area encompasses the Ashepoo, Combahee 
and South Edisto River basins, which empty into St. Helena Sound.  The NERR 
consists of approximately 150,000 acres of diverse estuarine wetlands providing 
preserved habitats for fish and wildlife 
		Three sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South Edisto 
River and one is in a tributary of the Ashepoo River.  Each site averages a year 
round tidal range of approximately 2.0 m (6.5 feet), with a maximum of 2.48 m 
(8.2 feet) and a minimum of 1.45 m (4.8 feet).  The descriptions of the sites 
are as follows: 
Station A, Big Bay Creek - GPS coordinates: 32.4897N and -80.3202W 
This site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek. Surrounded by residential 
and commercial development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this 
station is designated as a "treatment" site. Pollution sources include houses 
bordering the creek, many of them with little setbacks from the bordering 
Spartina marsh; forty docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and 
Wolmanized pilings; boat dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a 
paved road and three boat ramps off the creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA 
treated bulkheads and fueling areas located about 0.5 miles downstream; two 
commercial seafood docks with 8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three 
restaurants. The creek is closed to shellfish harvesting because of the human 
development in the vicinity. Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh 
dominated by Spartina alterniflora with isolated areas of Salicornia. Upland 
fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oak and cedars. Reefs of American 
oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fringe the creek banks.  In 2002, the yearly 
average creek depth at a late ebb tide was 1.06 m (3.5 feet) and salinity was 
32.3 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station B, St. Pierre Creek - GPS coordinates: 32.5233N and -80.3568W 
This site is in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek. It is surrounded by a wide 
expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh. Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs 
fringe the banks.  Maritime forest communities comprised of species such as wax 
myrtles, live oaks, and palmettos dominate the upland areas.  This station is 
designated as a "control" site, because development in the immediate area is 
sparse, and the creek is subject to relatively light boat traffic.  In 2002, the 
yearly average creek depth at a late ebb tide was 2.0 m (6.6 feet) and salinity 
was 30.7 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station C, Fishing Creek - GPS coordinates: 32.6358 N and -80.3655W 
This site is in a tidal creek off Fishing Creek. Located within the boundaries 
of Jehosse Island, a protected Wildlife Management Area, this site is surrounded 
by extensive Spartina cynosuroides marsh and vast mud flats.  The upland areas 
of Jehosse Island consist of long leaf pines, live oaks, and contain managed 
drainage impoundments.  Once considered working rice fields, these impoundments 
are well-managed wetlands filled with thriving brackish marshes and not subject 
to pesticides and herbicides.  Relatively subject to light boat traffic (i.e. 
commercial crab harvesters) and sparse development, this station is designated 
as a "control" site.  In 2002, the yearly average creek depth at a late ebb tide 
was 1.2 m (3.8 feet) and salinity was 10.6 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station D, Mosquito Creek - GPS coordinates: 32.5558 N and -80.4380W 
This site is in the tidal creek of Mosquito Creek. Surrounded by intermediate 
rural, residential and agricultural development, and subject to nonpoint source 
pollution, this station is designated as a "treatment" site. Several impoundment 
trunks open and drain into the creek increasing the nutrient load and possibly 
introducing herbicides and pesticides.  Other pollution sources include several 
houses bordering the creek, ten docks constructed of creosote, concrete and 
Wolmanized pilings; medium boat traffic through the creek; one boat ramps off 
the creek; a commercial seafood and fueling area is located about 0.5 miles 
downstream, with three commercial shrimp boats. Vegetation in the area includes 
salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus.  Upland 
fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oaks and pine trees.  In 2002, 
the yearly average creek depth at a late ebb tide was 4.8 m (15.7 feet) and 
salinity was 19.5 parts per thousand (ppt).
   	Fishing Creek and Mosquito Creek data collection began in October of 2002, 
and with the limited data collected, accurate discussions of trends in water 
quality at these monitoring stations are not feasible.  

	The following discussions of trends in water quality at Big Bay and St. 
Pierre monitoring stations are based on data collected from March 1995 through 
December 1997.  During this period, water temperature at both monitoring sites 
exhibited a seasonal pattern with lowest values occurring in December-January.  
The lowest monthly water temperature observed was 8.9 oC, which occurred in 
February 1996 at St. Pierre Creek; whereas maximum temperatures occurred in July 
and August with the highest monthly water temperature 38.9 oC occurring in July 
1995 at Big Bay Creek.  Diurnal variation in temperature was evident with 
warmest temperatures occurring from 1300 hr to 1800 hr at both sites.  Salinity 
also exhibited seasonal variability during the same period, with lowest values 
occurring in March at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks.  Another period of low 
average monthly salinity occurred at Big Bay Creek in December 1997.  Average 
annual salinity for both sites was in the polyhaline regime, with a mean of 29.4 
‰ at Big Bay Creek and 26.3‰ at St. Pierre Creek; however, for all years, 
salinity ranged from 0.3-41.7 ‰ at Big Bay and from 0-41.7‰ at St. Pierre Creek.  
Local precipitation and evaporation conditions are most likely the major 
contributors to monthly variability in salinity.  Analysis of the data indicates 
that tidal stage strongly influences salinity.  As expected, highest values of 
salinity occurred on the flood tide. 
	It appears that tidal stage also influences pH. Spectral analysis revealed 
a periodicity for pH and water depth with a sinusoidal period at ~ 12 hrs., 
representing tidal periodicity.  Time series plots of pH indicated variability 
of ~1 standard unit (su) on a daily basis. The pH at both sites was very 
similar, ranging from 5.3-8.4; however, the preponderance of measurements were 
>7 at both sites.  The pH observed at the two monitoring sites appears to be 
attributable to natural conditions. Marked variations in pH can also occur 
diurnally due to changes in primary production and respiration.
	Dissolved oxygen concentrations appeared to track depth for part of the 
cycle, with lowest values occurring on low tides.  Afternoon and evening values 
were not as low as early morning values, suggesting a diurnal component.  
Dissolved oxygen values at the two monitoring sites were generally high 
throughout the year with averages of 83.6% saturation and 6.6 mg/l for Big Bay 
Creek and 78.5% saturation and 6.3 mg/l for St. Pierre Creek, with highest 
values in winter and lowest in summer.  Hypoxic events (<28% air saturation) 
were observed in every season, but summer was clearly the season with the 
greatest percent of time when DO was < 28%. Whereas, supersaturation (>100% air 
saturation) occurred primarily in the winter, with values exceeding 120% at both 
creeks. There are a few differences among the sites such as, hypoxic conditions 
occur more frequently at St. Pierre Creek.
	Unlike the other parameters monitored at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks, 
there appears to be no distinct seasonal trend in turbidity; however, monthly 
variability appeared greater at the St. Pierre site. This may be due to 
fluctuations in the amount of detritus being washed form the extensive salt 
marsh and upland sites that surround St. Pierre Creek.
	It appears that metal leachates from the pilings, even the new ones, in 
reasonably tidal flushed areas, along Big Bay Creek have negligible ecological 
effects, according to the 1994 study by Weis and Weis.  Their findings indicated 
that concentrations of the metals (Cr, Cu, and As) in sediments adjacent to 
pilings along Big Bay Creek were generally not significantly elevated, and there 
were no consistent differences in the benthic communities between the Big Bay 
and St. Pierre monitoring sites.
	However, the highest values of PAHs encountered (299.0 ng/g) during a 
study by Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews from 1993-1995 were in the South 
Edisto watershed at Big Bay Creek; this station also had detectable levels of 
PCBs, concentrations as well.  Whereas, the concentrations in St. Pierre Creek 
were below the level of detection for persistent pesticides and for PCBs.  At 
most 34 sites, contaminant levels were below the level of detection for 
persistent pesticides and for PCBs, suggesting that the ACE is a relatively 
pristine system.

8. 	Associated researchers and projects:
Dr. Charles Wenner of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute received funding 
through the National Marine Fisheries Service in January of 2001 to continue an 
ongoing survey of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in the South Edisto and 
Combahee River basins, by electro-fishing in tidal freshwater and low salinity 
brackish water.  Although red drum are the target species, all catches are 
separated, measured and weighted to provide a distribution and population size 
for each species.    
The ACE Basin NERR received initial funding from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency to establish a National Atmospheric Deposition Program site in 
the Reserve. Sampling efforts began on January 1, 2002 and will continue for 
five years. Weekly precipitation samples are collected and analyzed for 
atmospheric pollutants.  The precipitation collector is located on Bear Island, 
a Wildlife Management Area inside the NERR.
In March of 2002, the Reserve participated in a beta test of the new YSI 6600 
EDS - Extended Deployment System data sonde.  The ACE Basin was one of five 
estuarine sites, selected by Mike Lizotte at ENDECO/YSI to collect water quality 
data using the new data sonde.  The new data sonde is outfitted with a synthetic 
squirrel-hair wiper that is attached to the turbidity wiper, which swipes the DO 
membrane and the pH sensor to clear them of any debris or bio-foul.  The data 
sonde was deployed beside an existing 6000 data sonde in St. Pierre Creek from 
March 15, 2002 to April 15, 2002.  The data sets were compared by YSI, and the 
6600 EDS proved to extend the accuracy and longevity of DO measurements for up 
to 60 days with minimal drift.  The results from this beta test convinced 
Reserve staff to upgrade all YSI data sondes to the new 6600 EDS, which included 
the new 6136 turbidity probe.  The new data sondes were deployed in August of 
2002.  
	The ACE Basin participated in the NOAA funded, NERR Invasive Decapod Pilot 
project.     Sampling efforts began in August of 2002, and will continue through 
June of 2003.  Utilizing the established NERR systems, four northwestern NERR 
sites and five southeastern NERR sites were selected to participate in the pilot 
project.  The project was designed to understand which crabs have invaded which 
sites.  Identical crab collectors are deployed at the participating Reserves, 
and all crabs found in collectors are identified, measured, and counted.  The 
sex and general condition of crabs (reproductive status, molt stage, obvious 
parasites, etc.) are noted as well.  
	Dr. Clark Alexander of Skidaway Institute and ACE Basin Reserve staff 
conducted a spatial distribution of salinity, at high slack water, in each of 
the rivers of the ACE Basin in September of 2002.  This study was initiated 
after severe drought conditions impacted the NERR during the summer of 2002.  A 
second sample will be conducted in April of 2003.  
	The results of addition studies conducted in the ACE Basin can be obtained 
by contacting the Reserve.

		01/22/02	16:30:00-17:00:00
c)	During the following periods, the salinity readings are suspect 
because values were less than 18ppt.  These readings are not within normal 
polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 and 40 ppt) for this site.  The low 
readings were possibly due to an extremely low tide and a rainfall event.  
Temperature readings were low, supporting the hypothesis that values were due to 
rain.
		01/13/02	02:30:00-03:30:00
d) During the following periods of the January 22 - February 5 deployment.  The 
pH readings are suspect because the probe failed during the end of deployment, 
indicated by a downward drift in readings.  
		1/22/02	12:30:00		THRU			01/31/02	10:30:00
e) During the following periods of the January 22 - February 5 deployment, the 
pH readings were deleted. The pH probe failed during the end of deployment.  
Indicated by a downward drift in readings.  The sensor did not read within the 
required range during the post-deployment calibration check on pH 10.

	St. Pierre
a)	During the following periods, data were deleted because the 
datalogger went dry.
		11/06/02	14:30:00-16:00:00
		11/30/02	22:30:00-23:30:00
b)	During the following periods, the salinity readings are suspect because 
values were less than 18ppt.  These readings are not within normal 
polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 and 40 ppt) for this site.  The low 
readings were possibly due to low tides and rainfall events.
		11/13/02	09:00:00
		11/16/02	22:00:00-23:00:00
c)	During the following periods, the depth readings are negative and/or zero.  
The depth data were not deleted because the salinity and dissolved oxygen 
readings indicate the data logger was submerged during these periods.

		11/30/02	10:00:00-11:00:00;  21:30:00-22:00:00
d)	During the following periods of the November 4 to December 12 
deployment, the pH readings were suspect.  The pH sensor failed during the 
deployment.		
		11/04/02	10:30:00		THRU		11/17/02	21:00:00
e)	During the following periods of the November 4 to December 12 
deployment, the pH readings were deleted.  The pH sensor failed during the 
deployment.  The sensor did not read within the required range during the post-
deployment calibration check on pH 10.
		11/17/02	21:30:00			THRU			11/30/02
	23:30:00
f)	During the following periods, the turbidity spiked ranging from 1006 NTU 
to 1590 NTU.  The high spikes were possibly caused by an animal, a clump of 
plant matter, or sediment that passed by the sensor optics during the sampling 
interval.  Furthermore, extremely low tides with heavy rainfall events may have 
contributed to the turbidity spiking.
		11/03/02	11:30:00-14:30:00;  19:30:00
g)	During the October 8 to November 4 deployment, the turbidity readings were suspect.  The recorded values consistently increased throughout the deployment.  The post-deployment calibration check for the 123 NTU was low (105.7 NTU).  The probe was sent to Mike Lizotte at YSI, and the problem was corrected. 
			 

	Fishing Creek
a)	During the following periods, dissolved oxygen (DO) readings are 
suspect because readings dip below 28% air saturation.
		11/30/02	23:30:00
b)	During the following periods of the November 15 - December 16 deployment, salinity and specific conductivity were deleted.  The data sonde was deployed vertically in the water column causing air to be trapped within the cavity of the probe.  Therefore, the probe did not record salinity and specific conductivity values during the beginning of the deployment.  The probe recovered and passed the post-calibration check.
11/15/02    12:00:00           THRU                11/20/02    08:00:00

c)	At 07:00:00 on November 30, the turbidity spiked (1134 NTU).  The 
high spike was possibly caused by an animal, a clump of plant matter, or 
sediment that passed by the sensor optics during the sampling interval.
		
	Mosquito Creek
a)	At 00:30:00 on November 6, no data were recorded by the datalogger.  
The reason for the missing reading is not known at this time. 
b)	During the following periods, the turbidity readings are suspect.  
Turbidity consistently spiked at the end of the deployment.  A large bloom in 
alga growth was present at the retrieval of the datalogger.  The alga growth 
likely influenced the turbidity readings.

		12/30/02	23:00:00-23:30:00
b)	During the following periods, the salinity and specific conductivity 
readings were deleted.  The low readings were possibly due to minimal flow of 
water through the electrodes.

	St. Pierre
a) During the following periods of the December 12 to January 14 deployment, the 
dissolved oxygen (DO) and DO mg/L readings were deleted because the membrane was 
punctured. The probe failed the post-calibration DO membrane integrity test.  
The last DO reading from the previous deployment was 76.6%; the first DO reading 
of this deployment was 120.7%, indicating that the DO membrane was punctured 
prior to deployment. 
		12/12/02 	10:00:00		THRU			12/31/02	23:30:00
b)	During the following periods, the salinity readings are suspect because 
values were less than 18ppt.  These readings are not within normal 
polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 and 40 ppt) for this site.  The low 
readings were possibly due to an extremely low tide.	
		12/03/02	00:30:00
c)	During the following periods, the depth readings are negative and/or 
zeero.  The depth data were not deleted because the salinity and dissolved 
oxygen readings indicate the data logger was submerged during these periods.

d)	During the following periods of the November 4 to December 12 
deployment, the pH readings were deleted.  The pH sensor failed during the 
deployment.  The sensor did not read within the required range during the post-
deployment calibration check on pH 10.

Fishing Creek
a)	During the following periods, the turbidity spiked ranging from 1112 
NTU to 1893 NTU.  The high spike was possibly caused by an animal, a clump of 
plant matter, or sediment that passed by the sensor optics during the sampling 
interval.  Furthermore, a low tide and/or a rainfall event may have contributed 
to the turbidity spiking.

14. Other Remarks
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Blanket Statements: 
a) DO less than 28% air saturation (hypoxia) is frequently observed in the ACE 
Basin NERR during the warmer months, especially April to September, however 
hypoxia was also observed in October in both Big Bay and St. Pierre Creek.  
Hypoxia events are common in the salt march environment and occurred 
consistently during late ebb, low slack, and early flood tides.  Natural factors 
can contribute to these low DO measurements including insufficient water 
circulation, elevated water temperature, and the lack of stratification in 
shallow estuarine habitats.  
b) DO greater than 120% air saturation (supersaturation) is frequently observed 
in the ACE Basin NERR during the colder months, especially January to March.  
Supersaturation events are not uncommon in shallow estuarine waters and usually 
occur during late daylight hours as water temperature rises, thus elevating 
primary productivity.  The supersaturation event in August corresponded with the 
highest water levels, suggesting an environmental cause.
c) DO measurements between 100% and 120% air saturation are not listed in the 
metadata.  These DO readings consistently occur in the ACE Basin NERR and are 
not considered to be suspect.

Salinity (parts per thousand) Blanket Statement: Salinity readings recorded 
within the normal polyhaline/euhaline salinity range (18 and 40 ppt) at both St. 
Pierre and Big Bay creeks are not considered anomalous data.  Salinity readings 
are highly influenced by rainfall and low tide events that could result in lower 
than normal salinity readings.  

pH Blanket Statement: During consecutive deployments from January to June in 
2002, recorded pH readings varied at St Pierre Creek between two alternating 
probes.  Although each probe calibrated and post-calibrated within range, the 
values recorded indicated a difference in the pH range between deployments.   
The data were not deleted.   

Depth (meters) Blanket Statement: Negative depth readings were recorded in both 
St. Pierre and Big Bay Creeks.  The data were not deleted because the salinity 
and dissolved oxygen readings indicated the data logger was submerged during 
these periods. The depth sensor on an YSI data sonde is calibrated inside a 
laboratory using a barometric pressure of 760 millabars.  Changes in barometric 
pressure while the data sonde is deployed often result in negative depth values, 
especially at low tides.
 
Turbidity (NTU) Blanket Statement: In January of 2002, Mike Lizotte, a 
representative for YSI, brought to the attention of CDMO and NERR staff, that 
turbidity standards used in calibration not purchased directly from YSI may be 
producing less than accurate data.  The Advanced Polymer Systems Incorporated 
(APS) turbidity standard used by the ACE Basin NERR for calibration during 2002 
deployments is not compatible with YSI turbidity probes.  During the fall of 
2002, Mike Lizotte, compared the APS turbidity standard, used by the Reserve, 
against the YSI turbidity standard.  A newly calibrated YSI turbidity probe was 
placed in each standard, the values recorded, and the variance between standards 
was calculated to be an approximate five to seven percent difference in NTU
