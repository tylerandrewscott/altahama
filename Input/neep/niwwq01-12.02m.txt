2.  Entry verification
The .dat and .csv versions of the raw data files were uploaded to a PC from YSI 
6000 or 6600 dataloggers. Raw data were uploaded and plotted using EcoWatch 
software. CDMO macros were also used in EXCEL 5.0 to identify anomalous or 
problem data in the files.  The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro allows the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro 
will allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel 
file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In 
addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro 
allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis. 

Comma delimited files are opened in Microsoft EXCEL 5.0 and edited by removing 
unnecessary headers, footers or spaces and any data which corresponds to the 
instrument being out of the water for maintenance.  Next, data plots were 
produced and examined for any anomalies using the CDMO graphing Macro for each 
variable. Suspect data were evaluated as to being either good or bad based on 
criteria outlined in the CDMO manual version 4.0.  If the data were determined 
to be bad, they were deleted from the final edited .txt file and then documented 
in the metadata.  If it could not be determined whether or not suspect data were 
bad (as was often the case with turbidity) the data were left in the final 
edited .txt file and noted in the metadata as anomalous. The dissolved oxygen 
(DO) and Turbidity (Turb) probes were the most problematic.  In instances where 
data values increased or decreased in an exponential fashion and or 
intermittently went outside the accepted range for that instrument and never 
returned to normal, the data were considered suspect, noted in the metadata, and 
removed from the final edited data file.  Missing data due to equipment failure 
or maintenance were replaced with periods (.). The date/hour and column reformat 
macros were then run on the data files before being saved in their final edited 
form (.txt).  Edited (.txt) and raw (.csv) files were then FTP'd to both the Sun 
Sparc II and the CDMO server and archived. The most current CDMO macros are 
available on the NERRS CDMO home page.  Tracy Buck, and Jennifer Keesee edited 
and archived the 2002 data for Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, Oyster Landing, and 
Clambank Creek. 

3.  Research Objectives
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for North Inlet/Winyah Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality over time.  Four sites were chosen; two to represent our pristine 
site and the other two to represent impacted sites.  The Oyster Landing site is 
located near the center of the Reserve and is considered pristine.  Debidue 
Creek and Thousand Acre are both located in waterways that receive run-off from 
heavily developed areas.  The Clambank site is located on a waterway that 
receives run-off from the undeveloped area of the reserve and is considered a 
pristine site. Measurements were taken every 30 minutes over roughly two week 
collecting periods at the Oyster Landing, Debidue Creek, Clambank and Thousand 
Acre sites. 

4.  Research methods (YSI 6000 dataloggers)
YSI dataloggers are currently mounted in a 4" diameter PVC pipe which is 
strapped to a treated 2" X 6" board; and then attached via stainless steel bands 
to a piling at the Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, Clambank, and Oyster Landing 
sites.  The PVC pipe that houses the data loggers has two large windows cut out 
near the bottom for the probes to have direct contact with the water column.  A 
stop bolt placed through the PVC pipe below the cut out windows keeps the 
datalogger exactly one foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  Every 30 minutes 
measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, water temperature, pH, turbidity, and water level are recorded.  The 
two-week sampling interval has been selected due to biofouling of the individual 
probes and expected battery life.  At the end of each sampling interval, the 
dataloggers were brought back to the laboratory to be downloaded, cleaned and 
recalibrated following procedures in YSI Service Manual and the Standard 
Operating Procedures V3.0 provided by NERR SWMP.  Downtime for this maintenance 
is roughly 24 hrs. Before the instruments were cleaned and recalibrated a post 
calibration reading was taken from each instrument in fresh standard to see if 
any of the instruments exhibited drift (see II-13).  The pH probe was calibrated 
using a two point method with 7,10 standards.  The turbidity probe calibration 
also used a two-point method using 0 & 100 NTU standards.  Specific 
Conductivity was calibrated using a one-point method and a 10 ms/cm standard 
that was purchased through YSI, Inc.  The turbidity wiper and DO membrane were 
changed after each deployment.  After approximately 24 hours of down time for 
cleaning and overnight relaxing of the DO membrane, the YSI dataloggers were re-
deployed (in some instances the sondes are switched out resulting in less data 
loss).

5.  Site location and character
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in two tidal estuaries, North 
Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, 
located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type 
estuary (Pritchard, 1955).  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous 
winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal 
anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine 
forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The 
Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955), 
which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the 
largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km 
south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which 
are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain 
approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  Descriptions of the four 
sampling stations are as follows:

A) Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:17:57; long. 79:15:36) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek and is on the NW 
corner of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh (this site was relocated 07-19-
99 to the current location due to heavy siltation and degrading data quality).  
The present site is about 15m from the mouth of the creek.  At the sampling 
site, creek depth is approximately 2 m MHW and creek width is approximately 10 
m.  The creek empties into the northeastern side of the mid portion of Winyah 
Bay and directly drains pine forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 
0 to 15 ppt. and tidal flux is approximately 1m.  The bottom is mostly composed 
of fine sediments and detritus.  Georgetown, 5 km upstream from the Thousand 
Acre site and on the southern side of Winyah Bay, is the homeport for a number 
of heavy industries including a steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a 
coal fired power plant.  A public sewage treatment plant, which discharges into 
the bay, is also located in Georgetown.

B) Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat.  33:20:58; long.  79:11:34). The Oyster Landing 
monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area located at 
the end of the Oyster Landing pier which is also where the NI-WB Bay NERR 
weather station site is located.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of 
Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of North Inlet.  The sampling site is 
located approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of Crabhaul Creek.  The creek 
directly drains pine-forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0-
32 ppt. and average tidal flux is approximately 1.44m.  The creek has an average 
depth of ~2 m MHW and average width of ~150m MHW.  The bottom mostly is 
comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus.

C) Debidue Creek (DC) - (lat 33:21:37, long 79:10:05). The Debidue Creek 
monitoring site is considered an impacted site that is located approximately 1 
km south of the Debidue Colony.  The Colony is a large development built on man-
made canals that directly drain into the northern portion of Debidue Creek.  The 
DC site is also located in an ocean-dominated Spartina marsh that was formerly 
surrounded by pine-dominated uplands.  Salinity can range from 0 to full 
strength seawater and an average tidal flux of approximately 2 meters.  The 
approximate depth and width at MHW at the site is 2.2 and 70 m respectively.  
The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and 
detritus.

D) Clambank Creek (CB) - (lat 33:20:02, long 79:11:34).  The Clambank Creek 
monitoring site is located roughly in the center of the reserve property.  This 
site is surrounded by a Spartina marsh and drains associated uplands.  Salinity 
ranged from 0.4 to full strength seawater (from August through December 2001).  
The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash and some fine sediment.  
This site is considered a pristine site and is influenced by its close proximity 
to North Inlet.  

6.  Data collection period
Thousand Acre data collection began January 1, 1995.  Debidue Creek sampling 
began March 5, 1998. Oyster Landing data collection began in 1995; however, it 
was not considered a SWMP site until 1996 when the collection site was switched 
from Caledonia to Oyster Landing. Clambank sampling began in February 1981 
through June 1995; however, it was not considered a SWMP site until sampling 
resumed in August of 2001 (08/17).  All sampling is ongoing.

its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons.  The Federal 
government does not assume liability to the Recipient of third persons, nor will 
the Federal government reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for its liability 
due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the general 
information link on CDMO homepage) and online at the CDMO homepage  
http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/.  Data are available in text tab-
delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format.

8.  Associated researchers and projects
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core-monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  Thousand Acre is our permanent monitoring station 
for the NERR monitoring program, but Oyster Landing and Debidue Creek were also 
sampled beginning in 1998. These stations are also included in our NIW core-
monitoring program.

A long-term fish survey is also done at the Oyster Landing site bi-weekly.  
Species present, total weight, individual weights and standard lengths of fish 
that utilize the marsh at low tide are recorded.  In the spring, summer, and 
fall months, fish utilizing the marsh at high tide are also sampled.

The NERR weather station is also located at the Oyster Landing site.  Air 
temperature and humidity, barometric pressure, solar radiation (total and PAR), 
wind speed and direction, and precipitation are measured.

Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.

a). For the following dates and times all data were deleted, as readings were 
consistent with the probes being out of the water (i.e. negative depth values 
and inconsistent salinity/Sp. Cond. values):

b).  For the following dates and times the datalogger recorded negative depth 
data. However, specific conductivity and salinity sensor readings suggest that 
the datalogger was not out of the water, so suspect that negative values 
indicate shallow depth and are simply due to a slight calibration error.  Data 
were retained.

b).  For the following dates and times, turbidity data spiked above 1000 NTU.  
During this period, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity and conductivity data dropped 
and were very noisy.  There was no known weather event to explain these values.  
Battery power dropped steadily over the deployment until the sonde quit logging 
data on 03/17/02 at 20:00 EST.  The sonde was heavily fouled with wrack upon 
retrieval.  YSI engineer (Mike Lizotte) suggests that these readings are not 
typical of low battery power, but rather a severe fouling event preventing 
adequate flow through the mesh bag and probe guard.  For this reason, turbidity 
data (and all other parameters) were retained, but should be considered suspect.

b).  For the following dates and times, turbidity spiked above 1000 NTU.  It was 
found on retrieval that the turbidity wiper was parked partially over the 
optics, possibly due to excessive fouling by mud and wrack. It is unknown how 
long during the deployment the wiper malfunctioned, therefore, all turbidity 
data during the period of 1000+ NTU were considered suspect and deleted.

deleted.

06/28/02 11:00:00 through 06/30/02 23:30:00

b). As noted above (a.), the sonde was improperly deployed during the June 28 
11:00:00 through July 12 09:30 deployment so the sonde was not recording at the 
standard depth of 1 foot above the creek bottom. There were no recorded "out of 
water" events in July during this deployment however, so all other parameters 
remaining for this deployment were retained but should be considered suspect as 
it was recorded at a non-standard depth for this site.

c).  For the following dates and times, salinity data were affected by heavy 
fouling.  It was noted upon retrieval that the conductivity probe was completely 
occluded by sea-squirts.  Data were deleted from the point where no tidal signal

c).  For the following dates and times, dissolved oxygen (% and mg/l) data 
dropped to a low and did not show typical signs of tidal fluctuation.  This is 
most likely due to a fouling event during this period that prevented proper 
water flow over the probes.  There was evidence of a hypoxic event during the 
deployment due to heavy sulfide staining on the sonde and chum bag at retrieval.  
Data were retained, but should be considered suspect.

12. Missing Data 

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks:

01/29/02	Began wrapping bottom of sonde in a wet, white towel upon and 
transporting in a bucket with small amount of water upon retrieval, during post 
calibration of dissolved oxygen, and prior to deployment.  Previous protocol 
involved using YSI-supplied calibration cup.

02/28/02	Began using new YSI-approved turbidity standard to calibrate all 
instruments.

03/04/02	Changed dissolved oxygen probe warm-up period to 60 seconds.

DEBIDUE CREEK

1/17/02 	The dissolved oxygen probe on alternate Debidue Creek sonde (Unit A) 
was removed to replace the faulty dissolved oxygen probe on Clambank sonde (Unit 
B).

01/23/02 22:00:00 through 01/29/02 13:30:00 Files were adjusted as the time 
stamp was off by 29 seconds.

1/31/02 	A new dissolved oxygen probe was installed on alternate Debidue 
Creek sonde (Unit A).

3/26/02 	The conductivity probe was replaced on alternate Debidue Creek sonde 
(Unit A) due to probe malfunction.

4/17/02 	The Debidue Creek sonde was not pushed down all the way to the 
bottom of the sonde tube when deployed at 10:25 EST.  The sonde was pushed down 
to the stop bolt at 12:00 EST on 4/17/02.  Depth data could have been affected 
during this period.

5/06/02 	The turbidity probe was replaced on the Debidue Creek sonde (Unit J) 
with a new (model 6136) turbidity probe.

5/15/02 	The turbidity probe was replaced on the alternate Debidue Creek 
sonde (Unit A) with a new (model 6136) turbidity probe. Sonde software was 
updated at this time.

5/25/02 	The PVC sonde tube was replaced at Debidue Creek. Heavy fouling may 
have affected some data prior to this date.

6/24/02  Corrected 0515dc-j.dat raw file due to erroneous entry of 5/14/02 
14:44:22.

6/28/02 11:00:00 through 6/30/02 23:30:00 The sonde did not settle to the bottom 
of the PVC tube during deployment which gave inaccurate depth data during the 
deployment.  No other data were affected, so only depth data were deleted.

08/16/02	Due to a suspected problem with the APS turbidity standard, I was 
unable to calibrate the turbidity on Unit A for this deployment (08/16/02 
through 08/29/02). 

08/01/02  	Depth data for 08/01/02 were incorrect due to the sonde being 
improperly deployed in the sonde tube.  This was corrected at 12:45:00 08/01/02, 
so all depth data after that period are correct.

08/02  For the month of August, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Debidue Creek.


11/02 There was an obvious difference in pH readings between deployments of Unit 
G (11/01-11/19) and Unit T (11/19-11/30).  pH MV readings were close to out-of-
range during calibration before the 11/01 deployment.  This may account for the 
higher readings by that sensor as compared to those of Unit T.

11/02  For the month of November, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Debidue Creek.

12/02 For the month of December, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Debidue Creek.  

OYSTER LANDING

5/20/02 	The PVC sonde tube was replaced at Oyster Landing.  Heavy fouling 
may have affected some data prior to this date.

5/04/02	Effects of a rain event on this day were evident in salinity, 
conductivity and water temperature data.

5/18/02	Effects of a rain event on this day were evident in salinity, 
conductivity, water temperature and possibly dissolved oxygen (% and mg/l) data.

07/31/02 08:00:00 File was adjusted as the time stamp was off by 4 minutes 47 
seconds.  

07/10/02 through 07/31/02 The circuit board failed in the sonde and all data 
were lost during this deployment.

07/31/02	Due to the malfunction of the Unit G, the new Extended Deployment 
Sonde (Unit T) (6136 turbidity probe) was deployed at Oyster Landing from 
07/31/02 through 08/15/02.

08/16/02	Due to a calibration error with the EDS sonde (Unit T), Unit J (with 
6136 turbidity probe) was deployed at Oyster Landing from 08/16/02 through 
08/28/02.

08/02 For the month of August, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Oyster Landing.

08/16/02  Due to a suspected problem with the APS turbidity standard, I was 
unable to calibrate the turbidity on Unit J for this deployment (08/16/02 
through 08/28/02). 

09/02 For the month of September, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Oyster Landing.  

10/02 An internal software problem (Unit T) caused the conductivity probe to 
fail during the October deployment.  Unit G was deployed in Unit T's place while 
Unit T was sent in for repair.

12/02 For the month of December, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Oyster Landing.  

THOUSAND ACRE

01/01/02 00:00:00 through 01/02/02 09:30:00 Files were adjusted as the time 
stamp was off by 57 seconds.

01/03/02 11:30:00 through 01/16/02 11:00:00 Files were adjusted as the time 
stamp was off by 14 minutes 12 seconds.

01/31/02 10:00:00 through 02/13/02 10:00:00 Files were adjusted as the time 
stamp was off by 2 minutes 5 seconds.

5/01/02 	The conductivity/dissolved oxygen probe was replaced on the Thousand 
Acre sonde (Unit H) due to a probe malfunction.

05/15/02 - 05/29/02 No cloth chum bag was placed over the Thousand Acre sonde 
guard.  Turbidity readings could have been affected during this period.

07/01/02 - During calibration, the conductivity readings jumped back and forth 
between 9.1 and 4.5 in a 10 siemens standard.  The instrument was "un-
calibrated" but the reading still fluctuated between these two values during 
calibration.  Calibration was accepted without an error message and set 
calibration to 10.  There would appear to be no adverse effect on 
salinity/conductivity data during the deployment.

08/13/02	Beginning at this deployment, the Thousand Acre sonde was been moved 
approximately 6 feet from its prior location.  The new location is farther out 
in the middle of the creek (attached to the wooden bridge).  This location was 
chosen to try to get better flow over the sonde probes and prevent excessive 
silt/mud deposition that was occurring at the old location.  Two sondes were run 
in tandem (old and new location) prior to changing sites, and it was found that 
there was no discernible difference in water quality measurements between sites 
except for depth.  The new site is approximately 3 foot deeper than the old 
site.

08/18/02 - 08/23/02  It is suspected that a fouling event during this period 
prevented proper movement of water over the probes during sampling which might 
have had effects on the data.  All data should be considered suspect during this 
period.

08/02 For the month of August, rain effects were obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Thousand Acre Marsh.

08/27/02  Due to a suspected problem with the APS turbidity standard, I was 
unable to calibrate the turbidity on Unit H for this deployment (08/27/02 
through 09/09/02).

11/02 For the month of November, rain effects were obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Thousand Acre Marsh.


CLAMBANK CREEK

1/16/02 	The turbidity probe was replaced on the Clambank sonde (Unit B) due 
to a probe malfunction.

4/18/02 	The turbidity probe was replaced on the Clambank sonde (Unit B) due 
to a probe malfunction.

5/23/02	The PVC sonde tube was replaced at Clambank Creek.  Heavy fouling 
may have affected some data prior to this date.

5/15/02 - 5/28/02 No cloth chum bag was placed over the Clambank Creek sonde 
guard.  Turbidity readings could have been affected during this period.

07/02	  During the month of July, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

08/02	  During the month of August, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

08/27/02  Due to a suspected problem with the APS turbidity standard, I was 
unable to calibrate the turbidity on Unit B for this deployment (08/27/02 
through 09/09/02).   

09/02 For the month of September, rain effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

11/02 For the month of November, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

12/02 For the month of December, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data at Clambank Creek.
