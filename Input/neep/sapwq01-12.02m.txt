2. Entry Verification:

	The data are reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowin included with 
the YSI 6000/6600 data logger.  After the file is uploaded from the Data logger, 
Ecowin is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical analyses (i.e., 
min., max., mean, std. dev.) The information obtained from this is used during 
file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the data logger 
was removed from the water or those caused by instrument failure.  The data are 
imported into a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's 
cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of data has been recorded the file 
is ready for review.  The data review includes several steps.  The first step is 
to format the data using the Excel macros provided by CDMO. The CDMO macros will 
allow the user to automatically format column widths to the correct number of 
decimal places based on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to 
QA/QC each data logger generated file for missing data points, fill all cells 
that do not contain data with periods, and find all data points that fall 
outside the range of what the data logger is designed to measure (i.e. 
outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users with 30-minute data to 
automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert 
periods for missing data.  In addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability 
was added to this macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing 
data point graphs on a monthly basis.  Secondly, the Excel macro is used to 
determine if there are any dates and times that data was not recorded due to 
maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  Missing dates and times are 
inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where data would 
normally be.  The reason for the missing data is recorded in this metadata 
document. 

	Data that was outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site 
is investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC 
checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  If the data is/are 
rejected from the file a period is inserted to the cell(s) and an explanation 
for the missing dates and times are recorded in the metadata document. The 
completed Metadata form is then submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Jane 
Garbisch was responsible for all 2001 data collection and management.  

3. Research Objectives:
Hydrological studies (Ragotskie and Bryson, 1955: Imberger et al., 1983) have 
shown that there are three tidal excursions along the length of the Duplin 
River, resulting in three distinct water masses.  The two monitoring sites in 
the Duplin River, called the Lower Duplin site and the Hunt Camp site, are 
located within the lower and upper water masses, respectively.  Water 
passing the Lower Duplin site during flood tide has come from Doboy Sound, which 
receives input from the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway and from 
the Atlantic Ocean.  The water in the lower water mass is pushed further up the 
Duplin or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh surface by 
the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb tide.  The water in 
the upper water mass, which passes the Hunt Camp station, is pushed up small 
creek channels and onto the marsh at each high tide.  Thus the two stations 
monitor conditions in two hydrological separate water masses, one of which is 
heavily influenced by exchanges with Doboy Sound and the other which is 
influenced by its twice-daily contact with the marsh surface.  
	
Sapelo Island is only accessible by passenger ferry.  Due to its 
isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the SAP NERR show relatively 
little evidence of human impact.  Thus the Marsh Landing dock, where the Lower 
Duplin site is located, the primary access point for the approximately 200-300 
residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off loading was chosen as the 
most directly impacted site.  The Lower Duplin site is also readily accessible 
and centrally located within the SAP NERR.  The University of Georgia Marine 
Institute has used this as a monitoring site for years and SAP NERR continues to 
do so.  The Hunt Dock site was selected in July 1999 for monitoring.  It is a 
dock only used for transporting hunters during the fall season.  It is further 
up the Duplin, where the primary usage of the river is for pleasure boating and 
crabbing.  Therefore it is considered the least impacted site.  The University 
of Georgia-Athens continues to monitor further up the Duplin and the Flume Dock 
site.

4.   Research Methods:

	The SAP NERR Water Quality Monitoring began in October of 1999, at the 
Marsh Landing Dock on the lower Duplin River.  At this time we are only 
performing long term water quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.  
Prior to April 15, 1999 the University of Georgia-Athens Marine Institute 
(UGAMI) completed sampling. When SAP NERR took over the NERR monitoring from the 
University of GA, a second site was set up at the Marsh Landing site to be the 
NERR monitoring station.  In order to lesson the confusion between the 2 sites, 
the SAP NERR site is referred to as the Lower Duplin site (LD) and is monitored 
at a fixed depth from the bottom (0.5m).  In June 2002, the reserve returned to 
including the University's monitoring sites. These sites are at a fixed depth 
just below the surface.  The sites include the Marsh Landing site, (ML) and the 
Flume Dock (FD). They are both hung by stainless steel chains from floating 
docks at a fixed depth, approximately 1.5 m. The Hunt Dock (HD) site is just 
south of the Flume Dock site and also measures at 0.5m above the surface bottom. 
Because the ML and FD sites are surface deployments the amount of fouling is 
much worse when compared to the LD and HD sites.  In an effort to improve the 
data, the YSI EDS sondes are used exclusively at these sites and the 6000 series 
and 6600 series sondes are used at the LD and HD sites.  The EDS sondes reduce 
some of the fouling, but there is still considerable deterioration of probe 
sensitivity during deployment. 

	Before each YSI PC6000 data logger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Calibration 
standards are only required for pH, conductivity, and turbidity, all other 
parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 2-point 
calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased from a scientific supply house.  The 
conductivity standard is made using a 0.2 M solution of KCl (24.82mS/cm = 14.92 
g/L) or from serial dilution of a certified conductivity standard.  The 
turbidity calibration uses distilled water made by the University of Georgia-
Athens Marine Institute and a purchased 100 NTU certified standard.  The 
dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit 
at least 24 hours prior to deployment.  Calibration is then verified by running 
a standard as a sample after each calibration. 

	When deployed the weather conditions and tidal stage are recorded in the 
field observation log. The data logger is placed inside a length of PVC pipe 
attached to the dock.  The Lower Duplin data logger is attached to the north 
side of a non-floating dock by a steel cable and run down a PVC pipe to rest 
0.5m above the surface bottom.  The Hunt Dock data logger is attached to the 
south side of a fixed dock by steel cable and run down a PVC pipe to take 
measurements 0.5m above the surface bottom. Because of the large tidal range, 
water is continually flushed through the PVC pipes, thus eliminating the problem 
of creating a stagnate column of water with in the pipe with data logger. Every 
30 minutes during the sampling period measurements are taken for temperature, 
specific conductance, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, percent 
saturation, depth and turbidity.
	 
	At the end of the sample period the data logger is retrieved and immediately 
replaced by another calibrated data logger.  The data logger is then taken to 
the lab and runs QA/QC standards for pH, and conductivity, and dissolved oxygen, 
the data is uploaded, and the sonde is cleaned.  Data is removed if the post 
calibration standards fail or if technical problems are noted.  All data removed 
is noted in the metadata.


5.  Site Location and character:
	
	The monitoring site is located on the Marsh Landing Dock in the Duplin 
River on Sapelo Island.  Water passing the Marsh landing site during flood tide 
originates from the Doboy Sound.  The Doboy receives input from the Atlantic 
Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway. The water is 
pushed up the river or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh 
surface by the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb tide.  
Both the Lower Duplin data and Marsh Landing data is collected at the Marsh 
Landing Dock.

	The dock itself is used as the main dock to the island where the ferry 
makes several daily runs.  There are also several small boats that are docked 
there.  The surrounding area vegetation is dominated by salt marsh with Spartina 
being the predominate flora. Latitude and longitude for Lower Duplin site is as 
follows:  31 deg 25' 4" N, 81 deg 17' 46" W); Latitude and longitude for Hunt 
Dock site is as follows: (31 deg 28' 43", 81 deg 16' 23" W); Tidal range maximum 
for both sites is 14 feet and the salinity range is 5-35 ppt. 

	The Hunt Dock monitoring site is located on the Duplin River, off of Moses 
Hammock, which is separated by Sapelo Island by a small tidal channel.  The 
primary runoff at the site is from tidal creeks flowing through Spartina marsh 
and through the mud.  Bottom habitat at this site includes soft mud and some 
oyster bed building along the shoreline. There is little human traffic this far 
up the Duplin and it is north of the people living on Sapelo. During the fall, 
the Hunt dock and Moses Hammock are the camping and docking site for deer 
hunters traveling to the island.  These are controlled hunts and dates are 
available from the SAP NERR office if needed.  The Flume Dock site is located 
further up the Duplin River, around Moses Hammock.  

	The Flume Dock (31 deg 28' 58" N, 81 deg 16' 3" W) and Marsh Landing (31 deg 25' 
4" N, 81 deg 17' 46" W) sites have sondes connected to a floating dock.  
They hang by stainless steel chain at a fixed depth approximately one meter 
below the surface of the water.  These sites were used since 1986 by the UGA 
Marine Institute. In  June of 2002, the data collection was consolidated by the 
SAP NERR and the University.  Because of the fixed placement of the sondes at 
the water surface the fouling of the probes is a continuous problem. The data 
will reflect this problem.

	There are no current studies on pollutants in this area. Sapelo Island is 
typically considered a pristine environment, with the only pollutants nearby 
being contributed by the ferry dock and ferry parking lot.

8.  Associated researchers and projects:

Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the 
University of Georgia Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the island became 
a working laboratory for many.  The research continues today with SAP NERR and 
UGAMI creating a unique partnership with much of the current research being done 
facilitated by SAP NERR and UGAMI together.  Given UGAMI's long history on 
Sapelo, a bibliographic list of over 800 articles of current and previous 
research can be found on the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/ugami).

February
2/1/02 0:00 - 2/28/02 23:30 no turbidity probe deployed
2/1/02 16:00 - 19:30 no data recorded by sonde, not even the date and 
time.  
2/22/02 16:00 DO values substantially increase with the new deployment.  
The low values from the previous deployment (2/1/02-2/22/02) are 
suspect.  It is difficult to say why the values show such a discrepancy 
between the two sondes.  Both sondes passed the accepted post 
calibration procedures, therefore the data was retained. 
The following times had all data removed due to exposure above the 
water's surface during low tide:

April
4/1/02 0:00 -  4/12/02 8:30 all data missing, sonde had technical 
failure.
4/12/02 9:00 - 4/30/02 23:30 During this deployment the sonde became 
heavily fouled.  This probably accounts for the unusually high 
turbidity values and the degradation of the other parameters' values.  
The data was reported but should be considered suspect.  

The following times turbidity values reported were out of range.  Data 
was maintained, though should be considered suspect. Sonde very fouled 
during deployment.

August
The following times turbidity values reported were out of range.  Data 
was maintained.  The negative values often occur for values close to 
O.00. The high values are caused by an known reason, possibly by fish 
that was caught in the guard.

Flume Dock

Due to the nature of the deployment, the sondes deployed at the flume 
dock are very prone to heavily fouling.  Anti-fouling paint has not 
appeared to improve the situation, nor has the new EDS sondes developed 
by YSI.  All data from this site when evaluated, should take this into 
consideration, especially turbidity because it consistently
reads negative.  It is a problem the reserve is well aware of and trying 
to improve.

June
6/1/02 0:00 - 6/17/02 14:30 no sonde deployed
6/29/02 2:30 turbidity spike (849 NTU), cause unknown
6/30/02 2:30 turbidity spike (171 NTU), cause unknown
Turbidity values reading negative throughout deployment.  This occurs 
when value is near 0.
06/17/02 15:00 - 07/04/02 13:30 Specific Conductivity suspect because data 
deteriorates as sonde becomes fouled.
pH data for deployment 06/17/02 15:00 - 07/04/02 13:30 deleted due to broken pH 
probe installed in datalogger not collecting true data. 

July 
pH data for deployment 06/17/02 15:00 - 07/04/02 13:30 deleted due to broken pH 
probe installed in datalogger not collecting true data.
06/17/02 15:00 - 07/04/02 13:30 Specific Conductivity suspect because data 
deteriorates as sonde becomes fouled.
07/22/02 15:00 – 07/31 14:30 DO saturation and concentration deleted due to 
possible membrane failure.
The following values for turbidity are anamolous.  The negative values 
typically indicate values near 0.  The data was not deleted, though 
because of its erratic values, it should be considered suspect.   
The probe becomes very fouled despite the new EDS wiper system.

November

One of the sondes deployed from 10/16 -11/1/02 read the time one hour 
off.  The data was adjusted for this when compiled.
The following are anomalous turbidity values. High values are probably 
due to fouling of probe

December
One of the sondes deployed from 12/2 -12/17/02 read the time one hour 
off.  The data was adjusted for this when compiled.
Turbidity was deleted for deployment 12/17/02 12:00 - 12/31/02 23:30 due to 
calibration error. 


Marsh Landing:
Due to the nature of the deployment, the sondes deployed at the Marsh 
Landing site are very prone to heavy fouling.  Anti-fouling paint has 
not appeared to improve the situation, nor has the new EDS sondes 
developed by YSI.  All data from this site when evaluated, should take 
this into consideration, especially turbidity because it consistently
reads negative.  It is a problem the reserve is well aware of 
and trying to improve.

12/5/02 4:00 - 12/9/02 15:00 no data collected, sonde battery failure.  
12/9/02 15:30 - 12/23/02 10:30 turbidity data removed
12/9/02 -12/23/02 10:30 sonde time program is one hour off.  
Adjustments were made during data compilation.
12/9/02 15:30 - 12/23/02 10:30 DO values steadily increase, cause 
unknown.  


12. Missing Data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing 
due to equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other remarks:
Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
