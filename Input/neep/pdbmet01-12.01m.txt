2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The 
CDMO Data Logger Program (PADBA_01.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls 
the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for 
the data collection schedule).  The data is downloaded once a month in the field to a 
Toshiba laptop computer connected to the storage module using PC208W software supplied by 
Campbell Scientific. 

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program 
was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 
2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  
There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited 
monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces 
error and summary reports. All anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in 
the "Data anomalies/ Data corrections" section, along with any corrections that were 
preformed.  The raw data and Access tables are stored on the laptop, on the desktop 
SWMP computer in the lab and archived on zip disks. 

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports are "Air temp difference (over a 15 
minute time period) is greater than 3.0 degrees C" and "Rel hum difference (over a 15 
minute time period) is greater than 25%". All errors were double checked with other data 
that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted in Section 11.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record meteorological data at Padilla Bay for use in 
studies investigating correlations between meteorological data and water quality data, 
biological data, or other phenomenon in Padilla Bay and its watershed.


4) Research methods:

Data is downloaded once a month from the weather station because the storage module can 
only hold 49 days of data before the datalogger begins to overwrite data and the Weather 
Data Management Program cannot organize and sort raw data files that span more than two 
months. The sensors are visually inspected at this time for debris or damage except for 
the PAR sensor that cannot be seen from the ground so is inspected less often. Due to the 
location of the weather station in the middle of flat farm fields the sensors require 
very little cleaning. The most common problem occurs seasonally from air borne seeds 
partially blocking the rain gauge funnel. To mitigate this problem weeds near the site 
are cut before they can set seed. 

Sensors are sent in to Campbell Scientific to be calibrated according to their 
maintenance schedule recommendations. On occasion very high or very low barometric 
pressures were checked against weather data collected in Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island.


5) Site location and character:

Padilla Bay (48º 30' N; 122º 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern Puget Sound 
located in the greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary. It is an "orphaned" estuary in 
that the Skagit River, which formed the delta mud flats of Padilla Bay, no longer enters 
the bay directly. The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera marina, which 
covers approximately 3,000 ha. Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, now 
covers about 350 ha of the bay. Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with a mean range of 1.55m. 
Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU. Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay 
watershed is agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay. Some 
freshwater from the Skagit now enters Padilla Bay from the south through the Swinomish 
Channel which connects Padilla Bay to Skagit Bay. Other major freshwater flows into this 
area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the 
north. Padilla Bay is bordered on the east and south by flat, diked farmland; farther to 
the east are foothills of the Cascade Range. March Point, on the western edge of the 
reserve, is the site of two large oil refineries. To the north and west are the San Juan 
Islands of northern Puget Sound. 

The weather station is located on Padilla Farm near the southeast corner of Padilla Bay on 
a 40 hectare demonstration farm that is owned by the Reserve (48º 27' 50.58" N; 
122º 28' 4.81" W . Flat fields that are farmed for seasonal crops surround the site. 
Access is off Bayview-Edison road about 150 m down a gravel driveway.

The sensors are mounted on a 3 m tower that is secured to a concrete pad as specified by 
the manufacturer, Campbell Scientific. The relative humidity/temperature sensor is 
mounted 2 m high and the wind and PAR sensors are at the top of the tower 3 m above 
ground level. The tipping-bucket rain gauge is bolted to a slab of wood that is attached 
to the top of a 55-gallon metal drum filled with water for stability, the top of the rain 
gauge is 1.2 m above ground level. Surrounding the site is a six-foot high chain link 
fence for security. The weather station is about 300 m from the diked edge of the bay and 
approximately 4 km SE of the Bayview Channel YSI deployment site and about 4 km south of 
the Padilla Bay Research Reserve laboratory.

January 2001
During the first nine days of the month there were no sensors installed at the weather 
station because they had been removed for calibration. See Missing Data Section. 

On January 10th wind direction and velocity sensors, PAR sensor, and Temp/RH probe were 
installed and began recording at 13:00. Rainfall and barometric pressure data are missing 
for the entire month because these sensors were not installed. Even though no sensor was 
installed values for barometric pressure were recorded for the month beginning on January 
10, 13:00 so these data were removed as indicated in the error report:

November 2001
Sometime between down loading data at the weather station on November 8 and December 5 
the funnel on the rain gauge became clogged and was dislodged. Since there was no rain 
data recorded after November 15 and there was a storm event that began on November 14 the 
funnel was probably dislodged by high winds sometime on the 14th when for three hours 
from 19:00 to 22:00 the wind speed averaged over 12.6 m/s (~28 mph) with gusts up to 
19.25 m/s (~43 mph). Rain data on November 14 and December 5 should be considered 
incomplete and all rain data between these dates is missing.

Rainfall and barometric pressure data are missing for the entire month because these 
sensors were not installed, they had been returned to the manufacturers for calibration.


February 2001
The rain gauge and barometric pressure sensor were installed on February 13th just after 
13:30.  It was later discovered that the rain gauge was not working properly so rain data 
is missing for this month. 


March 2001
The rain gauge was not working properly so rain data is missing for this month.


April 2001
Rain data is missing for this month.  See anomalous data section. 

Station was powered down.

Rain data is missing for this month.  See anomalous data section. 

The rain gauge was removed and sent back to the manufacturer after discovering it had not 
been calibrated in January as when it was first sent in.


July 2001
There was no rain gauge installed from July 1 at 00:00 to July 10 at 13:00 so rain data 
is missing for this time period.

13) Other Remarks/notes

On January 10th the sensors were reinstalled after being calibrated. On April 3rd a new 
program was downloaded that contained a new multiplier for the LiCor PAR sensor. It was 
later discovered to be incorrect because the output value on the certificate of 
calibration from LiCor was in different units, millivolts, than the usual microamps. The 
millivolt output was already corrected for the resistor so when that value was put into 
our equation for the multiplier the resistor value was factored in a second time. All of 
the PAR data from April 3rd at 13:15 through the end of the year was corrected by 
multiplying all 15-minute data by a correction factor of .604 (the ratio of the 
correct/incorrect multiplier) then the data was recompiled using the Weather Data 
Management Program.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.
