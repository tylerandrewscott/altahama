2. Entry verification.
	The data contained herein were directly downloaded from the YSI 6000 data 
sonde to the PC6000 software on a DOS-based 486 computer.  The data were graphed 
and printed using the pc6000 software and then exported to Microsoft Excel.  Charting 
and plotting routines within PC6000 and Excel were used to verify the accuracy of the 
data.  In addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros provided by the CDMO were used to format and 
check the dataset for outliers beyond what the probes measure.  Outliers and erroneous 
data were also checked manually using the protocol defined in Appendix B of CDMO 
Operations Manual (v. 3.0).  Pat O¹Donnell was responsible for all data management.  

3. Research objectives.
	Henderson Creek, the area in which one of our data sondes is deployed, is the 
Reserve’s principal water conduit feeding the estuary and the Gulf of Mexico.  
Henderson’s watershed is almost entirely under public ownership, though historically 
much of its acreage was privately owned and developed.  Consequently, the Henderson 
system represents a restored watershed and estuary and serves as a management model 
for southwestern Florida.  For this reason, the Reserve is interested in long-term 
monitoring of its water quality.  The first sonde, which has been in place since early 
November, 1996, is located high within the estuary where salinities fluctuate drastically 
through tidal cycles and through seasonal changes in climate.

In February,  our second sonde was moved to the upper Blackwater River from the Big 
Marco Pass area.  The Big Marco sonde focused on a research initiative concerning the 
coastal linkages of processes and effects between estuaries and nearshore marine settings 
(just offshore in the Gulf of Mexico).  The Big Marco sonde was first deployed in mid-
January, 1997 and removed in mid-February, 1998.  It was located far downstream 
within the estuary, at the estuary’s mouth to the Gulf (Big Marco Pass). 

In contrast to the upper Henderson Creek, the Blackwater River system is a relatively 
undisturbed system not as influenced by development upstream in its watershed.  The 
objective of moving the second sonde to the Blackwater River system is to compare an 
altered and restored estuarine system(Henderson Creek) with a relatively 
undisturbed/underdeveloped estuarine system(Blackwater River).  The second sonde was 
first deployed in late February, 1998 in the upper portion of the river(mimicing the upper 
Henderson sonde).

4. Research methods.
	Both sondes are housed within 4-inch diameter, PVC pipes which are attached to 
“aid-to-navigation” pilings.  The pipes are oriented vertically, hug the pilings, and are 
attached with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom portion of the pipe is open and sits 
6 inches above the bottom.  Probe tips are therefore taking measurements approximately 
6-8 inches above the substrate.  Numerous 1-inch diameter holes are drilled 
circumferentially around the lowest 8 inches of the pipe to ensure adequate water flow 
around the probes.  Sondes are hung by galvanized steel chain inside the pipes; the chain 
is bolted to the piling.  A ‘kryptonite’ bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde inside the 
housing.
	The sondes are further protected from fouling by restricting the openings within 
the sonde guard with plastic screening.  During the first couple of deployments  
arthropods (crabs & amphipods) and, in one case, a toad fish, took up residence within 
the sonde guard and undoubtedly interfered with the probes.  As a precaution, plastic 
mesh (with 0.5 cm square holes) was attached on the inside of the guards’ circumference 
and on the inside of the guards’ lowermost disk.
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific conductivity, 
turbidity and dissolved oxygen following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating 
and Service Manual.  A two point calibration is used for pH(Fisher buffers 7& 10) and 
turbidity(0 & 40 NTU from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution is 
prepared to calibrate specific conductivity while dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % 
saturation.  Sondes are deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 weeks 
time the fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling period is set for 30-minute 
intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the half hour).  The following physical 
water quality parameters are recorded:  temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen(mg/l), dissolved oxygen(% saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A 
post-deployment calibration is done after the sonde is taken out of the water using the 
same calibration protocol.  
In April, southwestern Florida switched from Eastern Standard Time (EST) to 
Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT).  NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and 
the original data files are reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST).

5. Site location & character.
	The “Upper Henderson” site is located on the upper region of Henderson Creek.  
The piling(manatee caution sign) is located right of center (while facing downstream) of 
the creek channel, approximately 50 meters downstream of State Hwy 951’s crossing of 
Henderson Creek.
	UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone 17, datum NAD-27):
		E429855.23
		N2881137.96
	Lat/Long:	
		26° 02’ 56.46587” N
		81° 42’  4.21595” W
	This segment of Henderson Creek is bordered by red mangrove forest.  A 
residential area, consisting of trailer parks, is located immediately upstream.  These may 
be delivering point-source pollutants.
	The substrate within the channel is composed of organic-rich, black mud.  The 
water depth varies between 0.5 and 1.5 meters, depending on the state of the tide.  
Salinities fluctuate daily with the tides and seasonally with rainfall.
	
The “Big Marco Pass” site’s sonde housing is affixed to ATON day marker #2 at 
the confluence of Calhoun Channel and Isle of Capris Pass, just inshore of Big Marco 
Pass (for whom the locality is named).  Waters leaving the estuaries from both the 
Calhoun and Isle of Capris passes are consequently sampled by this sonde; waters 
traveling within Johnson Bay and Henderson Creek are represented.  ATON marker #2 is 
positioned on the south edge of the intracoastal waterway canal.  A housing development 
on Isle of Capris is located nearby to the south; the northern edge is lipped by red 
mangrove islands.
	UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone 17, datum NAD-27):
		E426177		
		N2873406
	Lat/Long:
		25° 58’ 44.47” N
		81° 44’ 15.00” W
	The substrate within the channel is composed of quartz sand.  Swift tidal currents 
travel through the channel, but a healthy epibenthos is supported (including, but not 
limited to, sponges, ascidians, crabs, and amphipods).  Salinities here are marine (33-35 
ppt); there appears to be little freshwater influence.  Depth ranges from 1.2 - 2.3 m, 
depending upon the state of the tide.

	The “Blackwater River” sonde is located upstream at a juncture which leads to a 
small bay named Mud Bay.  The sonde is affixed to navigational marker #47 within the 
river channel
	UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone 17, datum NAD-27):
		E440798
		N2872324
	Lat/Long:
		25° 58.067’ N
		81° 35.450’ W
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and mud with little to no 
vegetation.  The edges of the river are dominated by red mangroves and the Collier 
Semimole State Park boat basin is located further upstream.  Salinities range from 20-
30ppt on average and fluctuate daily with the tides and seasonally with rainfall.

	To reference these sites on a nautical chart, see NOAA chart #11430 – “Lostmans 
River to Wiggens Pass”.

6. Data collection period.
	Between January & December 1998, 26 sonde deployments occurred at Upper 
Henderson Creek; 3 deployments occurred at Big Marco Pass; 22 deployments occurred 
at Blackwater River.

Blackwater River was on 02/25/98] 

7. Associated researchers & projects.
	Dr. Mike Shirley (at RKBNERR - email: shirley_m@dep.state.fl.us) has a 
telemetered YSI 600 monitoring station recording the same physical water quality 
parameters (minus turbidity) at both sites downstream from the Upper Henderson Creek 
and the Blackwater River site.  These units are deployed, serviced and calibrated using 
different protocols.  These data are also available upon request.

10. Data anomalies.


Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, January 1998:
(a) Dissolved oxygen.  The DO values for this deployment seem unusually high,
but not out of range for the sensor.  All values will remain in the database,
but should be considered suspect for the following dates/times:
01/01/98  00:00 through 01/13/98  13:30

(b) Turbidity.  Two out of range(negative or >1000 NTU) anomalous values were 
recorded and will be deleted for the following dates/times:
01/01/98  19:30 	1331.3 NTU
01/04/98  13:00	 -145.1 NTU

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, February 1998:
(a) Dissolved oxygen.  DO values are low and occasionally drop below zero.  The 
DO probes eventually stopped working properly in June, but no other reasons 
exist to discard this data.  All DO data should be considered suspect, while 
negative DO values will be deleted from the dataset between the following 
dates/times:
02/19/98  07:30 through 02/24/98  04:00

(b)	Turbidity.  Turbidity values were slightly negative (possibly due to 
calibration error with 40 NTU standard), but will remain in the dataset for the 
following dates/times:
02/18/98  	02:30	
02/20/98  	13:00	
02/24/98  	09:30	

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, March 1998:
(a) Dissolved oxygen.  DO values are low and occasionally drop below zero.  The 
DO probes eventually stopped working properly in June, but no other reasons 
exist to discard this data.  All DO data should be considered suspect, while 
negative DO values will be deleted from the dataset between the following 
dates/times:
03/01/98  10:30 through 03/12/98  10:30
03/19/98  01:00 through 03/24/98  07:00

(b)	Turbidity. Turbidity values were slightly negative (possibly due to calibration 
error with 40 NTU standard), but will remain in the dataset for the following 
dates/times:
		03/02/98	23:00	
		03/03/98	00:00	
		03/09/98	06:00	
		03/09/98	09:00	
		03/09/98	14:00	
		03/09/98	21:30	

(b) Turbidity.  One out of range(negative or >1000 NTU) anomalous value was 
recorded and will be deleted for the following dates/times:
03/07/98  	06:00	1075.3 NTU

(c) Turbidity.  Many high values occurred, some of which are out of range for  
the probe.  These values appear to be real due to a sharp drop in 
salinity(freshwater input).  These values will remain in the database, but 
should be considered suspect for the following dates/times:
03/20/98  23:00 through 03/25/98  14:00

probe.  The probe wiper was not changed prior to deployment possibly 
causing the wiper to obstruct the optical sensor.  They also could be real 
values due to freshwater input into the system.  These values will remain in 
the database, but should be considered suspect for the following dates/times:
08/02/98  12:00 through 08/09/98  22:00

*** In February,  our second sonde was moved to the upper Blackwater River from the 
Big Marco Pass area.  ***

Site #2: Blackwater River, February 1998:
(a) Turbidity.  One out of range(>1000NTU) turbidity anomaly occurred and will
