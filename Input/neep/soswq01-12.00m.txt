2.	Entry verification
The data are uploaded from two YSI-6000 and one YSI-6600 data loggers using the 
PC6000 or EcoWatch software.  Graphs are printed for an initial visual QA/QC 
check of the data. Using the Export command, the .dat files are saved in the 
PC6000 software as .csv files.  Data are then imported into an EXCEL spreadsheet 
using the Import macro designed by CDMO.  Data files are revised using CDMO 
Excel 5.0 macros that: 1) add periods to cells with no data points; 2) check for 
outliers; 3) check for correct date and time intervals; and 4) format the data 
columns to the CDMO standard.  The file is then printed out, and the data 
reviewed.  Data are not deleted unless supporting reasons can be documented.  
The data files are saved as Text files (tab delimited) within the EXCEL software 
to be submitted to the CDMO via FTP.  Sue Powell has been in charge of data 
management since 9/99. 

3.	Research objectives
South Slough is characterized as a drowned river-mouth estuary that is 
characteristic of the Lower Columbia Biogeographic Region.  A series of long-
term monitoring stations have been established along the estuarine gradient of 
the South Slough in order to collect essential baseline information and improve 
our understanding of tidal dynamics and watershed inputs. One station serves as 
a reference site and is located in the Sengstacken Arm (SA)(Talbot Creek) 
adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural marsh.  The second station serves as a non-point 
assessment site.  It is located in the Winchester Arm (WA)of the slough adjacent 
to a dike-removal/marsh restoration area (5.1 ha) and 4.2 ha of natural marsh 
(Rumrill and Cornu 1995).  The Valino Island site (VA), installed in June 1999, 
is a second reference area which is located in the main tidal channel of South 
Slough, downstream from both of the other sites. In particular, the South Slough 
NERR/SWMP monitoring stations collect continuous information to address three 
primary topics:  1) short-term variability and long-term changes 
in estuarine water parameters within different regions of the estuary (i.e., 
localized impacts of seasonal storm events, variability in water quality 
parameters in association with re-establishment of tidal circulation, 
interannual differences in rainfall, magnitude and influence of El Nino - La 
Nina events, spatial extent of oceanic and tidal forcing, and long-term changes 
associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, etc.); 2) verification,
calibration, and future refinement of an existing two-dimensional water quality 
model (CE-QUAL-W2) developed to predict levels of coliform bacteria and 
dispersion of environmental toxins; and 3) collection of fundamental baseline 
data for future development of a three-dimensional tidal hydrodynamic model for 
the greater South Slough/Coos Bay estuaries. 

4.	Research methods
YSI data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameter measurements 
every 30 minutes over 22-30 day periods at all three stations.  Sonde cleaning 
and calibrations of the DO, conductivity, depth, pH, turbidity, and chlorophyll 
probes are performed as outlined in the YSI manual.  For conductivity and 
salinity, YSI conductivity calibrator solution 3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used 
without dilution.  For pH calibrations, Corning pH 7 and 10 solutions are used, 
and for turbidity Hach turbidity standard is diluted to 100 NTU.  The 
chlorophyll probe is calibrated with distilled water.  At deployment, the data 
loggers are lowered by chain into protective cases (constructed from 4" diameter 
ABS plumbing pipe) that are affixed vertically to existing log pilings driven 
into the mud.  The cases were drilled out to ensure adequate tidal flushing and 
exposure of the probes to ambient water conditions.  The sensor arrays are held 
0.5 m off the bottom of the tidal channels that are approximately 3 m deep.  The 
sondes are deployed and retrieved by skiff, and are out of the field for 20-60 
hours for cleaning, downloading and calibration.  Post-deployment calibrations 
are performed immediately upon retrieval to determine if instrument drift has 
occurred.  All data are recorded in Standard Time.  Because the chlorophyll 
probe is still in the testing phase, the data are not transmitted to CDMO.

5.	Site location and character
South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-
Pacific portion of the Columbian Bioregion, extending from Cape Mendicino, CA 
north to the Columbia River, OR estuary.  The South Slough, located five miles 
southwest of Coos Bay, Oregon, is one of seven tidal inlets that collectively 
form the Coos estuary.  Generally, the land-use pattern is 80-95% forested, and 
because of this use, pollution levels are very low, with only occasional nitrate 
fertilizer application in the county forest within the watershed.  Emergent 
vegetation is highly abundant and the predominant soil type is sand loam.  
Annual precipitation recorded at the North Bend FAA Weather Station ranges from 
50-90 inches, with a mean of 63 inches calculated since 1931.  

The three sites within the South Slough that are being monitored with YSI data 
loggers are:

1)  Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W]
This station serves as a reference site and is located within the riverine 
(southern) region of the Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek), a large tributary of 
South Slough.  The site is approximately 6.6 km from the mouth of the South 
Slough estuary and the channel depth is about 3 m.  Tidal range is approximately 
8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt.  The site is immediately adjacent 
to 4.3 ha of natural salt marsh, the drainage basin is 819.64 ha, the water body 
area is 15,297.1 m2, and the freshwater discharge is 203,881.3 cm3s-1.

2) 	Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project): 
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 19.216' W] This station serves as a management-treatment site and is 
located within the riverine (southern) portion of the Winchester Arm (Kunz 
Marsh), a large tributary of South Slough.  The site is approximately 7.1 km 
from the mouth of the South Slough estuary and the channel depth is about 3 m.  
Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt.  The 
site is adjacent to an experimental dike removal/marsh restoration area, where 
dikes were removed from a 5.1 ha area in 1996 and 1998.  About 4.2 hectares of 
natural marsh surround the project site.  The drainage basin represented by the 
site is 2,506.9 ha, the water body area is 15,815.1 m2, and the freshwater 
discharge is 509,703.2 cm3s-1.

Both sites 1 and 2 are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to 
intertidal marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera 
marina).  The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in 
channel width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel with regard 
to the predominant North-South winds.  The watershed above both sites is 
primarily second-growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial or 
residential sites in the watershed.

3) 	Valino Island:  [43 deg 19.034' N, 124 deg 19.298' W]
This station serves as a secondary reference area and is located in the marine-
dominated, main water body of the estuary immediately north of Valino Island.  
The site is approximately 3.6 km from the mouth of South Slough estuary.  
Situated in the primary tidal channel, the station is adjacent to expansive 
eelgrass beds, tidal mudflats, sandflats, and commercial oyster cultivation 
areas.  The tidal range is about 11.7 ft. and salinity ranges between 10-33 ppt.

7.	Associated researchers and projects
The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State 
of Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the 
Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development and the Oregon Department 
of Environmental Quality in July 1995. 

Two researchers are currently using water quality data recorded at the Valino 
YSI station.  Rick Cowlishaw, a Ph.D. candidate from the University of Oregon 
Institute of Marine Biology, is investigating the role of microzooplankton in 
planktonic energy transfer and community structure in an estuarine habitat.  His 
work is currently supported by a NERR Graduate Research Fellowship.  Chris 
Wilson, a Ph.D. candidate from Case Western University, is completing a 
comparison of sediment transport at three NERR sites.  His work is supported by 
the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental 
Technology (CICEET).

10.	Data anomalies
	
Editing of data followed CDMO protocol.  Data outside the range specifications 
of the instrument were rejected, except for depth and turbidity.  Negative depth 
values were not rejected unless they corresponded to specific conductivity data 
indicating that the sonde was out of the water.  Large positive turbidity spikes 
(>100 NTU) were reported in the anomalous data section.  In general, if no probe 
failure could be documented from the pre- and post-deployment calibration data, 
the data were retained but reported in the anomalous data section.  A hand-held 
YSI 85 was used for field calibration.  DO, temperature, salinity, and 
onductivity were recorded at the surface and near the bottom during deployment 
and retrieval of the sondes.  Because they simulated YSI recording locations, 
only recordings from the bottom were reported.
 
WINCHESTER (WI): 
January
