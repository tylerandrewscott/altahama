2)	Entry Verification:
	
	The 15-minute data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI Model 6200 Data 
Acquisition System via modem at 60-minute intervals.  The text files are 
imported into Excel.  Data that were recorded when the instruments were out of 
the water are deleted from the beginning and end of each record.  These data are 
identified by field notes that document the times in and out of the water, and 
by unusual depth and salinity data (usually near zero).  Graphs from Excel are 
evaluated for suspect data, as may result from probe failure.  Notes are made of 
any unusual data, and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  
	The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  In addition, a graphing capability is 
included to produce a single parameter and missing data graphs on a monthly 
basis.
	Anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete the 
suspect values.  Data are flagged if they fall outside the normal values seen at 
the site or outside the range of measurements and accuracy established for the 
sensors.  Data outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site 
were investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC 
checks, and instrument diagnostics.  Data are deleted if anomalies are 
attributed to sensor malfunction or fouling of the sensors by aquatic organisms, 
debris, or sediment.  Fouling of sensors is detected by comparing in-situ sensor 
readings with measurements.  In addition, sensor readings that differ 
significantly  (>10%) from calibration standards suggest that the sensor was 
fouled during deployment.  After corrections are made to the Excel worksheet 
(*.xls) and  anomalies noted in the metadata report, the edited files are 
exported as tab delimited (*.txt) and sent to the CDMO.  Monthly raw (*.dat) 
files are also sent to the CDMO for archival.  Carl Schoch and Katie Gaut are 
responsible for these tasks.

3)	Research Objectives:
	  The YSI electronic data loggers are programmed to measure the water 
temperature, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity 
conditions at 15-minute intervals.  Presently, two instruments are located in 
Kachemak Bay.  One is located on the north side of the bay at the end of the 
Homer spit.  The second is located on the southern side of the bay in Seldovia.  
	The circulation in Kachemak Bay is driven primarily by the 10 meter tidal 
flux.  Regional circulation is characterized by generally cyclonic ocean 
currents in the Gulf of Alaska flowing onto the shelf off of Cook Inlet.  
Nutrient rich bottom water is upwelled and mixed with surface water.  
These enriched waters stream into Kachemak Bay, the inflow tending to stay along 
the southern shore and the Seldovia instrument, while water flowing out of the 
bay stays along the north shore and the Homer instrument.  These trapped coastal 
flows separate the bay into two distinct ecosystems.
	As the inflowing water proceeds up the bay, fresh water runoff from the 
surrounding ice fields and watersheds dilute the salinity and increase the 
sediment load in the path of the Homer instrument.  The inflowing water, in the 
path of the Seldovia instrument, therefore, initially supports a marine system 
while the north out flowing water is more estuarine.  The Kachemak Bay water 
quality instruments capture this difference with deployments along the north and 
south shores.  Additional instruments deployed seasonally will monitor the 
degradation of the marine water along and across the axis of the bay.  These 
data will be used to supplement studies on primary productivity, larval 
distribution, settlement, recruitment, growth rates, community dynamics, and 
biodiversity in the bay.

4)	Research Methods:
	Two YSI 6600 Sonde Probes connected to 6200 Data Acquisition Systems were 
used for data collection.  The Data Acquisition System was connected via modem 
to a computer at the Research Reserve.  The data is collected in 15-minute 
intervals, stored on the 6200 DCP and interrogated, or downloaded, by our office 
computer once an hour.  Both instruments are housed in ABS pipe mounted 
vertically on the ferry docks of Homer and Seldovia.  The pipes are positioned 
to ensure that the sensors are approximately 1 meter above the bottom.  
	Calibration and deployment occurred monthly at both sites, using methods 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  After cleaning the data 
loggers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and allowed to stretch 
for 12 hours before the DO sensor is calibrated in water-saturated air.  The pH, 
conductivity, depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated using the following 
standards purchased from YSI (except depth): pH 7 and 10, conductivity standards 
of 50 mS/cm, turbidity standards of 0 and 100 NTU, respectively, and depth of 0.  
	
5)	Site Location and Character:
Kachemak Bay is located approximately 150 miles south of Anchorage, on the 
western shore of the Kenai Peninsula.  Kachemak Bay, at 59.6oNand 151.5o W, is a 
temperate regional fjord with hydrographic conditions unique among the NERR 
system estuaries.  The tidal range of 9 meters is the second largest in the 
world and salinity ranges from near zero at stream mouths to 34.0 at the 
entrance to the inner Bay.  The bay is 24 miles wide at its mouth and 
approximately 36 miles long.   The head of Kachemak Bay is located to the 
northeast at the Fox River Flats, and the mouth lies to the southwest, along a 
line between Anchor Point and Point Pogibshi. Kachemak Bay is split into inner 
and outer Bays by the four mile long Homer Spit that extends into the Bay from 
the northern shoreline. The Kachemak Bay NERR comprises the entire inner Bay and 
the outer Bay.  Water flows between the inner and outer Bays through a narrow 
opening formed between the Spit and the southern shoreline. The Bay has an 
average depth of 25 fathoms (150 feet) and a maximum of 100 fathoms (600 ft).
Fresh water introduced primarily by the Fox, Bradley, and Martin rivers and 
Sheep Creek at the head of the Bay, flows along the northwest shore of the inner 
Bay.  Peak release of fresh water from Bradley Creek alone results in flows of 
1200 cubic feet per second. This peak flow occurs in conjunction with the 
warmest summer temperatures.
The Homer YSI data logger site is located on the north side of Kachemak Bay 
(latitude and longitude: 59.6029ºN, 151.4081ºW).  It is mounted 1 meter above 
the bottom on the ferry terminal dock in water fluctuating between 1.8 and 10.8 
meters.  The bottom habitat is predominantly sand.  Pollutants in the area are 
primarily due to the excessive boat traffic at the entrance of the Homer harbor.  
Since monitoring began in July 2001, salinity has ranged from 20.5 to 31.7 ppt 
at this site.
	The Seldovia YSI data logger site is located on the south side of Kachemak 
Bay, approximately 15 miles from the Homer instrument (latitude and longitude: 
59.4413ºN, 151.7186ºW).  It is also situated on the ferry terminal dock, one 
meter above the bottom and located in water fluctuating between 5 and 13.3 
meters.  The access to Seldovia is limited to boat or air, as the site is 
remotely located off the highway system.  The power and phone line connection 
are occasionally inoperative due to the remote location and position at the end 
of the power grid.  The bottom habitat is predominantly rocky substrate.  
Pollutants in the area are minimal.  Since monitoring began in August 2001, 
salinity has ranged from 30 to 35.9 ppt at this site.

8)	Associated Researchers and Projects:
	Additional instruments deployed seasonally monitor the degradation of the 
marine water along and across the axis of the bay. These data are being used to 
supplement studies on primary productivity, larval distribution, settlement, 
recruitment, growth rates, community dynamics, and biodiversity in the bay.  
	In August 2000 and 2001, the spatial distribution of Nereocystis leutkeana 
kelp beds was mapped in the Kachemak Bay Research Reserve using low altitude 
aerial photography.  The photos were taken using a medium-format camera and a 
light fixed-wing aircraft to produce vertical and oblique digital imagery of 
individual kelp beds.  These images were geometrically corrected and the 
kelp beds delineated.  The polygon data were entered into a GIS so that 
estimates of areal extent and adjacency can be compared among beds and among 
years.  Results to date indicate a >10% decline in surface area of kelp beds.  
This was mostly due to the inundation of rocky habitat by sand over a small 
subtidal bench near the Homer Spit.  The variability of each kelp bed area and 
density will be tracked over time as an indicator of change and kelp community 
health.  We intend to continue these surveys for a minimum of ten years to track 
the kelp beds through at least one major cycle of known oceanic variability (the 
El Nino/Southern Oscillation).  The correlative work stemming from aerial 
surveys will help focus our experimental studies to determine the mechanisms of 
observed changes in population sizes and density.  In order to attribute the 
shifts in spatial patterns to specific agents of change, on-going research by 
our science staff is focusing on the effects of light limitation, salinity, and 
herbivory on kelp growth rates.

surge or other interruption in transmission of data:
07/12, 08:00:00
07/17, 09:15:00 - 13:45:00

b) During the following times, spikes in turbidity are suspect.  These reading 
were possibly caused by a clump of plant matter or sediment passing by the 
sensor optics during the sampling interval.
7/14, 22:00:00 (49 NTU)
7/27, 08:30:00 (62 NTU)

August 2001

Homer
	
a)   During this month, intensive construction was being performed on the pier 
where the   instrument was located.  Large spikes in the turbidity could be a 
result of this disturbance during the following time periods:
8/1,  07:00:00, 07:30:00, 21:30:00 (452, 211, 70 NTU)
8/6,  23:45:00 (578 NTU)
8/17, 08:30:00 (513 NTU)
8/18, 12:15:00 - 2:30:00, 13:30:00 - 14:00:00, 16:15:00 (883, 202, 625, 880, 
271, 1295 NTU)

b)	Specific Conductivity and DO concentration data were not logged during 
the following period due to an programming/setup incompatibility between the 
6200 DCP and 6600 sonde:
8/14, 06:45:00 - 8/18, 16:15:00
8/22, 15:30:00 - 8/23, 05:45:00
8/23, 18:30:00 - 8/24, 05:00:00
8/24, 17:15:00 - 8/25, 06:00:00

c)	Because of heavy construction on the pier where the instrument was 
located, the instrument was retrieved during the following time period:  
8/18, 16:30:00 - 8/22, 15:15:00

d)	During deployment that began on 08/22, there was a suspected problem with 
DO membrane integrity or puncture on 08/25 (spikes of 288% at 23:00).  All DO 
data generated from this puncture during the deployment were deleted during the 
following dates/times:
8/25, 06:15:00 - 9/09, 15:45:00

e)	At the following time there is an unexpected dip in DO% and concentration 
that is suspect:  
8/13, 18:45:00  (39.8% and 3.7 ms/cm).

f)	For an unknown reason, on 8/26, there are two sets of data for the entire 
day.  These data are duplicates and one set is deleted.

g)	During the following periods, pH falls below the normal range usually 
observed for this site (pH 7.8-8.2).  The causes of the low readings are not 
known at this time and are suspect.
8/14, 23:15:00 - 8/15, 00:00:00
8/25, 06:45:00 - 14:45:00, 20:30:00 - 22:45:00
8/26, 02:00:00 - 02:15:00

h)	During the following time period there is an unexplained dip in DO % that 
is suspect:  
8/18, 12:00:00 - 12:30:00 (33.6, 23.8, and 44.4 %).

i)	No data were logged during the following times possibly due to a power 
surge or other interruption in transmission of data:
8/23, 00:15:00, 06:00:00 - 18:15:00
8/24, 05:15:00 - 17:00:00
       
Seldovia

8/31, 15:30:00, 17:00:00 - 17:30:00, 18:15:00 - 19:30:00, 20:30:00 (14-50 NTU) 

b)	The Specific Conductivity and DO mg/L data were not logged during the 
entire deployment period due to a programming/setup incompatibility between the 
6200 DCP and 6600 sonde.

c)   No data were logged during the following times possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in relaying data:
8/20/01, 05:45:00 - 06:30:00

September 2001

Homer

a)   The following records are deleted turbidity readings greater than 1000 NTU, 
possibly due to debris or wiper covering the sensor optics during the sampling 
interval.
09/17, 06:15:00, 06:45:00 (1725, 1652 NTU)
09/18, 10:15:00 (1726 NTU)
09/20, 07:30:00, 15:15:00 (1727, 1320 NTU)

09/18, 08:45:00 (532 NTU)
09/20, 00:15:00, 07:00:00, 09:15:00 (749, 289, 473 NTU)
09/22, 23:15:00, 23:30:00 (71, 56 NTU)
09/25, 13:15:00 (42 NTU)
09/26, 17:15:00 - 17:45:00 (53,105,53 NTU)
09/28, 06:45:00 (33 NTU)

c) 	No data were logged during the following times due to sonde maintenance:
09/16, 09:15:00 - 10:00:00

d)	An increase in DO % is suspect during the following period:
09/07, 18:15:00 - 09/08 11:45:00 (122-165 NTU)


Seldovia
	
a)	No data were reported during the following periods possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in transmission of data.
09/11, 09:45:00-10:00:00
09/12, 09:45:00
09/16, 09:45:00 - 10:30:00
09/17, 14:45:00 - 15:15:00
09/18, 06:45:00, 10:45:00, 11:00:00
09/19, 05:45:00, 06:00:00
09/20, 06:45:00 - 07:15:00

b)	 Specific Conductivity and DO concentration data were not logged during 
the following period due to a programming/setup incompatibility between the 6200 
DCP and 6600 sonde:
09/01, 00:00:00 - 09/16, 09:30:00

c)	Data recorded on 09/08, 09:45 was probably measured while probe was out of 
water (salinity reading of 0.6, depth reading of 0.4, etc) and were deleted.

d)	Following the sonde deployment on 09/10, 19:30, incompatibilities of 
programming and setup was experienced between the 6200 DCP and 6600 sonde.  Due 
to these differences in setup, the column headings are reported incorrectly on 
the raw data, but properly aligned for the edited version.  

e)	On 09/11, a duplicate 07:30:00 reading was reported for an unknown reason.  
Both of the readings were deleted.  

f)	DO percentage reported out-of-range values during the following period 
most likely due to column heading mislabeling.  These data were deleted.    
09/11, 07:30:00 - 09/12, 09:30:00

g)	Turbidity values were reported out-of-range during the following period 
most likely due to mislabeled column headings due to 6200/6600 setup 
incompatibility.  These data were deleted.
09/10, 19:30 - 09/11, 09:30:00  

h)	From September through October, DO was higher than normal, 
however it was left in the dataset in order to compare the data for trends.  

October 2001

Homer

a)	Turbidity spikes at the following times are suspect:
10/3, 02:45:00 (823 NTU)
10/5, 23:45:00 (788 NTU)
10/6, 15:00:00 (490 NTU)
10/19, 02:00:00, 10:00:00  (237, 982 NTU)

b)	After deployment of sonde, setup incompatibility between the 6200 and 6600 
caused mislabeling of column headings.  The ph mV was left on, causing the 
turbidity reading to be unreported during the following period:
10/10, 07:45:00 - 10/15, 06:00:00

c)	Following the above period, the pH mV reading was disabled which allowed 
turbidity reading to again be reported correctly following 10/15, 06:15.

d)	No data were reported during the following periods possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in transmission of data.
10/14, 08:15:00 - 08:45:00



Seldovia

a)	No data were reported during the following periods possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in transmission of data.:
10/4, 9:45:00 - 10:00:00, 16:45:00 - 17:15:00

b)	All data abruptly reported out of range during the following period due to 
an unknown cause and deleted:
10/8, 9:15:00 - 10/9, 5:30:00

c)	From October through December, strong winds and dropping temperatures resulted
in higher salinities for this site.  

d)	From September through October, DO was higher than normal, 
however it was left in the dataset in order to compare the data for trends.

a)	Turbidity spikes are suspect at the following times:
11/14, 17:30:00, 17:45:00, 18:15:00, 18:30:00 (1388, 907, 1383, 1387 NTU)
11/15, 07:30:00 (1386 NTU)
11/16, 05:30:00 (122 NTU)
11/17, 18:30:00 (1381 NTU)
11/22, 22:00:00 (425 NTU)
11/23, 00:30:00, 08:30:00 (1242, 1397 NTU)
11/28, 18:00:00 (265 NTU)

b)	Suspect values for all probes are reported at the following time, most 
likely an error experienced while correction to programming between the 6600 and 
6200 was taking place:
11/29, 13:00:00 

c)   Setup incompatibility between the 6200 and 6600 caused mislabeling of 
column headings.  The ph mV, DO Charge, and Battery readings were left on from 
calibration, causing the DO concentration and salinity readings to be unreported 
during the following period: 
11/27, 10:30:00 - 11/29, 13:00:00

c)	Correction to the column headings caused a interruption in transmission of 
data during the following period: 
11/29, 13:15:00 - 14:15:00

d)	No data were reported during the following periods possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in transmission of data:
11/23, 09:00:00
11/27, 17:15:00

e)	Depth data were reported in feet during beginning period of deployment.  
The data were converted to meters post-deployment during the following period:
11/27, 10:30:00 - 11/29, 13:00:00

f)	Shift in DO on 11/27 1030 through end of the year is perhaps a result of 
instrument drift from previous deployments in October and November.  

Seldovia
		
a)	Dissolved oxygen concentration and percentage readings show an unexplained 
dip at the following times that are suspect:
11/11, 13:45:00  (8.2 mg/L, 85.2 %)

b)	The following turbidity spikes are suspect:
11/06, 20:00:00  (151 NTU)
11/08, 03:15:00, 17:45:00  (433, 455 NTU)
11/12, 14:15:00  (1374 NTU)
11/19, 19:00:00  (104 NTU)
11/25, 22:15:00, 23:00:00  (78, 271 NTU)
11/28, 03:15:00  (58 NTU)
11/29, 16:15:00  (258 NTU)

c)	No data were logged during the following times possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in transmission of data.
11/29/01, 14:30:00

d)	From October through December, strong winds and dropping temperatures resulted
in higher salinities for this site.  

December 2001

Homer
	 
a)	No data were logged during the following times possibly due to a power 
surge or interruption in transmission of data:
12/17, 17:15:00
12/21, 08:00:00

b)	Turbidity spikes are suspect at the following times:
12/12, 09:00:00, 09:15:00 (264, 125 NTU)
12/16, 02:00:00  (1391 NTU)
12/29, 06:00:00  (114 NTU)

Seldovia

a)	Deployment of new sonde during the following period resulted in no data 
collection.  The internal chip of the sonde was defective and returned to YSI 
for reprogramming.
12/4, 11:15:00 - 12/11, 11:00:00

b)	Deployment of calibrated sonde during the following period resulted in no 
data collection.  The modem connection was down and recovered after rebooting of 
machine on 1/11.  
12/11, 11:30:00 - 1/11, 11:30:00

c)	From October through December, strong winds and dropping temperatures resulted
in higher salinities for this site.  


12)	Missing Data:

	Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing 
due to equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the Kachemak Bay Research Reserve.
