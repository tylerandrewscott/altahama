2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:
The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each instrument 
on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger. The CDMO Data Logger 
Program (nerr3.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The 
CR10X then interfaced with the Campbell SM192 memory module for long-term data 
storage.

From January through December 2003 Campbell PC208W software was used to 
automatically dial up the weather station via a Campbell Com200 modem and upload data at 
five-minute intervals. The uploaded raw data (none QA/QC'd) was periodically transferred to 
a separate file for archival and future QA/QC purposes.

From January through November 19th Real time data management (RTDM) software 
produced joint photographic experts group (JPEG) image files displaying weather conditions 
at time of collection. The JPEG image files were exported to a network server maintained by 
Faulkner Community College in Fairhope, Al. and were available for viewing using an 
Internet connection. 

On November 19th the CR10X program was updated to match the requirements of the 
EQWin database software program, which will be employed at all NERR sites and replaces 
the WDMP. At this time a station identification number (711) was also introduced within 
the CR10X program. The identification number allows a Dauphin Island Sea Lab computer to 
remotely dial up and identify the Weeks Bay NERR weather station. The data generated from 
the weather station is converted to graphic representation and posted on the internet at 
http://cast-net.mobilebaynep.com/monitoringdata/default.asp 

At the end of the year monthly data files were compiled. From the dates of January 1st 
through November 19th (Julian day 323) the CDMO Weather Data Management Program 
(WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database. The WDMP program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of 
the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into an Access database.  There are 
three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw 
data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of 
error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and summary reports. Any 
anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data 
corrections that were performed are noted in the Missing/Deleted Data section below.  	
From November 19 1200 to the end of the year, compiled data files were opened in Microsoft 
excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro that was developed by the CDMO to 
insert a date column (mm/dd/yyyy), insert station codes, correct the time column format, and 
reformat the data to the appropriate number of decimal places. The pre-processed file was 
then copied into an EQWin weather.eqi file where the data was QA/QC checked and 
archived into a database. EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data set 
outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure) and 
large changes in the data. EQWin is also used to generate statistics, view graphs, create 
customized queries and finally export the data to the CDMO. Any anomalous data are 
investigated and noted below is the Anomalous/Suspect Data Section. Any data corrections 
that were performed are noted in the Deleted Data Section. Missing data due to probe failure 
or other reason are noted in the missing data section. 

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

3) Research objectives:

The principle objective is to record long-term meteorological data for Weeks Bay in order to 
1)observe any environmental changes or trends over time, 2) use as a reference for research 
projects at the reserve, and 3) give meteorological context to our half-hour SWMP water 
quality data. 

4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce hourly averages 
for arrays 101 and 102 (array 60 after 11/19) and daily averages, maximums and minimums 
for arrays 241,242 and 243 (array 144 after 11/19). Parameters measured are air temperature, 
relative humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An 
instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and assigned to array 150 (array 15 after 
11/19). Periodically, sensors on the weather station are inspected for damage or debris. If any 
is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned. Sensors are removed and calibrated on an annual or bi-
annual basis. The sensors and tower were obtained in the fall of 1996. However the sensors 
were not installed until the fall of 1998. Sensors were last calibrated in 2003. There were no 
other analyses done on the meteorological data at present.  


5) Site location and character:

The Weeks Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located near the Gulf coast, 
southeast of the city of Fairhope, Alabama. Weeks Bay (30deg 23' N, 87deg 50' W) is a small, 
shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern 
Gulf of Mexico. The bay is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) 
runs nearly north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to the mouth, where 
water is exchanged with Mobile Bay. Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near the center of 
the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side of Weeks Bay.  Average 
depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths are significantly greater.  The first 
is in the mouth of the bay, where the average depth is 6 m; the second is about 100 m 
upstream of the mouth of the Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m. Tides are 
principally diurnal, and have a mean range of 0.4 m.

The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 14300 hectares and contributes 
approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow with the Magnolia River supplying 
the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 cubic meters per second; although freshets up to 4 
times larger occur throughout the year.  These characteristics result in a freshwater residence 
time of 13 days under average discharge conditions, with a range from 0.5 to 100 days.  
Salinity in Weeks Bay varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  During periods of 
high flow in the river, salinity in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, except in 
the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  However, during periods of low 
flow in the river, wind velocity and tidal stage are strong factors influencing salinity 
structure.  Salinity greater than 25 ppt is infrequently observed in Weeks Bay and is usually 
restricted to the southern portion of the estuary near the mouth.

The weather station is located on a reserve owned pier (lat 30deg 24.89'N, long 87deg 
49.56'W) just south of the highway 98 bridge, on the west side of the mouth of the Fish 
River. Wind sentry, tipping bucket rain gauge, temperature/RH probe, and barometric 
pressure sensor are mounted along an aluminum tower between 4.8 and 7.6 meters above 
water surface. LI-COR quantum sensor was not deployed in 2001. Approximately 100 meters 
upstream is an YSI datalogger deployment site for the continuous monitoring of water 
quality. 


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected from January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2003. 
This metadata is applicable only to data collected from January 1, 2003 through December 
31, 2003.

14) Other Remarks/notes
No data was lost due to power down in 2003. A dedicated computer at Weeks Bay NERR  
calls up the weathers station at five-minute intervals retrieving and storing the data. At those 
times when the modem is unable to connect i.e. line interruptions, power outages at reserve, 
etc. the weather station information is stored in the SM192 module. Upon reconnecting with 
the weather station the stored information is then downloaded.

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
