2. Entry verification.
	The data contained herein were directly downloaded from the YSI 6000 and 
6600 data sonde to the PC6000 software on a Dell Optiplex GX100.  The data were 
graphed and printed using the PC6000 software and then exported to Microsoft 
Excel.  Charting and plotting routines within PC6000 and Excel were used to 
verify the accuracy of the data.  In addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros provided by 
the CDMO were used to format and check the dataset for outliers beyond what the 
probes measure.  Outliers and erroneous data were checked manually using the 
protocol defined in Appendix B of CDMO Operations Manual (v. 3.0). Finally, an 
internal screening macro, designed by Mike Shirley was used to weed out 
suspicious data. Person responsible for this task is Heather E. Stoffel. 

3. Research objectives.
	Henderson Creek, the system site #1, is Rookery Bay's principal water 
conduit feeding the estuary.  Most of the Henderson Creek system is under public 
ownership, though historically much of its watershed was privately owned and 
developed.  Additional components include a water control structure maintained 
by the South Florida Water Management District.  The structure is a gated 
arcflow spillway with a vertical sluice gate and flap gate.  There are two 
additional gated weirs on the east and west side ditches downstream of the main 
weir. This structure prevents salt-water intrusion and controls the water level 
to prevent continuous drainage for the Henderson Creek basin. Consequently, 
Henderson Creek represents an altered system and serves as a management model 
for water control issues in southwest Florida.  Altered timing and quality of 
freshwater has the potential to disrupt the biological processes of the Rookery 
Bay estuarine system.  The long term water quality monitoring began in early 
November 1996. Site  # 1 is located high within the estuary where salinities 
fluctuate drastically through tidal, seasonal, and management influences. 
In contrast to the Henderson Creek system, the Blackwater River system is a 
relatively undisturbed system. The Blackwater River watershed is primarily under 
state ownership with lessor amounts of agricultural influences.  The objective 
of moving the second site to the Blackwater River system is to compare an 
altered estuarine system (Henderson Creek) with a relatively undisturbed 
estuarine system (Blackwater River).  The second site was established in late 
February 1998 in the upper portion of the river (to be comparable to site # 1) 
and will remain the second site until January 1, 2000.
The station will be moved to a more permanent water quality monitoring station 
downstream.  The downstream location, middle Blackwater River, the system site 
#2, is RKBNERR's long term biomonitoring program.  There is hourly background 
data dating back to 1996.  This site was chosen based on its compatible use with 
the biomonitoring program and stable funds.
	These water quality stations are providing essential information to guide 
restoration efforts.  Grant funding through NMFS has been obtained to retrofit 
the Henderson Creek weir.  Water releases strategies based on the water quality 
information will be implemented to allow for a more natural freshwater inflow 
pattern.

4. Research methods.
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific 
conductivity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen following the procedures outlined 
in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  A two point calibration is used for pH 
(Fisher buffers 7& 10) and turbidity (0 & 100 NTU from Advanced Polymer Systems, 
Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution (YSI conductivity calibrator) is used to calibrate 
specific conductivity.  Dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % saturation.  Sondes 
are deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 weeks time the 
fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling period is set for 30-minute 
intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the half-hour).  The following 
physical water quality parameters are recorded: temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (mg/l), dissolved oxygen (% 
saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A post-deployment calibration is done 
after the sonde is taken out of the water using the same calibration protocol.  
 NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and the original data files are 
reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST).
Both sondes are housed within 4-inch diameter, PVC pipes, which are attached to 
"aid-to-navigation" pilings.  The pipes are oriented vertically and are attached 
tightly with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom portion of the pipe is 
open and sits 6 inches above the bottom.  Probe readings are measured 
approximately 6-8 inches above the substrate.  Numerous 1-inch diameter holes 
are drilled circumferentially around the lowest 8 inches of the pipe to ensure 
adequate water flow around the probes.  Sondes are hung by plastic coated steel 
chain inside the pipes; the chain is bolted to the piling.  A 'kryptonite' 
bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde inside the housing.
	The sondes are further protected from fouling by restricting the openings 
within the sonde guard with plastic screening. The plastic mesh (with 0.5-cm 
square holes) was attached on the inside of the guards' circumference and on the 
inside of the guards' lowermost disk. 

5. Site location & character.

Site #1- Upper Henderson (UH):
	The "Upper Henderson" site, site #1, is located on the upper region of 
Henderson Creek.  The piling (manatee caution sign) is located right of center 
(while facing downstream) of the creek channel, approximately 50 meters 
downstream of State Hwy 951's crossing of Henderson Creek.
Facing the channel, this segment of Henderson Creek has RKBNERR headquarters on 
the left bank and a mangrove restoration site on the right.  A residential area, 
consisting of trailer parks, is located immediately upstream.  These may be 
delivering point-source pollutants.
	The substrate within the channel is composed of organic-rich silt layer 
over fine grain sand.  The bottom is riddled with road debris and rocks from old 
seawalls.  Henderson Creek has tidal influences along with a fresh water control 
structure in its headwaters controlling its salinity range, 0-40 ppt. The tide 
range for Henderson Creek varies between 0.5 and 1.5 meters.

	Lat/Long:	
		26° 02' 56.46587" N
		81° 42'   4.21595" W
	 
Site #2- Middle Blackwater River (MB):	
	The " Middle Blackwater River" sonde, site #2, is located at the mouth of 
the river.  The sonde is affixed to navigational marker #17 within the river 
channel.
		The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with 
oyster shell matter mixed in.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of 
the river.  Upstream influences consist of Collier-Semonile State Parks boat 
basin and upstream agricultural fields, adjacent to Blackwater River's main 
feeder canal, SR 41 canal.  Salinities range from 0-40 ppt and fluctuate daily 
with the tides and seasonal rainfall.  The tidal range is 0.01 to 2 meters 
during extreme tides.

7. Associated researchers & projects.
	 RKBNERR also has a YSI 6000 & YSI 6600, using the same protocol, and 
YSI6600 monitoring station recording the same physical water quality parameters 
(minus turbidity) at corresponding river mouth locations of Gordon River, 
Henderson Creek, Faka Union Canal, and Fakahatchee River. These sights are 
examining the physical water quality parameters relating to freshwater inflow. 
These units are deployed, serviced and calibrated using the same protocols.  
These data are also available upon request.

Gates Opened:				Gates closed:
West ditch gate 09/11/00		West ditch gate 10/24/00
		   
East ditch gate 09/11/00		East ditch gate 10/24/00
		
Flap gate 09/18/00			Flap gate 09/19/00
		
Main gates #1 09/11/00			Main gate (1) 10/09/00
		   
Main gate #2   09/18/00			Main gate #2 10/12/00




b) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
