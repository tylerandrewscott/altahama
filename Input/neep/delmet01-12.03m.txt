2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded from 
each instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The 
CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr303.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the 
sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule).  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by 
Campbell Scientific.  

This software was located on a computer to which the data was uploaded (every 15 
minutes) via a short haul modem to a computer located at St. Jones Center for Estuarine 
Studies.  The data was saved as a raw data file (SJ_RAW.dat) onto a separate hard drive and 
backed up onto Delaware Coastal Programs' (DCP) server.  

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of 
the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and Access Database.  There 
are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly 
raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined 
set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and summary 
reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in Anomalous Data 
section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction section 
below. Data after November 14, 2003 (318) 915 were QA/QC'd using Gemtek's EQWin program. EQwin 
now replaces the WDMP as the NERR MET primary QA/QC program. All MET, WQ, and NUTS data are now
archived in an EQwin database.  SWMP weather data collected with CR10X program versions prior to 
version 4.0 were converted to the new format in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) 
with the new data format found in version 4.0 of the NERR_4.CSI (3 array output).  The new format 
produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) 
and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 and 151 
fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array; the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were 
converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted 
to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's 
to code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP 
weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s 
criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15 minute period, and precipitation 
difference of greater than 5mm in 15 minutes.  All errors of these types were double checked 
with other data that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted in the 
sections that follow. Wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria are common between 1900 and 
0600 hours and are not individually checked. Both raw data files and Access databases were 
saved to the DCP server with daily tape back-up. Mike Mensinger conducted data management and 
QA/QC activities.

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for the Blackbird component 
of the Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve in order to observe any environmental changes
 or trends over time. The data are also used for specific research studies relating to atmospheric 
deposition of nutrients and pesticides, andnutrient runoff influences from encroaching urbanization 
on estuarine systems.


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and 
daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric 
pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  Prior to installation of the version 4.0 of the 
NERR_4.CSI program, an instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data are stored in 
array 150.   After the NERR_4.CSI program was installed on November 14, 2004 (318) 915, data were
collected according to the schedule in section 2b.vi above.  The CR10X datalogger can store over 
three weeks of data before it overwrites the data, in addition there is a storage module that 
stores in excess of a month of data for backup. The data are sent every 15 minutes to a 
computer for real-time display and storage. If the short haul modem link failed and data 
could not be automatically sent from the datalogger to the computer the data would be 
downloaded from the CR10X to a laptop computer following procedures in Part D. Section 4.5 
of the CDMO Operations Manual.  Periodically, sensors on the weatherstation are inspected 
for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned.  Sensors are removed 
and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at minimum of every year. 


5) Site location and character:

The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component sites, the 
St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are located along the 
Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located in central Kent County 
Delaware, east of the State capitol city, Dover.  The Blackbird Creek component is located 
in the unincorporated area of Southern New Castle County.  The meteorological station site, 
is located in the St. Jones DNERR component. It is located in a tidal marsh area with a 
wooded fringe area 100 m to the north, 75 m to east, 75 m to the west and 1+ km to south. 
The wooded area is of an approximate average height of 16 m.

             Position:    Latitude   39 degree 05' 20.05" N
                          Longitude  75 degree 26' 12.78" W

The unit is mounted on a 3-meter tower adjacent to the boardwalk that crosses the marsh. 
The elevations above the marsh surface are as follows; Barometric pressure - 2.2 m, 
temperature and relative humidity - 2.9 m , wind and PAR - 4.5 m, highest point on tower 
(lightning rod) - 4.9 m. The rain gauge is 2.4 m above the surface and 3 m south of the 
tower. The adjacent boardwalk is 1.1 m above the surface with a railing height of 1.0 m. A 
vegetative cover of Spartina spp. surrounds the area with an average height of 1 m. The tower and 
rain gauge are both 1 m east of the boardwalk. The weatherstation is located approximately 2 
km from the water quality datasonde at Scotton Landing.


6) Data collection period:

The meteorological monitoring program was started in October 1997 at the DNERR and has 
been continuous through the present. The data collection format has followed NERRS 
protocol since standardized meteorological program development in November of 1998.


7) Distribution

Access data tables.


8) Associated researchers and projects:

The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project also has four stations located at the DNERR.  
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data for St. 
Jones and Blackbird watersheds in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water 
quality over time.  The Blackbird component represents a pristine site and the other three represent 
impacted sites.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over roughly two-week collecting 
periods. 

In addition atmospheric deposition of rainfall events is performed in the DNERR watersheds 
to monitor and characterize the nutrient input to the estuary from differing storm events 
and seasonally. One sampler is positioned in the St. Jones watershed and one is in 
the Blackbird watershed.

12) Deleted data:

August: 

The average wind speed, average wind direction and standard wind direction data were deleted from the daily array (144)
on 8/16/04 00:00 (which is the end of day readings for 8/15/04) due to missing hourly wind values on 8/15/2004 2100 in 
array 60. 


The following data loss for all parameters occurred at the time of the new NERR program upload
on November 14, 2003. Values were removed for the following:

ArrayID	CalD	JulianD	Time	
15	14	318	1100	Missing Array 15 data (15 min. data for the following parameters: 
min/max temp & time, min/max relative humidity & time, min/max barometric pressure & time, min/max 
wind speed & time, min/max wind direction& time, wind direction standard deviation, wind speed, and total PAR.   
 
60	14	318	1100	Missing Array 60 (Hourly Averages except total precipitation)
144	15	319	0000	Missing Array 144 (Daily Averages except min wind speed and total 
precipitation)

The following wind speed data were removed. Values are nonsensically high and coincide with the upload 
of the new MET program:

13) Missing data:

August: 

Average wind direction and wind speed data were missing from the hourly (array 60) data for an unknown reason.  
See the Deleted Data section for more information.  


The following error message was generated due to partial monthly data being run through the WDMP due 
to the upload of the new NERR MET program which changed the data format, thus eliminating the use of the WDMP: 

ArrayID	CalD	JulianD	Time	Error Message
150	14	318	915	Missing 150 Array data (15 minute data) from  14 ( 318) 915 to  
30 ( 334) 2400
101	14	318	1000	Missing 101 Array data (Hourly Averages) from  14 ( 318) 1000 to  
30 ( 334) 2400
102	14	318	1000	Missing 102 Array data (Hourly Average Wind Parameters) from  
14 ( 318) 1000 to  30 ( 334) 2300
241	14	318	2400	Missing 241 data (Daily Averages) from  14 ( 318) 2400 to  29 ( 333) 2400
242	14	318	2400	Missing 242 data (Daily Average Wind Parameters) from  14 ( 318) 2400 to  
29 ( 333) 2400
243	14	318	2400	Missing 243 data (Daily Max/Time Values) from  14 ( 318) 2400 to  
29 ( 333) 2400
244	14	318	2400	Missing 244 data (Daily Min/Time Values) from  14 ( 318) 2400 to  
29 ( 333) 2400

The correct information regarding missing data are as follows: Missing 150 array data from November 14, 2004 
(318) 915-1045, 101/102 data from 1000 to 1100, and daily averages. 

December:

Data loss on 12/23/2003 from 09:45-10:00, possibly due to download related error



14) Other Remarks/notes:

a) LiCor: 
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 11/14/2003, all values less than 0 were 
altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect multiplier, calibration problems, 
or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they 
are all valid points.

b) Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 11/14/2003, all values over 100% were altered 
in the raw data to read 100%. These values may indicate an supersaturated air, calibration problems, 
or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they 
are all valid points.
