2. Entry verification:
Data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI and graphs are produced and examined 
using the Ecowatch program software. Data are also uploaded in a comma-delimited 
format from the YSI to the PC. Edited files are created by removing headers, 
footers, and spaces on a PC in Excel 5.0. Suspect data are evaluated using QA/QC 
excel 5.0 macros (version 3.0) from CDMO. Missing data from YSI maintenance are 
inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.). Edited files are 
merged to create one full month of data. Edited and raw data are archived at 
Elkhorn Slough NERR then uploaded to CDMO NERR server. John Haskins is 
responsible for the editing and archiving of data.

3. Research objectives:
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a three to four week period at 
three sites in Elkhorn Slough. One site South Marsh (SM) is in a relatively 
unimpacted side channel of the slough and the second, Azevedo Pond (AP) is in a 
pond that receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from an adjoining strawberry 
field. The third site, North Marsh (NM), was added in April 1999 and is located 
in an area where there is both agricultural and non-agricultural runoff. The 
purpose of this research is to identify the base parameters for Elkhorn Slough 
by using South Marsh as the control site and the other two sites are impacted 
sites and monitored for possible future problems.  

4. Research methods: 
The Elkhorn Slough water-monitoring program began in July 1995. All three sites 
described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI deployment at SM, a 
20-foot length of 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the slough to house the 
YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the pipe's surface area and 
to allow water flow across the YSI. The pipe was positioned vertically in the 
slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom sediments and the other end 
secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) 
above the bottom. This setup is exactly the same at North Marsh.  Prior to YSI 
deployment at AP, a supportive framework of rope and PVC was placed at the site 
to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) above 
the pond bottom. Every half hour over a 30-day period, measurements of specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, depth, turbidity, and pH 
are recorded. 30-day periods were chosen due to the limitations of the dissolved 
oxygen membrane and battery power. At the end of each 30-day period, the YSI is 
brought back into the lab for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Data is 
downloaded on PC and graphs are printed using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde body 
and probes are cleaned.  DO membrane is changed and allowed to re-equilibrate 
for at least eight hours before calibration.  Calibration is performed as 
outlined in the YSI manual.  Buffer solutions of pH 7 and pH 10 are purchased 
from a scientific supply house and used for two-point calibration of the pH 
probe.  A salinity standard of 31.892 ppt was used for calibration of the 
conductivity probe and in the beginning of July 1999 a conductivity standard of 
53 mS/cm was used. The turbidity probe is calibrated using a two-point 
calibration with DI water and 100 NTU standard. As of July 1998 a new YSI is 
calibrated in the lab in order to replace the previous one in the field. This 
eliminates the loss of data due to cleaning and calibration. QA/QC is done 
according to the CDMO manual by John Haskins using the macros provided by the 
CDMO.  Data are then looked over more rigorously to identify and document 
anomalies and missing data.  

5. Site location and character:
Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in Central 
California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay near Moss 
Landing, California. There are three sampling sites.  SM (South Marsh) is in a 
side channel of the slough and is relatively unimpacted by anthropogenic 
influences.  The YSI is located on the side of a bank in one of the secondary 
slough channels.  AP (Azevedo Pond) is in a pond that receives fertilizer and 
pesticide runoff from a strawberry field in year-round production. The YSI is 
located about 10m from a culvert connecting the pond to the slough. NM (North 
Marsh) is located in between South Marsh and Azevedo Pond. This site is impacted 
by both agricultural and urban runoff. The tidal range at Azevedo Pond 
approximately 1.1 m.  Salinity ranges between 3 ppt during storm events to 40 
ppt during warm days with increased evaporation with an average 31 ppt. The 
average salinity for this year was 31 ppt. Temperature ranged from 3 deg to 33 
deg C with an average of 16 deg C. DO% is highly variable ranging from 0 to 328% 
with an average of 80% saturation. PH ranges from 6.9 and 8.7 with an average of 
7.8. Turbidity ranges from 0 to 211 NTU during rain events and has an average of 
11NTU for the year. The tidal range at South Marsh is approximately 2.75 m. 
Salinity ranges from 17 ppt during a storm event to 35 ppt in summer with an 
average of 31 ppt.  Temperature ranged from 9 deg to 23 deg C with an average of 
15 deg C. DO % ranges from 8% to 209% saturation with an average of 86%. PH 
ranges from 7.2 to 8.5 with an average of 7.8. Turbidity ranges from 0 to 98 NTU 
and had an average of 7 NTU. The tidal range of North Marsh is approximately 1 
meter. Salinity ranges between 20 and 43 ppt and has an average of 34 ppt. 
Temperature ranges from 8 deg to 28 deg C and had an average of 18 deg C. DO % 
ranges from 0 to 317% and had an average of 72 % saturation. PH ranged from 6.9 
to 9.1 with an average of 8.0. Turbidity ranged from 0 to 160 NTU with an 
average of 12 NTU. 

6. Data collection period:
Sampling at both sites began simultaneously at the end of June 1995 and data 
collection is ongoing. North Marsh began sampling on April 15 1999.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
The following are brief descriptions of research projects in Elkhorn Slough as 
of June 1998.
	Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough 
Foundation have had an ongoing program to monitor estuarine water quality in the 
central Monterey Bay region since 
1988.  Currently, 24 stations are monitored monthly for temperature, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, nitrate, ammonium and dissolved inorganic 
phosphate concentrations.  Two of these stations on 
the Reserve are about 400 m from the SM site.  Data collection began at these 
two stations in September 1989.  A monthly monitoring station is also located at 
Azevedo Pond within 10 m of the YSI deployment.  Monthly data from the Azevedo 
Pond are available from March 1992.

	The University of California Santa Cruz Agroecology Program has an ongoing 
project to examine the effects of agricultural production on an adjacent 
wetland.  Matthew Werner, Marc Los Huertos, Felecia Rein, Sean Swezey, Mark 
Silberstein, Andrew De Vogelaere, Ron Tjeerdema have been the principal 
investigators.

January 1-31, 1999 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Jan 10 
09:00 due to loss of battery power and the second one began Jan 27 14:30. 
Batteries were depleted prior to recovery; see missing data as to which data 
were missing. All data are suspect Jan 31 23:30 because of sonde being OOW.

South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from one deployment which began Jan 3 16:00. 
The previous deployment ended Dec 31 1998 due to loss of battery power. The 
following are suspect data:
a)	These turbidity data are suspect because they were negative or zero;
Jan 4	11:30-12:30
Jan 5	02:00		06:30		12:30-13:00
Jan 6	02:30		13:00		20:30
Jan 7	03:30		14:00		20:00		21:00
Jan 8	04:00		21:00
Jan 9	22:00
Jan 10	13:30		18:00-18:30
Jan 13	21:00
Jan 16	23:30
Jan 17	10:30
Jan 18	10:00		11:00-11:30
Jan 19	12:00
Jan 22	03:00

Turbidity was suspect because it was anomalously high Jan 05 0700 most likely 
due to debris; datum deleted.
b)	Both temperature and specific conductivity are suspect beginning Jan 18 
08:00 through Jan 30 04:30 due to a sharp increase in temperature and a sharp 
decrease in conductivity. Both readings come back to reasonable readings on Jan 
30 but are still suspect. It is unknown why the probes went suspect possibly due 
to some mud interference. See missing data for those deleted.
c)	% DO and DO mg/L are suspect due to a sharp increase in the readings 
beginning Jan 24 00:30 through the end of the deployment. See missing data for 
those deleted.

February 1-28, 1999 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Feb 26 
15:30 and the second one began Feb 26 16:00. The following are suspect data.
a)	These turbidity data were high and deleted;
Feb 03 1430
Feb 05 1100
Feb 07 0530
Feb 17 1800
Feb 20 1100, 1330, 1430, 1600
	Turbidity data are also suspect beginning Feb 05 1530 through Feb 08 0200 
because of a sharp increase in concentrations on Feb 05 and a sharp decrease Feb 
07 0530. Values were inconsistent and it is suspected a rain event occurred and 
caused higher readings.
b) All data are suspect from Feb 2 00:00 thru Feb 2 08:00 because temperature 
decreases to 4 deg C and depth is irregular indicating probe may have been out 
of water.


South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from three deployments. The first ended Feb 2 
09:30, second one began Feb 2 10:17:50 and ended Feb 24 11:17:50 (all times for 
this deployment were changed up to the nearest half -hour), and the third 
deployment began Feb 24 12:00. The following are the anomalous data for this 
month:
a)	Turbidity was high Feb 6 06:30:00. Data was deleted.
b)	DO % and DO mg/L are suspect from Feb 1 00:00 through Feb 2 09:30 due to 
previously mentioned increase in readings. See missing data for those deleted.

for the month;
a)	Temperature and conductivity had a sharp increase and a sharp decrease on 
April 21 07:30 and remained irregular until April 22 04:30. These are again 
irregular beginning April 29 16:30 through April 30 13:00.  It is not known why 
these data become irregular. See missing data as to those that were deleted.
b)	There are no DO data for this month because probe was not deployed.
c)	All data are missing Apr 21 0700-1630 and Apr 29 1630 through Apr 30 0900 
due to OOW events.

South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended April 9 
18:00 due to loss of battery power and the second one began April 26 19:00 and 
ended April 28 22:00 due to turbidity wiper problem which depleted the 
batteries. 
The following turbidity data are suspect because values were negative or zero:

	Apr 8	03:00
	Apr 9	04:30
Data were not deleted.
Turbidity was suspect April 01 0600 and Apr 28 0200 because they were 
anomalously high probably due to debris and were deleted. 

May 1-31, 1999 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended May 15 
09:00 and the second one began May 15 09:30. DO recorded an unknown very high 
jump in % and mg/L to almost 500% May 10 14:30 and then slowly goes down to 
"normal" highs for Azevedo Pond on May 15. This was due to a membrane puncture; 
data were deleted.  The DO probe again records a high jump to 300% May 26 17:30 
and again slowly goes down to "normal" highs a few days later. It is unknown why 
this jump occurred so data were not deleted.

North Marsh 
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended May 12 
09:30 and the second began May 12 17:30. Batteries were depleted prior to 
recovery; see missing data as to which data were deleted. The following are 
anomalous data for the month:
a)	Temperature data had a sharp increase 
May 3 17:00-21:00
May 6 20:00-21:00
May 7 05:00		07:00
Beginning May 9 02:30 temperature data were irregular for unknown reasons. See 
missing data as to which data were deleted.
b)	Conductivity data had a sharp decrease
May 3 17:00-21:00
May 6 20:30-21:00
May 7 05:00		07:00
Beginning May 9 02:30 conductivity data were also irregular for unknown reasons.  
See missing data as to which data were deleted.
c)	Dissolved oxygen data drop and remain near zero beginning May 22 21:00 
through the end of the deployment May 26 0730. All probes were found covered in 
mud upon recovery and this time was most likely when the DO probe was first 
covered; data was deleted. Data were also negative May 19 22:00 and were 
deleted. 
d)	Turbidity data were erratic beginning May 13 23:00 through May 19 10:00 
were the data remain negative through the rest of the deployment. This was 
probably also due to mud contamination and data were deleted.
e)	All data are missing during these times either because of an OOW event;
May 03 1700-2100
May 06 2000-2100
May 07 0500, 0700

June 20	00:30		06:30		11:30		14:00
Turbidity data was suspect beginning Jun 20 1600 through the end of the month 
because wiper was no longer functioning at the end of the deployment and at this 
time data jumped 50 NTU. This was most likely when the wiper broke. Data was 
deleted.

North Marsh 
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended August 3 
06:30 and the second started August 3 07:00. 
a)	The following are the anomalous data for this month:
Turbidity was negative Aug 13 09:30.  Turbidity data were suspect and deleted 
beginning Aug 23 19:00 through the end of the month due to algae growth over the 
optics.
b)	Depth was suspect beginning Aug 03 0630 because of non-continuous data 
from one deployment to the other. Post deployment calibration for each 
deployment was within acceptable parameters thus data were not deleted.

South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from one deployment that began August 17 08:30 
and lasted through the end of the month.

September 1-30, 1999 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Sept 7 
08:00 and the second one began Sept 7 08:30. Turbidity was suspect Sept 27 1400 
because the value was anomalously high. Data was deleted.

North Marsh 
Data for this month were compiled from three deployments. The first ended Sept 2 
13:30, the second one began Sept 2 14:00 and ended Sept 28 07:00 (battery power 
was depleted Sept 15 17:00), and the third began Sept 28 07:00. The following 
were the anomalous data for this month:
a)	Turbidity data are suspect from the beginning of the month through Sept 15 
1700 due to non-congruous data between deployments. Upon reviewing the 
calibration sheet this was most likely due to a miscalibration for the second 
deployment beginning Sept 02 1400. Data were deleted.
