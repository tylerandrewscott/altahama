2. Entry verification
The data were uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 data loggers and reviewed using 
PC6000 software from YSI.  Graphs were produced and examined using the PC6000 software 
then printed out and filed in order to aid in reviewing data to correlate any anomalous and 
outlying data.  Next, raw data files were uploaded in .dat format and in comma delimited 
format.  The comma delimited files were imported into Microsoft Excel 5.0 as .csv files and 
then saved in .xls format.  Files were then edited to remove extraneous information (headers, 
footers, spaces, and pre- and post-deployment data).  Monthly templates were used to form 
complete sets of monthly data sets.  Macros supplied by NERRS/CDMO were used to help 
with editing, formatting and identifying outliers in the database.  Suspect data (as in data 
believed to result from a damaged or biofouled probe) were evaluated according to Appendix 
B of the CDMO manual, edited and documented. Missing data due to YSI maintenance (down 
time) was inserted into the spreadsheet and was denoted by periods (.).  Data that was not 
within calibration range of the instrument were evaluated and removed from the record and 
denoted by periods (.).  Data that fall outside the normal range of water quality for a site was 
investigated for validity based on QC checks, weather data, field observations, instrument 
diagnostics and PC6000 graphs.  Edited and raw data files were copied and archived in the 
CBNERRVA file server and uploaded to the CDMO FTP site in text format.  All Taskinas 
Creek and Goodwin Islands files from 1997 have been verified using the latest update of the 
Microsoft Excel 5.0 macro programs which identified outliers (values that fall outside of the 
calibration – see section II.8 of this document) and other erroneous data.  Outliers were 
determined according to the instruments and manufacturers manual.  Bill Seufzer collected 
and edited data from 01/97-06/97, during which time Dr. Jeff Shields was the RC for the CBV NERR. 
In July 1997, a new RC was hired, Dr. William Reay, and a new SWMP coordinator, Tammy Dorman, who
collected and edited data from 07/97- 12/97.  Data was processed through the latest update of 
the CDMO macro and conducted final editing of the data.  Both W. Reay and T. Dorman cleaned 
up the data.  Following final editing, Tammy Dorman uploaded the database to the CBNERRVA server
and to CDMO.  

3. Research Objectives
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain rural watershed 
within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This watershed is dominated by forested and 
agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land use component.  The drainage basin is 
suited for investigating hydrologic and nonpoint source water quality issues associated with 
changing land use patterns; these issues are of prime importance to the U.S. EPA Chesapeake 
Bay Program.  Continuously monitored physical water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, 
pH, specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) provide long-term measurements which 
can be supplemented with shorter-term monitoring and process oriented studies.  
Measurements were taken every 15 minutes at the Taskinas Creek site and the YSI 
dataloggers were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at two-week intervals.

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component: 
The Goodwin Islands represent marsh islands surrounded by intertidal flats, submerged aquatic 
vegetation (SAV) beds, oyster reefs, and shallow open estuarine waters.  Because minimal 
human activities occur within upland portions, the Goodwin Islands are suitable as a reference 
or control site for nonpoint source water quality issues.  Furthermore, due to extensive 
wetlands, intertidal, and submerged habitats, the Goodwin Islands are used extensively for 
SAV, material flux, and trophic interaction research activities.  Measurements were taken 
every 15 minutes at the Goodwin Islands site and the YSI dataloggers were maintained, 
downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at two-week intervals.

4.  Research methods 
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a long-term water quality-monitoring 
program, which consists of two stations.  The Taskinas Creek station is located in the 
transitional zone of the York River tributary in the York River State Park.  A simple 
deployment was arranged with the State Park in September 1995, where the secured unit hung 
at a fixed depth (0.5 m above the creek bed) from an overhanging tree approximately six 
meters upstream from the parks canoe landing.  In September 1997, the deployment was 
modified so that the datalogger remained secure at all times within a 4-inch PVC housing 0.5 
m above the bottom.  Three wood pilings were driven into the sediment in an equilateral 
triangle arrangement and the PVC pipe bolted to one piling.  Specific conductivity, pH, 
depth, DO saturation, temperature, and turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity 
and dissolved oxygen are determined from temperature and specific conductivity readings.  At 
approximately two-week intervals, the data logger is returned to the lab for downloading, 
cleaning, membrane replacement and recalibration.  Maintenance intervals are determined 
according to the amount of biofouling that occurs and to accommodate battery life.  A 
second YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed following retrieval of the original YSI datasonde in 
order to maintain a continuous record.  All procedures are in accordance with the YSI 
operating manual methods, sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH, and conductivity were 
purchased from YSI.  Turbidity standards were purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems.  
Beginning in August/September 1997, water samples were taken at the time of datalogger 
deployment and retrieval.  The samples were then taken back to the lab and analyzed for the 
following components:  dissolved oxygen, pH and salinity while temperature was taken in the 
field.  These values were compared to the datalogger readings at the time the water sample 
was taken to identify any discrepancies in the data as well as the sonde's performance. Data 
are reviewed and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix 
B of the CDMO manual.

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a second long-term water quality-
monitoring program at Goodwin Islands, located at the mouth of the York River.  This 
station is located on the southeastern side of the main island in a shallow embayment, 
approximately 400 meters from shore.  A stable and permanent structure was built in October 
1997 where 4-inch PVC pipe is housed inside of a commercially available galvanized steel 
communications tower with the datalogger 0.5 m from the bottom.  Specific conductivity, 
pH, depth, DO saturation, temperature, and turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals.  
Salinity and dissolved oxygen are determined from temperature and specific conductivity 
readings.  At approximately two-week intervals, the datalogger is returned to the lab for 
downloading, cleaning, membrane replacement and recalibration.  Maintenance intervals are 
determined according to the amount of biofouling that occurs and to accommodate battery 
life.  A second YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed following retrieval of the original YSI 
datasonde in order to maintain a continuous record.  All procedures are in accordance with 
the YSI operating manual methods, sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH, and conductivity 
were purchased from YSI. Turbidity standards were purchased from Advanced Polymer 
Systems.  Beginning in August/September 1997, water samples were taken at the time of 
datalogger deployment and retrieval.  The samples were then taken back to the lab and 
analyzed for the following components:  dissolved oxygen, pH and salinity while temperature 
was taken in the field.  These values were compared to the datalogger readings at the time the 
water sample was taken to identify any discrepancies in the data as well as the sonde's 
performance. Data are reviewed and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing 
Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO manual.

5.  Site location and character
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component: (37 deg 24' 54.04617"; 76 deg 42' 51.75733")
The Taskinas Creek Component of the CBNERR-VA is on the south shore of the York River 
in James City County near Williamsburg.  The site is approximately 44 kilometers upstream 
from the river's mouth and 15 kilometers downstream from West Point.  Headwaters of 
Taskinas Creek are near the town of Croaker, which is located 10 kilometers north of 
Williamsburg.  Fed by numerous perennial streams, Taskinas Creek is approximately 3 
kilometers in length and flows in a northeasterly direction eventually emptying into the 
York River.  Tidal range within the creek is 0.0-1.3 m.   The sampling station is located on 
the second bend from the mouth of Taskinas Creek within the York River State Park, about 
6 meters upstream from the park’s canoe landing.  The sediment type at this station consists 
of approximately 42% fine sand, 30% clay, and 28% silt.  The non-tidal portion contains 
feeder streams, which drain oak-hickory forests, maple-gum-oak-ash swamps and freshwater 
marshes.  The marshes near the creek mouth are brackish with a salinity range from 3-13 
ppt.  The shoreline is moderately low with fringing marsh and tidal flats.  Taskinas Creek 
mainly drains the undeveloped York River State Park watershed, however the watershed is 
lightly impacted above the State Park by residential development and selective hardwood 
logging.  Wildlife populations have been shown to influence microbiological water quality 
within the watershed.
 
Goodwin Islands (GI) Component: (37 deg 13' 02.65093"; 76 deg 23' 32.75799")

The Goodwin Islands component of the CBNERR-VA is on the mouth of the York River at 
the northeastern tip of York County.  This site is approximately 22 kilometers downstream 
from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. Circulation patterns at the Goodwin Islands are 
influenced by York River discharge and the wind patterns of the Chesapeake Bay.  The 
sampling station is located in a shallow embayment on the southeastern side of the main 
island amongst submerged aquatic vegetation beds dominated by Zostera marina.  The 
Goodwin Islands represents a pristine, well-flushed polyhaline system with salinity ranges 
from 13-24 ppt and tidal ranges from 0.5-1.0 m.  Spartina alterniflora dominates the low 
marsh, which covers 70% of the emergent marsh area.  Estuarine scrub/shrub vegetation 
dominates the forested ridges, with the dominant shrub Myrica cerifera (wax myrtle).  The 
Goodwin Islands are undeveloped and only accessible by boat.  This site is used extensively by 
VIMS for SAV research. 

6.  Data collection period:
Ongoing sampling at Taskinas Creek (TC) began September 1995.  Ongoing sampling at 
Goodwin Islands (GI) began mid-October 1997.

7.  Associated researchers and projects:

A volunteer water quality monitoring program sponsored by the Alliance for the Chesapeake 
Bay has been ongoing at Taskinas Creek for several years, beginning January 10, 1990.  This project samples some 
overlapping parameters including dissolved oxygen and salinity on a two-week basis.

9. Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions 

Site definitions: TC = Taskinas Creek, GI= Goodwin Islands 
File definitions: YSI deployment site/month/year (ex.: TC0997 = Taskinas Creek data from 
September 1997). 

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data):
Frequent data anomalies were recorded in depth levels for several months potentially due to 
low-pressure weather fronts.  This data remained in the database.  According to the CDMO 
Operations Manual Version 3.0, depth measurements taken with the non-vented level probe 
can be influenced by up to 0.39 m (1.3 ft) during some low-pressure hurricane events.  
Specific dates and time ranges of potentially influenced data are listed with each respective 
month.

post- okay
03/08/97 02:00:00 to 03/09/97 00:15:00	DO values plummet but recover; pre- and 
post- values okay
03/10/97 14:30:00 to 03/11/97 17:30:00	DO mg/L values incorrect due to incorrect 
spcond values; data deleted
03/10/97 14:30:00 to 03/31/97 23:45:00	Salinity/Spcond too high for site; could have 
been a calibration error or probe malfunction; data deleted
03/11/97 17:45:00 to 03/31/97 23:45:00	DO membrane puncture early in study; data 
deleted

Note:  YSI told us that only the DO mg/L values were affected by the incorrect spcond 
calibration.  DO % saturation should be correct since it is not calculated from conductivity 
values.

03/01/97 00:00:00 to 03/31/97 23:45:00	No turbidity probe deployed
03/10/97 14:15:00			Maintenance
03/10/97 14:30:00 to 03/11/97 17:30:00	DO mg/L values incorrect due to incorrect 
spcond values; data deleted 
03/10/97 14:30:00 to 03/31/97 23:45:00	Salinity/Spcond too high for site, could have 
been a calibration error or probe malfunction; data deleted
03/11/97 17:45:00 to 03/31/97 23:45:00	DO membrane puncture early in study; data 
deleted

Note:  YSI told us that only the DO mg/L values were affected by the incorrect spcond 
calibration.  DO % saturation should be correct since it is not calculated from conductivity 
values.

12. Remarks
Any regions of data with negative depth values due to low tides or low-pressure systems 
should be viewed with caution.  In some instances the probes are clearly out of water and have 
been noted.  Depth data should be considered relative depth.  From September 1995 to 
September 1997 at Taskinas Creek, the instruments were deployed on a rope that was tied to 
a tree branch, during which the instrument may have been deployed at a slightly different 
depth for each deployment.  In September 1997 at Taskinas Creek, a permanent structure 
was placed inside of 4-inch PVC housing at a fixed depth from the bottom.  Problems with 
exposure from low tides and currents have been resolved.  In October 1997, a permanent 
structure was also installed at the Goodwin Islands where the datalogger is deployed inside 4-
inch PVC pipe at a fixed depth from the bottom. 

Please note that in December of 1997, construction work began and is ongoing at the York 
River State Park in an effort to reduce erosion problems from the steep banks into the creek.  
This may be effecting the Taskinas Creek deployment readings, especially for turbidity.  All 
construction work is taking place about 75 feet upstream from the deployment site.  

The time clock in the dataloggers was off during the following times: 

November 1997:
TC:
11/11/97 16:01:33 to 11/21/97 10:16:33	Time clock was off +1min 33sec; was 
corrected.

November 1997:
GI:
11/04/97 13:35:33 to 11/18/97 09:05:33	Time clock was off +5 min 33 sec; was 
corrected.
