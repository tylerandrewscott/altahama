2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6600 into the EcoWatch (version 
3.15) software, plotted, and initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing 
data. YSI raw data files are then downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) 
and imported into Microsoft Excel as a comma-space delimited file (.csv). These 
raw data files are then organized into standardized monthly data sets using the 
CDMO import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, 
import the raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters 
for depth readings if necessary, and save the monthly files as either a .csv or 
.xls file.  Once in monthly format, these files are then run through the 
cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which identify outliers, insure the correct number of 
data points for each Date/Hour count, and format the columns to the correct 
order and size. The monthly files are then carefully edited by staff for data 
anomalies which are identified in Section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this document. 
Any data that are deleted by staff are replaced with periods and identified in 
Section 12 (Deleted Data). Monthly edited files are then FTP'd to CDMO in text format, along 
with an updated metadata form. Periods were later removed for data dissemination 
purposes and left blank. Jessica Stewart is responsible for all the QA/QC 
process.

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the 
Tate's Hell Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage 
period and allowed increased runoff with a concomitant increase in pH, which had 
a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  Because of this 
some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was done. 
The Northwest Florida Water Management District purchased a large section, 
approximately 36,000 acres, in 1994.  An EPA grant allowed them to begin 
restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning 
the dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay allows the Reserve to 
monitor changes in water quality during this restoration effort. Cat Point and 
Dry Bar stations collect water quality data associated with the health of 
oysters. These stations are located on two of the most productive oyster beds in 
the bay. They were chosen as sites so that the health of these economically 
important oyster bars could be monitored continuously. 

4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the 
NERRS System Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) effort.  Apalachicola NERR began monitoring 
three stations in the Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, using 
Hydrolab Datasonde 3's. These stations continue to be monitored today using YSI 
6600's and YSI 6600 EDS model sondes.  The East Bay station consists of two 
sites, including a sonde placed near the surface at this site and one located 
near the bottom sediment. Cat Point and Dry Bar are the other two stations 
located near two of the most productive oyster beds in Apalachicola Bay.  Both 
Hydrolab and YSI dataloggers have been used at all stations interchangeably as 
required, however only YSI 6600/6600 EDS models were used to collect data in 
2003.   Prior to deployment, YSI 6600's and YSI 6600 EDS's are calibrated for 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, turbidity and pH following the 
procedures outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual (with addendum 
5/99). Lab grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) are initially used to 
calibrate the YSI's, which are then used to check working standards made up and 
used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab grade standards are also used 
periodically to check the accuracy of the working salinity standards.  

The only variation from the manual is the use of two pH standards for two-point 
calibration of pH rather than three-point calibration.  The membranes for the 
dissolved oxygen probe are installed at least 12 hours prior to calibration.  
Depth is set to 0.0 meters in the lab. A turbidity probe was added to the YSI 
6000's in December 1996. The model 6026 turbidity probe has been offered by YSI 
since 1995, but as of 2003 is no longer in use.  The Reserve began using the new 
turbidity probe (6136) in March 2002. These probes are calibrated using a lab 
grade, (YSI) 123 NTU standard and deionized water (0 NTU).  Following 
calibration, a guard is attached to the datalogger to protect the probes. A 
piece of plastic mesh is placed in the bottom of the guard and then attached to 
the outside of the guard to discourage any creatures from getting to the probes 
and to minimize fouling. The sondes are then programmed to begin recording data 
early in the morning prior to deployment. They are placed in a 5-gallon bucket 
with some water to sit overnight.  The D.O. probe is re-calibrated before 
deployment and the sonde is checked to insure that the instrument is working 
properly. 

In 2001, the task of wrapping the sonde in a wet, white towel during 
transportation for deployment and retrieval became a part of the standardized 
procedure for YSI 6-series multi-parameter sondes. In 2003, this method still 
proves to be an effective method of transporting. During deployment and 
retrieval of the sondes, measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations and 
percent saturation, as well as salinity and temperature, are taken at the sites 
using a hand-held YSI meter. 

YSI 6600 and YSI 6600 EDS dataloggers are deployed on the same piling within a 
five inch diameter stainless-steel tube with a locking cap. In order to maintain 
constant depth, the dataloggers are clamped to a pvc pipe and lowered into the 
tube, relinquishing the need for diving.  Large holes were cut in the tube where 
the probes are located to insure adequate circulation.  Every two weeks the 
dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected.  Freshly 
calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data 
gaps in the 30-minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the 
northwestern part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located 
adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola 
Bay system, including 52 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both 
natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  

East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a causeway and is 
located to the north of the bay proper.  East bay is 8.2 km long, has an average 
depth of approximately 1.0 m MHW, and an average width of 1.8 km. The tides in 
East Bay are mixed and range from 0.3 m to 1.0 m (average 0.5 m). The sampling 
site is located in the upper reaches of East Bay.  The piling location is 
latitude 29° 47.15' N and longitude 84° 52.52' W. At the sampling site, the 
depth is 2.2 m MHW and the width of the bay is 1 km.  The tides in the system 
are mixed, meaning the number of tides can range from one to five tides during a 
24-hour period and are not evenly distributed throughout the day.  

At the East Bay bottom site the meter probes are 0.3 m above the bottom 
sediment. Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt and the long-term average salinity is 
approximately 8 ppt.  At the East Bay surface site the meter probes are 1.7 m 
above the bottom sediment and salinity ranges from 0 ppt to 30 ppt with a long 
term average salinity of 6.3 ppt.  The freshwater input is very tanic and 
usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are not quantified due 
to the diverse sources of the runoff. The bottom habitat at this bay site is 
soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with no vegetation present. The 
dominant marsh vegetation near the sampling site is Juncus roemerianus and 
Cladium jamaicense.  The dominant upland vegetation is primarily pineland 
forest, which includes slash pine, saw palmetto, and sand pine.  Upland land use 
near the sampling site includes conservation and silviculture uses with some 
single family residential in the lower East Bay area.  The sampling site is 
influenced local runoff from Tate's Hell Swamp, the East Bay marshes, and 
distributary flow, some of which comes from the Apalachicola River via the East 
River.  Tate's Hell Swamp was ditched, diked, and altered back in the late 
1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  These changes shortened the 
drainage period and allowed increased runoff with a concomitant decrease in pH 
and increase in color, which had a drastic affect on the biological communities 
in East Bay.  Restoration of Tate's Hell Swamp began in 1995 to reduce non-point 
source runoff. 

The Cat Point sampling site is located in St. George Sound, approximately 400 
meters east of the St. George Island Bridge. The piling location is latitude 29° 
42.12' N and longitude 84° 52.81' W.  The tides at Cat Point are mixed and range 
from 0.3m to 1.0m (average 0.5m). At the sampling site, the depth is 2 to 3 m 
MHW. (The site was moved approximately 600 meters south in October 1997) and the 
width of the bay is 4 miles. At the Cat Point site the meter probes are 0.3 
meters above the bottom sediment. Salinity ranges from 0 to 32 ppt. Flows vary 
with local rainfall and are not quantified due to the diverse sources of the 
runoff. The bottom type is oyster bar with no vegetation present except algae 
growing on the oysters in the summer. The dominant upland vegetation is 
primarily pineland forest, which includes slash pine, saw palmetto, and sand 
pine. Upland land use near the sampling site, includes, single family 
residential and commercial use in the Eastpoint area. The sampling site is 
influenced by local runoff from Tate's Hell Swamp and flow from the Apalachicola 
River, which has the highest flow rate in Florida. High salinity water comes 
mainly from the east, through East Pass at the end of St. George Island. 

The Dry Bar sampling site is located near St. Vincent Sound, in the western part 
of the Apalachicola Bay system, approximately one-half mile east of St. Vincent 
Island. The piling location is latitude 29° 40.48' N and longitude 85° 3.50' W. 
At the sampling site, the depth is 2 meters and the width of the bay is 7 miles. 
At the Dry Bar site the meter probes are located 0.3 meters above the bottom 
sediment. The tides are mixed and range from 0.3 to 1.0 meters. Salinity ranges 
from 0 to 34 ppt. The bottom type is oyster bar with no vegetation present, 
except algae that grow on the oysters during the summer months. The dominant 
upland vegetation includes, slash pine flatwoods with various combinations of 
gallberry, smooth cordgrass, fetterbush, cabbage palm, saw palmetto, magnolia, 
and grasses. Upland use near the sampling site includes state owned and managed 
Cape St. George Island and St. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge, as well as, 
single family residential and commercial use in the Apalachicola area. The 
sampling site is influenced from the flow of the Apalachicola River, which is 
monitored daily, and high salinity water entering West Pass and Sikes Cut via 
tidal action.

6. Data collection period:
The dataloggers were first deployed at the East Bay Surface site on April 17, 
1995.  East Bay bottom sampling began on May 1, 1995. Both have been 
continuously in service since then. Data from the two oyster bar stations, Cat 
Point and Dry Bar, has been collected since 1992, although this is only the 
second year that the data from these stations will be submitted to the CDMO as 
SWMP stations. During the year 2003, all deployments utilized YSI dataloggers. 
Deployment dates and times for 2003 follows.

8. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been monitoring water quality at three stations in Apalachicola Bay 
since May of 1992, with the use of Hydrolab Datasondes and YSI 6-series model 
sondes. One of these stations was moved from the mid-bay area near the 
Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site in January of 1993.  The other 
two are located on two of the largest commercially important oyster bars in the 
bay.  These stations, like East Bay, are intended to be long-term. Other 
associated researchers and projects, which have, or continue to utilize this 
water quality data are:

12. Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, battery failure, 
maintenance/calibration of equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or 
elimination of data due to calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more 
details on deleted data, see the Anomalous Data Section (11.). to find out more 
details about missing data, contact the Research Coordinator at the site 
submitting the data.

14. Other remarks/notes:
Tropical Storm Bill passed over the Apalachicola Bay area on June 30, 2003.

There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded small 
negative values (-0001, -0002, -0003, and -0004). Because turbidity has a range 
of accuracy of +/-2 NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted these values in 
any way.
