I. Data Set & Research Descriptors

1) Principal investigator & contact persons:

Richard Langan, Ph.D. Co-Director of CICEET and Research Scientist, 
Jackson Estuarine Laboratory, email: rlangan@cisunix.unh.edu 
Jaimie Wolf, Research Technician, email: jswolf@cisunix.unh.edu 

2) Entry verification 
After the data is downloaded from the weather station, it is imported into the SWMP 
Weather Data Management Program. The data is QA/QC'd by the WDMP which generates 
an error report. The erroneous data are then examined and corrected or deleted using 
Microsoft Access. After the monthly file has been corrected in Access, it is recompiled 
in WDMP.


a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each instrument 
on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger 
Program (nerr.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  
The weather station is permanently connected to a Dell computer in the lab. The data were 
downloaded twice monthly to the PC.  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W 
software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  

The following are common errors that occur in the data sets.  Values are flagged by the 
WDMP program if, wind speed falls below the 0.5 m/s criteria, or a temperature change of 
greater than 3 C in a 15-minute period or a precipitation difference of greater than 5mm 
in 15 minutes occurs.

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of 
the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and Access Database.  
There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited 
monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces 
error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in 
Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data 
Correction section below.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time.		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data at the Great Bay 
Estuary in order to aid with the interpretation of changes in water quality.

4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and 
daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric 
pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken 
every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150.   A two-week sampling interval was 
chosen so that the CR10X datalogger would not run out of memory and overwrite data. 
Periodically, sensors on the weatherstation are inspected for damage or debris.  If any 
is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned. Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell 
Scientific for calibration at minimum of every two years. 

5) Site location and character:

The GBNERR weather station is located on the roof of the University of New Hampshire's 
Jackson Estuarine Laboratory.  The lab is located on the shore of the Great Bay Estuary 
at Adams Point, which divides the Little Bay and Great Bay portions of the Estuary.   The 
latitude and longitude are as follows: N 43º 08.063  W 070º 54.576
Approximate distance of the weather station are as follows:
From the 
	Great Bay sonde: 1 mile
	Squamscott River sonde: 2 miles
	Lamprey River sonde: 2.5 miles
	Oyster River sonde: 4 miles
	Portsmouth Harbor sonde: 6 miles

The rooftop at Jackson lab is approximately 30 ft above ground and approximately 45 ft 
above mean high water.  The roof is tar with embedded light colored stones which provides 
a generally reflective surface that does not absorb and radiate excessive heat.  The 
CR10X datalogger, air temperature and relative humidity sensors are attached to the lower 
portion a three-meter tower mounted on the roof.  The rain gauge is affixed to a gable 
that rises approximately 3' above the roof line.  The light sensor and wind speed and 
direction sensors are attached at either end of a "T " mounted on top of the tower.  
There is minimal blocking and shading due to the mounting height of the instruments.  


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected at the Great Bay site since April 1997.
This metadata document covers the period of time from July 10, 2001 to December 31, 2001.

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The weather data is used by a number of University and State agency scientists conducting 
biological, physical and chemical projects in the estuarine and near shore environments.  
The data is used by the SWMP program to assist in the interpretation of short and long 
term changes in water column conditions.  Some general examples include 1) using rainfall 
data to understand changes in salinity, 2) using wind speed and direction to understand 
changes in turbidity and 3) using PAR data to understand changes in fluorescence and 
chlorophyll a concentrations.

The following data was retained: 
Air temp difference from 12 ( 193) 1215 ( 21.495) to 12 ( 193) 1230 ( 16.871) is greater 
than 3.0 degrees C
Air temp difference from 31 ( 212) 1515 ( 29.366) to 31 ( 212) 1530 ( 25.885) is greater 
than 3.0 degrees C
Air temp difference from 31 ( 212) 1530 ( 25.885) to 31 ( 212) 1545 ( 22) is greater than 
3.0 degrees C
Rel hum difference from 31 ( 212) 1530 ( 47.328) to 31 ( 212) 1545 ( 73.009) is greater 
than 25%

Barometric pressure data was erroneous (less than 700) due to probe malfunction from July 
10 1215 to July 31 2400.  The probe was returned for repair.  This data was deleted and 
replaced with 55555's:  
Technician changed 150 Array data at  10 ( 191) 1215 to  31 ( 212) 2400
Technician changed 101 Array data at  10 ( 191) 1300 to  31 ( 212) 2400

Technician changed 243 Array data at  10 ( 191) 2400 to  31 ( 212) 2400
Technician changed 244 Array data at  10 ( 191) 2400 to  31 ( 212) 2400

Hourly data (101, 102) was recorded on 7/10 1100 in-between times when the station was 
being powered on and off, therefore the following data was deleted and replaced with 
55555's: 
Technician changed 101 Array data from 10 ( 191) 1100 to  10 ( 191) 1100

15 minute wind direction data (150) at 8/24 1530, 8/25 0445 and 8/27 2200 were slightly 
negative (-.095) due to stray voltage that is recorded in the deadband zone of the wind 
sensor (355-359).  15 minute data was converted to zero (0) for these times.  

15 minute wind direction data (array 150) from 8/28 1315, 8/28 1630 and 8/28 1700 and 
8/29 0915 – 1845 was deleted and replaced with 55555's because the probe registered very 
large negative numbers (anywhere from –1.4 to –83) due to probe malfunction.  Due to 
these large negative values, the hourly and daily wind direction data (102, 242) for the 
day have been deleted and replaced with 55555's:  
Technician changed 102 Array from 28 ( 240) 1400

15 minute wind direction data (150) at 12/8 1245, 12/9 915, and 12/16 915 were slightly 
negative (-.095) due to stray voltage that is recorded in the deadband zone of the wind 
sensor (355-359).  15 minute data was converted to zero (0) for these times.  


12) Missing data:

July 2001
No data was collected from July 1 0000 to July 10 1200 because probes were out for 
calibration.  Therefore, no 15 minute (150), hourly averages (101, 102), daily averages 
(241, 242) or daily max and min data (243, 244) were collected (see anomalous data 
section for more information):  
Missing 150 Array data (15 minute data) from  1 ( 182) 15 to  10 ( 191) 1200
Missing 101 Array data (Hourly Averages) from  1 ( 182) 100 to  10 ( 191) 1000
Missing 102 Array data (Hourly Average Wind Parameters) from  1 ( 182) 100 to  10 ( 191) 
1000
Missing 241 data (Daily Averages) from  1 ( 182) 2400 to  9 ( 190) 2400
Missing 242 data (Daily Average Wind Parameters) from  1 ( 182) 2400 to  9 ( 190) 2400
Missing 243 data (Daily Max/Time Values) from  1 ( 182) 2400 to  9 ( 190) 2400
Missing 244 data (Daily Min/Time Values) from  1 ( 182) 2400 to  9 ( 190) 2400


August 2001
No rainfall data collected for August due to malfunctioning rain gauge which was returned 
for repair and calibration.  Therefore, no 15 minute precipitation totals (151), hourly 
precipitation totals (106) or daily precipitation totals (246) were collected.  


December 2001
No data from 12/3 1400 to 12/7 2000. Datalogger failed to record for this 4 day period:
Missing 150 Array data (15 minute data) from  3 ( 337) 1400 to  7 ( 341) 2000
Missing 101 Array data (Hourly Averages) from  3 ( 337) 1400 to  7 ( 341) 1900
Missing 102 Array data (Hourly Average Wind Parameters) from  3 ( 337) 1400 to  7 ( 341) 
1900
Missing 241 data (Daily Averages) from  3 ( 337) 2400 to  6 ( 340) 2400
Missing 242 data (Daily Average Wind Parameters) from  3 ( 337) 2400 to  6 ( 340) 2400
Missing 243 data (Daily Max/Time Values) from  3 ( 337) 2400 to  6 ( 340) 2400


13) Other Remarks/notes

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

Slightly negative wind directions (-.095) typically are a result of stray voltage that is 
recorded in the 4 degree deadband zone of the wind direction sensor (355-359).
