2.	Entry verification:
The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 sonde to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat). The comma-delimited files are 
imported into Excel 97 where they are formatted and processed by macros that are 
supplied by the CDMO.  Various macros are designed to: 1) check data files for 
missing data points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods 
(.), 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and 
numeric variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the 
sensors and out the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) save the 
files as Excel worksheets (*.xls).  The anomalous data are evaluated to 
determine whether to flag or delete the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the 
values are: 1) outside the range expected for the site (see Site Location 
and Character section), 2) outside the range of measurements and accuracy 
established for the sensors (see Variable Sequence, Range of Measurements, 
Units, Resolution, and Accuracy section), or 3) outside the range established 
for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen <28%).  Data are 
deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor malfunction, 2) exposure 
of sensors during low tide, or 3) fouling of sensors by aquatic organisms, 
debris, or sediment.  Sensor malfunctions are detected if the voltage reading of 
the sensor is outside the range established for the sensor or the sensor will 
not calibrate.  Fouling of sensors is detected by comparing in-situ sensor 
readings with measurements (see Research Methods section).  In addition, sensor 
readings that differ significantly (>10%) from standard solution (i.e., 
conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during deployment.  After 
corrections are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the files are exported as 
tab-delimited files  (*.txt) to the CDMO.  Christopher Graffeo, Mark Thompson, 
and Saundra Upchurch are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:

Based on discussions with local CZM personnel and our knowledge of land use 
within the Reserve, the South Edisto River drainage basin appears well suited 
for studying contrasting hydrographic conditions and land use patterns. One NERR 
water quality monitoring station has been established near Edisto Beach within a 
tributary of Big Bay Creek.  Surrounded by residential and commercial 
development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is designated 
as the "treatment" site.  The second NERR water quality monitoring station has 
been situated near Bailey Island, within a tributary of St. Pierre Creek.  Urban 
development in the immediate area of this station has been sparse to date so 
this station will serve as our "control" site.  The ACE Basin water quality 
monitoring program began on March 3, 1995 at two tributaries off Big Bay and St. 
Pierre creeks (see Site Location and Character section for description of 
sites).  YSI electronic data loggers were deployed to measure the water 
temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity 
conditions, approximately 0.1 meters above the creek bottom, at 30-minute 
intervals. Change in water level was also recorded. 

4.	Research Methods
 One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in the South 
Edisto River watershed.  The monitoring station at Big Bay Creek was constructed 
in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted vertically on 12-foot galvanized 
pole.  To facilitate water flow across the sensors, approximately two-inch 
diameter holes are drilled into the PVC pipes.  The pipes are also positioned to 
ensure that the sensors are approximately 0.1 meters from the creek bottom.  In 
1997, the St. Pierre Creek station was modified: the PVC pipe is now mounted 
horizontally in a pyramid-shaped cage (2.5 ft long by 1.5 ft high) tethered to 
the original 12-foot galvanized pole.  Later that year, we began to put the data 
loggers in 1/8-inch mesh net bags before placing them in the PVC pipe to reduce 
damage by crabs and fish.  During the summer, the data loggers are left at the 
sites for one week, and the sampling period is extended to one month during the 
cooler months.  At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are brought 
back to the laboratory for cleaning, calibration, and servicing, by methods 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  Downtime for doing these 
procedures normally ranges from 24 to 48 hours.  After cleaning the data 
loggers, the pH, conductivity, depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated, 
using the following standards: pH 7 and 10, conductivity standard of 58.64mS/cm, 
depth in the air, and turbidity standards of 0 and 100 NTU, respectively.  The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and is allowed to stretch for 24 
hours before the DO sensor is calibrated in air-saturated water.  In addition to 
the procedures outlined in the manual, we conduct a DO membrane integrity test 
to determine if the membrane was punctured during deployment. 

Several quality assurance checks are used to determine if the sensor readings 
drifted significantly during deployment. In-situ measurements of dissolved 
oxygen, expressed in mg/L, salinity, and water temperature are taken during the 
first and last sampling interval.  Water samples are collected at the same depth 
as the sensors.  Water temperature and salinity are measured directly with a 
thermistor and refractometer, respectively, and dissolved oxygen level is 
determined by the Winkler procedure.  Post-deployment measurements of all the 
parameters are taken before cleaning the data loggers.  Sensors are immersed in 
the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., pH) and readings are recorded.  The 
results of these checks are used to evaluate the validity of the data (see Entry 
Verification section). 

5.	Site Location and Character:
The two sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South Edisto River.  
The descriptions of the sites are as follows:
Station A--this site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32 29 38.72125N and 80 19 21.69864W).  Surrounded by residential 
and commercial development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this 
station is designated as the "treatment" site. Pollution sources include houses 
bordering the creek, many of them with little setbacks from the bordering 
Spartina marsh; forty docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and 
Wolmanized pilings; boat dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a 
paved road and three boat ramps off the creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA 
treated bulkheads and fueling areas located about 0.5 miles downstream; two 
commercial seafood docks with 8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three 
restaurants.  The creek is closed to shellfish harvesting because of the human 
development in the vicinity. Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh 
dominated by Spartina alterniflora with isolated areas of Salicornia.  Upland 
fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oak and cedars. Reefs of American 
oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fringe the creek banks.  At the time of 
reconnaissance, depth of the creek midway through ebb tide was 5 feet and 
salinity was 23 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station B--this site is in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (GPS coordinates: 
32 31 40.59518N and 80 21 41.25481W). It is surrounded by a wide expanse of 
Spartina alterniflora marsh.  Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs fringe the 
banks.  Maritime forest communities comprised of species such as wax myrtles, 
live oaks, and palmettos dominate the upland areas.  Development in the 
immediate area is sparse.  This creek is subject to relatively light boat 
traffic.  At the time of reconnaissance, depth at low tide was 2.5 feet and 
salinity was 21 ppt. 

The following discussions of trends in water quality at the monitoring stations 
are based on data collected from March 1995 through December 1997.  During this 
period, water temperature at both monitoring sites exhibited a seasonal pattern 
with lowest values occurring in December-January.  The lowest monthly water 
temperature observed was 8.9 oC, which occurred in February 1996 at St. Pierre 
Creek. Temperature maxima occurred in July and August with the highest monthly 
water temperature (38.9 oC) occurring in July 1995 at Big Bay Creek.  Diurnal 
variation in temperature was evident with warmest temperatures occurring from 
1300 hr to 1800 hr at both sites.  Salinity also exhibited seasonal variability 
during the same period, with lowest values occurring in March at Big Bay and St. 
Pierre creeks.  Another period of low average monthly salinity occurred at Big 
Bay Creek in December 1997.  Average annual salinity for both sites was in the 
polyhaline regime, with a mean of 29.4 ppt at Big Bay Creek and 26.3 ppt at St. 
Pierre Creek; however, for all years, salinity ranged from 0.3-41.7 ppt at Big 
Bay and from 0-41.7 ppt at St. Pierre Creek.  Local precipitation and 
evaporation conditions are most likely the major contributors to monthly 
variability in salinity.  Analysis of the data indicates that tidal stage 
strongly influences salinity.  As expected, highest values of salinity occurred 
on the flood tide. 

It appears that tidal stage also influences pH. Spectral analysis revealed a 
periodicity for pH and water depth with a sinusoidal period at ~ 12 hrs, 
representing tidal periodicity.  Time series plots of pH indicated variability 
of ~1 standard unit (su) on a daily basis. The pH at both sites was very 
similar, ranging from 5.3-8.4; however, the preponderance of measurements were 
>7 at both sites.  The pH observed at the two monitoring sites appears to be 
attributable to natural conditions.  Marked variations in pH can also occur 
diurnally due to changes in primary production and respiration.  Dissolved 
oxygen concentrations appear to track depth for part of the cycle, with lowest 
values occurring on low tides.  Afternoon and evening values were not as low as 
early morning values, suggesting a diurnal component.  Dissolved oxygen values 
at the two monitoring sites were generally high throughout the year with 
averages of 83.6% saturation and 6.6 mg/l for Big Bay Creek and 78.5% saturation 
and 6.3 mg/l for St. Pierre Creek, with highest values in winter and lowest in 
summer.  Hypoxic events (<28% air saturation) were observed in every season but 
summer was clearly the season with the greatest percent of time that DO was > 
28%.  Whereas, supersaturation (>100% air saturation) occurred primarily in the 
winter, with values exceeding 120% at both creeks.  There are a few differences 
among the sites such as, hypoxic conditions occur more frequently at St. Pierre 
Creek.  Unlike the other parameters monitored at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks, 
there appears to be no distinct seasonal trend in turbidity; however, monthly 
variability appeared greater at the St. Pierre site.  This may be due to 
fluctuations in the amount of detritus being washed form the extensive salt 
marsh and upland sites that surround St. Pierre Creek.

7.	Associated researchers and projects:
In 1993, the Reserve staff initiated a long-term survey of the decapod 
crustaceans and juvenile fish that utilize the estuarine waters of the Reserve 
as a nursery ground.  There are four sampling stations in each of the three 
major rivers (Ashepoo, Combahee and South Edisto) of the Reserve.  Stations are 
located along a salinity gradient, ranging from polyhaline to oligohaline or 
limnetic.  Sampling is done each month during daylight flood tide.  Trawls are 
10 minutes long and tows are made against the tide.  Several physical parameters 
are measured at each station: air and water temperature, salinity, wind speed 
and direction, water depth and tidal stage.  Cloud cover and rainfall conditions 
are also recorded at each station.  To date, we have caught seventy-one species 
of fish and twenty-eight species of decapod crustacean species.Drs. Geoff Scott 
and Tom Mathews are assessing the distribution of contaminants (i.e., trace 
metals, PAHs, pesticides) in sediments within the rivers of the Reserve.  
Surface sediment grabs were collected from twelve sites in the Reserve.  Ten 
sites are located along a salinity gradient in Ashepoo, Combahee and South 
Edisto rivers, and two sites are located in the vicinity of our data logger 
sites.  Surface sediment grabs were collected in 1996 from each site, and the 
samples will be analyzed for trace metals (i.e., Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and 
Zn), PAHs and pesticides.

St. Pierre
a)	The following records include pH readings that are higher than observed at 
this site (pH 5.3-8.4). However, the data were not deleted because the pH 
calibration held through the December 21, 1998-January 20, 1999 deployment.  The 
cause of the high readings is not known at this time.

b)	During the following periods, temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and turbidity data were deleted because the 
sensors were fouled by mud from nearby creek bank.
01/02/99	12:00:00	THRU	01/20/99    11:00:00
c)	During the following periods, pH data were deleted because the sensor 
malfunctioned during the deployment.
01/22/99	09:30:00	THRU	01/31/99    23:30:00
d)	The following records include salinity readings that are less than 18 ppt.  
These readings are not within normal mesohaline/polyhaline salinity range (18 
and 35 ppt) for this site.  The heavy rainfall events may have caused the low 
salinity conditions.
01/24/99	06:00:00-07:00:00

February 1-28, 1999 Sampling Period
Big Bay

a)	During the following periods, turbidity data were deleted because the 
wiper malfunctioned during the December 21, 1998-January 20, 1999 deployment.  A 
new unit (datalogger and sensors) was deployed at the next deployment.
02/01/99	00:00:00	THRU	02/10/99    10:00:00
b)	During the following periods, dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted 
because the DO membrane was punctured during deployment.
02/03/99	03:00:00	THRU	02/10/99    10:00:00
c)	Prior to 11:00 on February 10, the data logger was replaced with a 
recently calibrated, new unit (datalogger and sensors).
d)	At  06:30 on February 20, the turbidity spiked (601 NTU).  The high spike 
was probably caused by a clump of plant matter or sediment or an animal that 
passed by the sensor optics during the sampling interval.

a)	During the following periods, pH data were deleted because the sensor 
malfunctioned during the deployment.
02/01/99	00:00:00	THRU	02/10/99    09:30:00
b)	The following record includes a turbidity reading that is greater than 
1000 NTU.  The high value reflects the very turbid conditions that occur during 
heavy rainfall and high wind events.
02/01/99	02:30:00
c)	Prior to 10:00 on February 10, the data logger was replaced with a 
recently calibrated unit.
d)	During the following periods, the specific conductivity and salinity 
readings drifted downward as a result of fouling.  The in-situ readings taken 
with a refractometer was used to correct for the drift.  No in-situ specific 
conductivity readings are available, so we used a value observed at the same 
temperature during the next deployment to correct for the drift.  
We did not correct the dissolved oxygen readings, expressed as mg/L, because the 
last in-situ reading of the deployment (February 10-March 8) was similar to the 
Winkler check (9.1 and 8.5 mg/L, respectively).

b)	During the following periods, temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH data were deleted.  Prolonged periods of 
readings that are less than 28% air saturation followed by spikes indicate that 
the sensor was fouled by mud from nearby creek bank.

c)	During the following periods, the turbidity data were deleted. The sensor 
was fouled by mud from nearby creek bank, but no anomalies were evident.  
However, the operation of the wiper was probably hindered by the mud.

b)	During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) are suspect, but 
the data were not deleted.  The DO readings drop suddenly to extremely low 
levels and many are below 10% air sat.  The low readings occurred during a flood 
tide.  However, all quality assurance checks indicate that DO sensor was not 
fouled or punctured during the deployment, and the last in-situ DO reading was 
7.9 mg/L, and the DO field check reading was 6.2 mg/L.  The data will be re-
evaluated, and the data may be deleted at a later date.

06/14/99	05:00:00-10:00:00	18:30:00	23:00:00
c)	During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) readings are less 
than 28% air saturation.  The low readings occurred during late ebb tides and 
early flood tides.  A few readings represent dips in the DO during mid-flood 
tide; the sudden drop in DO was probably caused by the ambient environmental 
conditions.

d)	During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) readings are 
suspect, but data were not deleted.   The initial rapid increase in dissolved 
oxygen (35.7% to 174.9%) concentration suggests that the membrane was punctured 
at during that period.  However, all quality assurance checks indicate that DO 
sensor was not fouled or punctured during the deployment, and the last in-situ 
DO reading was 7.9 mg/L, and the DO field check reading was 6.2 mg/L.  The rise 
in temperature and dampening of the salinity diurnal pattern during this period 
suggest that environmental conditions may be a factor.  Further examination is 
required to determine the cause of the high readings.

e)	At 00:30 on June 29, salinity reading is less than 18 ppt. The reading is 
not within normal mesohaline/polyhaline salinity range (18 and 35 ppt) for this 
site.  Heavy rainfall events may have caused the low salinity conditions.

d)	During the following periods, dissolved oxygen (DO) does not exhibit a 
normal diurnal pattern.  Although DO readings are low, DO remain above 28% air 
saturation.  The anomalous readings was probably caused by environmental 
conditions during this period, as indicated by the unusually high salinity and 
low pH readings that occurred during the same time period.

h)	During the following periods, temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH readings were deleted.  The dampened or 
absent diurnal fluctuations indicated that the sensors were fouled by mud from 
the nearby creek.
08/23/99	00:00:00-11:00:00
i)	During the following periods, the turbidity readings were deleted.  The 
sensor was fouled by mud from nearby creek bank, but no anomalies were evident.  
However, the operation of the wiper was probably hindered by the mud.
08/23/99	00:00:00-11:00:00 
j)	The following record includes a negative turbidity reading (-2 to -10 
NTU). The negative reading is probably due to calibration error.  The post-
deployment calibration check indicated that the sensor worked properly during 
deployment.
08/24/99	05:30:00
k) 	During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) does not exhibit a 
normal diurnal patter.  The readings decreased during a flood tide and in some 
instances did not increase again until the next flood tide.  However, all 
quality assurance checks indicate that DO sensor was not fouled or punctured 
during the deployment, and the last in-situ DO reading was 7.9 mg/L, and the DO 
field check reading was 6.2 mg/L.  The reason for the anomalous readings is not 
known at this time.

e)	During the following periods, the temperatures readings were deleted.  The 
readings exceeded 50 oC, which are well above the range expected at this site (8 
to 38 oC).
Subsequently, salinity and dissolved oxygen (mg/L) readings, all of which are 
calculated from temperature readings, were deleted.
09/24/99	14:30:00-20:00:00
f)	During the following periods, the specific conductivity readings are 
suspect.  At 14:30, specific conductivity readings is 50% lower than preceding 
time period, and readings remain at this level during all but the 1530 h when 
reading spike by 50%.  However, the post-deployment checks did not indicate any 
sensor problem.  Reason for the anomalous readings are not known at this time.

salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH readings were deleted.  The dampened or 
no diurnal fluctuations and significantly lower readings than expected indicated 
that the sensors were fouled by mud from nearby creek bank.

g)	The following records include small negative turbidity readings (-1 NTU).  
The negative readings are probably due to a calibration error.  The post-
deployment calibration check indicated that the sensor worked properly during 
deployment.  Based on our knowledge of this site, the anomalous readings may be 
due to high sediment loading from nearby creek bank and creeklet.  Further 
investigation of this problem is needed.

e)	During the following periods, the specific conductivity and salinity 
readings are suspect.  The low reading are probably due to improper calibration 
procedures are contaminated standard.  Adjusted readings with correction factors 
as follows.
The correction factors for the specific conductivity and salinity data were 
calculated as follows.  First, a new conductivity standard was prepared.  Then 
the conductivity sensor was fully immersed in the standard and the specific 
conductivity and salinity readings were recorded.  Next, the sensor was 
calibrated, and the new specific conductivity and salinity readings were 
recorded.  The correction factor for the two parameters was calculated by 
dividing the reading taken after calibration by the reading taken prior to the 
calibration.  The specific conductivity and salinity data were multiplied by the 
correction factors (1.67 and 1.77, respectively).
In addition, the dissolved oxygen (mg/L) readings were reduced by 10%, in 
accordance with the oxygen solubility table.

St. Pierre
a)	During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen (DO) readings are 
suspect.  The readings are lower than those in the previous and subsequent 
deployment, indicating that the sensor was either improperly calibrated or the 
membrane or electrolyte was faulty.  The first DO reading (6.8 mg/L) and the 
last DO reading (5.6 mg/L) during the November 23-December 10 deployment are 
lower than Winkler checks (8.6 and 7.1 mg/L, respectively).  We may be 
able to adjust the values because the calculated ratios of the YSI readings to 
the Winkler readings are similar.

c)	During the following periods, pH data were deleted because the sensor 
malfunctioned during the deployment.  The last in-situ reading was significantly 
higher than the end-of-deployment field check (10.1 and 7.2, respectively).  In 
addition, the readings are significantly higher than previously observed at this 
site (pH 5.3-8.4).  
Although the pH calibration held through the deployment, the millivolt output 
from the sensors was outside the normal range while sensor was submersed in pH 7 
buffer and in pH 10 buffer.  The pH sensor was re-conditioned prior to the next 
deployment.
