2. Entry verification
The data are transmitted every thirty minutes from YSI 6600 datasondes 
via VHF packet radio using Ecowatch software to a base station PC. Files 
are first examined and graphed using Ecowatch software.  Missing and/or 
anomalous data are noted. Files are then transferred to a Macintosh 
computer and opened in Excel 5.0 software and edited. Missing data due 
to routine YSI maintenance and probe failure or communication errors are 
inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods (.). Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month of data.  Files are verified by means of CDMO 
Excel 5.0 macros. 
The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format column 
widths to the correct number decimal places based on the YSI sensor 
specifications. It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated file 
for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with periods, 
and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the datalogger is 
designed to measure (outliers). The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users 
with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week 
deployment and insert periods for missing data. Edited files are merged to 
contain one full month of data. In addition, in November 1999 a graphing 
capability was added to this macro allowing users to produce single parameter 
and missing point graphs on a monthly basis. All files are graphed in Excel and 
examined by Jaimie Wolf and Dr. Richard Langan in order that anomalous data 
points can be identified.



3. Research Objectives
In 2000, YSI 6600 datasondes were deployed in Great Bay and in the 
Squamscott and Lamprey Rivers part of the National Estuarine Research 
Reserves' (NERRS) Systemwide Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to 
develop and maintain temporally intensive long-term datasets of physio-
chemical parameters of water quality at locations that are 
representative of the Great Bay Estuarine System. The Great Bay site is 
relatively unimpacted, while the two tidal river sites (Lamprey and
Squamscott) have large drainage basins and are impacted by both point 
(wastewater treatment plants) and nonpoint sources of pollution.  In 
addition to establishing a baseline of water quality, and understanding 
the spatial and temporal variability of important indicators of 
estuarine water quality, the data is used by a number of researchers in 
the analysis of physical and biological processes.

4. Research Methods
Datasondes are programmed to obtain measurements of specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, pH, 
temperature, water level, and turbidity every half-hour. 
The instruments are deployed continuously during ice-free seasons, 
except for brief periods when they are removed for cleaning, maintenance 
and recalibration. Pre and post-deployment calibrations are performed 
using the diagnostics menu of the YSI Ecowatch program and QA/QC 
procedures developed by NERR Research Coordinators and YSI engineers. 
VWR conductivity and pH standards are used for calibration. Hach 
formazin is used to calibrate turbidity probes. 
The sonde in Great Bay is deployed in a YSI EM 550 buoy, while the 
Lamprey and Squamscott river stations are piling mounted deployments 
(see below). Because the sonde at the central Great Bay site (GB) is 
deployed in an EM 550 surface buoy, it does not measure depth data. 
Depth data for the GB site was obtained using time adjusted water level 
data from the Squamscott River site (SQ).

Site definitions: GB = Great Bay, SQ = Squamscott River, LR = Lamprey 
River

11. Data Anomalies:
Any anomalous or suspect data was removed from the data sets. Anomalous 
data was the result of either fouling of the probes, probe failure, lack 
of communication between the 1240 radio and the sonde, out of range 
data, or maintenance/calibration during which the sonde was in the lab.

where the radio and/or sonde failed to record or communicate. The data was not 
anomalous and not deleted because it didn't exist.

of range probably due to fouling and deleted.
During the month of October, the SQ had 26 isolated one half hour intervals 
where the radio and/or sonde failed to record or communicate. The data was not 
anomalous and not deleted because it didn't exist.
November
No turbidity data 11/1 0:00 - 11/30 23:30 all data out of range and deleted.
During the month of November, the SQ had 36 one half hour intervals where the 
radio and/or sonde failed to record or communicate. The data was not anomalous 
and not deleted because it didn't exist. This includes the period of time 11/21 
3:00 - 7:00.
No depth data 11/15 22:30 and 11/16 2300 - 23:30 data out of range, deleted.

Lamprey River
May
No data 5/1 0:00 - 5/17 9:30 sonde not deployed.
No dissolved oxygen 5/22 19:00 out of range, deleted.
No dissolved oxygen data 5/24 13:00 - 5/31 23:30 data out of range and deleted 
due to probe failure.
Salinity very low 5/25 - 5/28 without the higher salinity fluctuations that 
normally occur with the tides. This was caused by 1.43 inches of rain that fell 
between 5/23 and 5/25. The data is correct.
No turbidity data 5/30 0:30, 5/31 1:30 out of range, deleted.
June
No dissolved oxygen data 6/1 0:00 - 14:30 deleted due to probe failure.
No data 6/11 10:30 and 13:30 sonde did not record, for unknown reasons.
July
No turbidity data 7/7 9:30, 7/13 10:00, 7/17 15:00 - 15:30 out of range, 
deleted.
No conductivity or salinity data 7/13 6:30 - 7:00 out of range, deleted.

No pH data 7/13 17:30 - 19:00 out of range, deleted.
August
During August there were many turbidity data points that were out of range and 
deleted. Too numerous to list.
No depth, pH, turbidity data 8/5 17:00 sonde did not record these parameters for 
unknown reasons.
No data 8/5 17:30 - 20:30 sonde did not record for unknown reasons.
No data 8/11 9:30 - 12:30 sonde did not record for unknown reasons.
September

12. Missing Data:
All missing data is noted with a period (.). Data are missing due to equipment 
failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of equipment, 
elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to calibration 
problems, (both pre and post). For more details on the deleted data, see the 
Data Anomalies Section. To find out more details about missing data, please 
contact the research technician at the Great Bay site.
