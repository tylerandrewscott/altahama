2.  Entry verification.

Other water quality measurements are made by standard field methods at the time of datalogger 
deployment and weekly thereafter.  Results are compared with YSI 6000 data records.  Data may be 
corrected based on the comparative analyses and is then so noted in the data anomaly section of the 
metadata form. 

Temperature is measured by mercury thermometer calibrated with a NBS certified thermometer.  
Dissolved oxygen is determined by a modified Winkler titration.  Salinity is measured with a Hydrolab 
Surveyor 3 equipped with a salinity/ conductivity sensor.  The pH is determined by a Corning benchtop 
pH meter.  Turbidity is presently measured with a Secchi disk.  (This method does not provide data 
that is comparable to the YSI data.  An appropriate method recommended by the manufacturer and 
accepted by the scientific community will be used in the future.)  Allan Beck is responsible for 
these water quality measurements.

Data is uploaded to a PC from the YSI datalogger using the PC6000 software in both the PC6000 format 
and in comma delimited format.  The comma-delimited data is opened in Excel 5.0 and edited to remove 
headers and extra spaces.  Each file contains a month's data and missing days are denoted by periods.  
All files (December) have been verified using the Excel 5.0 macro programs that discover outliers 
(values out of the measurement range of the dataloggers, reformat data and check for missing 
dates/times by S. Adamowicz at the Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island.

3.  Research objectives.

YSI6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay as part of the 
National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR) Water Quality Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop 
long-term data sets for representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality 
over time. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on season, and 
measurements are taken every 30 minutes.  Currently two stations on Prudence, Potter Cove in the 
north and the T-wharf at the south-end, have been established.   The Potter Cove site, which was 
established in December 1995 receives waste from boaters and is considered an impacted site.  The T-
wharf site at the southern tip of the island was established in September 1996, and is considered 
relatively non-impacted.

4.  Research Methods.

Before each deployment, routine maintenance and calibration of the YSI instrument are carried out.  
The instrument is cleaned to remove any biofouling and the probes are checked for cracks or other 
visible signs of damage.  O-rings are cleaned and greased, and batteries installed.  Calibrations are 
performed for salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, depth, and turbidity.  For the salinity calibration, 
filtered seawater from Narragansett Bay is collected and its salinity determined using an autosal.  
This seawater is then used as a salinity 
standard. A two-point pH calibration is performed using pre-made buffer solutions of pH 7 and 9 
obtained from Fisher Scientific. Old pH solutions are used for rinsing the probes.  The dissolved 
oxygen membrane is replaced 24 hours prior to calibration.  The DO probe is then calibrated by 
placing a wet sponge in the calibration cup and allowing the instrument to equilibrate as per the 
manufacturers instructions for 100% air saturation calibration.  The depth sensor is calibrated to 
sea level with the sonde standing up in air, 
calibration cup removed.  The turbidity sensor is calibrated with distilled water (NTU = 0).

Currently a northern site, Potter Cove, and a southern site, the T-wharf (established 9/96), are 
being monitored. The sondes are deployed in PVC tubes with sections cut out to allow water flow.  The 
PVC tubes are attached to docks at each site.  The sondes are lowered by rope to a depth 
approximately one meter above the sediment.  The sondes are programmed to collect data every 30 
minutes 
during deployment.  Deployments generally last two weeks to four weeks and while initially there were 
gaps of several days between deployments, data collection is now continuous unless some mishap 
occurs.  At the end of each deployment, the data is uploaded, put in Excel format, and QA/QC'd using 
the Excel Macros provided by the CDMO.  

5.  Site Location and Character.

10. Data anomalies.

January, 1997: 
	PC:  Turbidity data include small negative numbers from 1/2 14:00 through 1/7 17:30 due to 
small calibration error.
	 TW:  Rise in DO on 1/21 is likely due to sonde redeployment.

February, 1997:
	PC:  No data anomalies.
	TW:  Turbidity spikes on 2/19 11:30 and 2/26 12:00 are considered anomalous.

March, 1997:
	PC:  Turbidity data included many small negatives from 3/7 11:30 through the end of the month 
due to a small calibration error.  Turbidity spike on March 10 04:30 is considered an anomalous event 
as is the drop in DO on March 20 20:00-22:00.
	TW:  DO drop from 3/30 - 3/31 at 0600 are possibly due to an anomalous event.

April, 1997:
	PC:  Turbidity data collected from 4/1 through 4/8 15:00 had small negative numbers due to 
calibration error.  DO fluctuations not originally noted by sonde and data manager in 1997.  Upon re-
evaluation of the data in 1999, the current data manager views these fluctuations as anomalous on 
4/4, 4/6, 4/24.
	TW:  The rise in DO values on April 2 at 17:30 are likely due to sonde redeployment.  Dissolved 
oxygen values highly variable beginning 4/25 10:30 when there was a drop from 9 to 2.92 mg/l in half 
an hour.  Values were continuously below 1 mg/l starting 4/28 1:00.  Anoxia at this well-flushed, 
non-impacted site is extremely unlikely.  When the sonde was retrieved, the probes were fouled and 
the DO charge (diagnostics check) was well above its normal range.  The DO data 
was therefore deleted from 4/28 1:00 through the end of the month, and the values dating back to 4/25 
should be viewed with suspicion.  Intermittent high negative turbidity values were recorded and left 
in the data set, may have been a result of fouling:
			4/9	4:30, 6:30, 10:00, 20:00
			4/15  11:00
			4/20  21:30
			4/26	12:30
			4/28 - 4/30  Mostly high negative turbidity values

May, 1997:
	PC:  Turbidity data collected from 5/23 11:30 through end of month included mostly small 
negative numbers with a few intermittent large negative numbers (notably on May 24).  From review of 
these data in 1999, the current data manager is considering the drop in specific 
conductivity/salinity on May 15 0900hr - May 23 1030hr as an anomaly.  The sharp rise in specific 
conductivity and salinity on May 23 at 1030 - 1130 hr is suspected to have been due to sonde 
redeployment.  Similarly, the rise in DO on May 23 at 1030 - 1130hr is thought to be due to 
redeployment.  
	TW:  High positive and high negative turbidity values recorded from 5/1 though 5/12 9:00, when 
the fouled sonde was retrieved.  Dissolved oxygen values were near zero and at times negative from 
5/1 - 5/12  9:00 (same sonde that was deployed at the end of April).  DO data was deleted for this 
period since a diagnostics check of the probe revealed an abnormally high DO charge.  The probe was 
reconditioned in the lab.  Problems with dissolved oxygen reoccurred towards the end of the month 
when DO dropped to <1 mg/l on 5/24 23:00.  Numbers were variable with many near zero values through 
the end of the month.  When the sonde was retrieved, a diagnostics check revealed an abnormally high 
DO charge of 130 (this is a different probe than the one deployed earlier in the 
month), and reconditioning did not bring the charge down into the normal range (25-75).  The probe 
was sent to YSI and the DO data deleted from 5/24 23:00 through the end of the month.

June, 1997:
	PC:  Turbidity data included mostly small negative numbers from 6/1 through 6/13 8:30.  The 
several spikes in turbdity (6/14 1800hr; 6/15 0830hr; 6/21 0430hr; 6/22 1400hr; 6/23 2030hr and 6/28 
1800hr) may be the result of an anomalous event.  Dissolved oxygen data was negative (-99.9%) on 6/13 
from 3:30 to 8:30 when the sonde was retrieved.  The problem was initially thought to be a membrane 
puncture, but may actually have been an internal probe failure, as indicated by the -99.9% number.  
The data was deleted (see missing data section).  On 6/23, DO values jumped suddenly from 6.75 mg/l 
at 13:30 to 47.57 mg/l at 14:00.  Numbers remained high for the rest of the deployment (through 
7/14).  When the sonde was retrieved, it was determined that the membrane had been punctured.  Do 
data was therefore deleted from 6/23 14:00 through the end of the month (see missing data section).  
Upon review of the data in 1999, it is thought that the drop in salinity on 6/19 1800hr - 2300hr may 
be an anomalous event or due to sonde redeployment.
	TW:  Dissolved oxygen data was anomalously low (<1) or negative from 6/1 - 6/9 11:00 since the 
same probe was deployed as in the end of May.  The DO data were deleted.  DO data for the rest of the 
month were highly variable, anomalously low and at times negative for the rest of the month.  A 
faulty probe had been redeployed by an inexperienced substitute technician.  The data was deleted and 
the probe sent to YSI upon retrieval.  The rise in pH values on 6/9 at 1100 - 1130hrs is due to sonde 
redeployment.


July, 1997:
	PC:  DO data was very high (c. 48 mg/l) from 7/1 - 7/14 9:00 due to a membrane puncture (see 
June data anomalies).  The data were deleted.  The turbidity data were higher than usual during the 
first half of July (through 7/14) and when the sonde was retrieved, the turbidity wiper was missing. 
On 7/06/97, turbidity was >1000 at 12:30 hour. This data is therefore somewhat suspect.  Specific 
conductivity/salinity fluctuations on 7/01 0000hr - 7/04 2100hr were reviewed in 1999.  These data 
may be the result of a passing storm or an anomalous event.  For comparison, see data for June 1998.  
This month was noted for above normal rainfall that occurred in a series of severe storms.  Upon 
reviewing the July 1997 data in 1999, there is no documentation regarding the rise in DO on July 19.  
This trend may be due to sonde redeployment although a series of DO problems were described in notes 
for August.

	TW: Dissolved oxygen data was anomalous (near zero or negative) during the first deployment of this 
month due to faulty probes.  DO data deleted from 7/1 00:00 through 7/7 16:30. 
Turbidity probe not deployed for month of July, or when deployed produced exceptionally suspect data, 
hence none included here.  Sonde deployed from 7/23/97 until 8/12/97 malfunctioned, data not included 
here.  

August, 1997: 
	PC:  Turbidity probe not deployed for month of August, or when deployed produced exceptionally 
suspect data, hence none included here. DO probe punctured 8/22/97 02:00 - 8/31/97 23:30 hours, so DO 
data not available for this time period.  Upon review of the data in 1999, notes on the data begin 
citing a shortage of DO probes (some sent for repairs?) and a likely puncture on 8/22 (see above).  
Also, a unit was redeployed on August 12 at 0900hr.  This unit produced a data values higher than for 
the previous deployment.  This may have been due to the manner in which the unit was calibrated.

	 TW: Sonde deployed from 7/23/97 until 8/12/97 11:30 malfunctioned, therefore all data was deleted
from 08/1 00:00:00 - 08/12 11:00:00.  Negative % DO values were obtained on the following dates and times: 
 8/27/97 
5:00 - 9:00, and were deleted.  Negative DO (mg/l) values were obtained on 8/27/97 from 5:00 - 9:00 
hours and were deleted. Upon review of the data in 1999, notes on the data begin citing a shortage of 
DO probes (some sent for repairs?).  Negative turbidity values obtained intermittently from 8/14/97 
07:30 until end of month, but left in the data set.  Negative turbidity values obtained on the 
following dates and times:  8/14/97 7:30 - 9:00; 8/14/97 15:00 - 8/15/97 9:00; 8/15/97 13:00 - 16:00; 
8/16/97 1:30 - 2:00; 8/16/97 4:30 - 6:00; 8/16/97 7:30 - 11:30; 8/16/97 12:30 - 16:00; 8/16/97 18:30 
- 22:30; 8/17/97 00:00; 8/17/97 1:00 - 10:00; 8/17/97 12:30 - 15:30; 8/17/97 18:30 - 22:30; 8/18/97 
00:00; 8/18/97 5:30; 8/18/97 6:30 - 10:00; 8/18/97 19:30; 8/20/97 16:00 - 18:30; 8/20/97 20:30 - 
8/21/97 2:30; 8/21/97 4:30 - 13:30; 8/21/97 14:30 - 8/22/97 16:00; 8/22/97 21:00 - 21:30; 8/23/97 
6:30; 8/23/97 21:30; 8/23/97 23:00 - 8/24/97 00:00; 8/24/97 1:30 - 3:00; 8/24/97 4:30 - 5:00; 8/24/97 
8:00 - 10:00; 8/24/97 14:00 - 18:00; 8/24/97 19:00 - 8/25/97 6:30; 8/25/97 9:30 - 11:00; 8/25/97 
15:00 - 17:30; 8/25/97 22:30 - 8/26/97 6:00; 8/26/97 7:30 - 15:00; 8/26/97 16:30 - 17:30; 8/26/97 
18:30 - 8/27/97 1:30; 8/27/97 2:30 - 9:00; 8/30/97 3:30 - 4:00.  Specific conductivity drop on 8/19 
may be due to redeployment.  Anomalous pH readings on 8/1 - 8/4 & 8/8 - 8/12.  

September, 1997:
	PC: From 09/01 00:00:00 - 09/10 07:30 DO data deleted due to suspected malfunction of DO probe.  
Turbidity probe problems continued. Negative values were reported on the following dates 
and times: 09/01/97 00:00 - 09/04/97 7:30 hr; 09/04/97 8:30 - 09/06/97 01:00; 09/06/97 2:00 - 
09/06/97 4:30; 09/06/97 5:30 - 09/07/97 8:30; 09/07/97 9:30 - 09/08/97 7:30; 09/08/97 8:30 - 09/08/97 
15:30; 09/08/97 17:00 - 09/09/97 - 22:00; and 09/09/97 23:00 - 09/10/97 7:30 hours.  DO values were 
exceptionally high from 09/01/97 at 00:00 hours until 09/10/97 07:30 hours, suspect DO probe 
malfunction.  DO problems resumed 09/26/97 09:00 hours until 09/30/97 23:30 hours; DO values 
exceptionally high (>51.9 mg/l) suspect probe failure.   Suspect DO values were deleted throughout 
the rest of the month.  

	TW: Turbidity problems continued with exceptionally high values in the beginning of the month 
and intermittently negative values, although suspect, these values were left in the data set.  
Negative turbidity values were recorded on the following dates and times: 09/04/97 12:00; 09/04/97 
16:30; 09/06/97 03:30; 09/07/97 12:00 - 13:00; and 09/09/97 03:30 hours.  Depth value 9/22/97 at 
09:00 exceptionally low, suspect this was an anomalous data point taken during retrieval, therefore 
this row of data was deleted.  

October, 1997:
	PC: Turbidity probe problems continued, no turbidity probe deployed until 10/16/97 15:30 hours.  
Turbidity spike on 10/25 at 1830 should be considered anomalous.  High DO values continued 10/01/97 
00:00 hours until 10/16/97 15:30 hours.  All readings were >17 mg/l.  Anomalous DO values deleted.  
Specific conductance/salinity drop on 10/13 at 0630 hr is likely an anomalous event.

	TW:  Turbidity probe problems continued, no turbidity probe deployed this month. DO values were 
very high (>16 mg/l) from 10/26/97 00:30:00 through 10/31/97 00:00:00. These anomalous DO values were 
deleted.  Upon reviewing the data in 1999, it is noted that the low specific conductivity/salinity 
values on the following dates are potentially anomalous events although they may be due to 
meteorological events:  10/6 1100 - 10/7 0900hr; 10/8 1630 - 10/11 1100hr; 10/12 0730 - 10/13 0830hr.  

November, 1997:
	PC: No turbidity data gathered from 11/16/97 18:30 hours until 11/30/97 23:30:00 hours.  
Turbidity spike on 11/08 at 1330 hrs is considered an anomalous event.
 
	TW: No turbidity data from 11/01 00:00:00 hr - 11/26 10:00:00 hr.  DO values began high (18.3 
mg/l) on 11/1/97 00:00:00 and remained high through 11/04/97 12:30:00.  This is a carry-over problem 
from October 1997. These anomalous data points were deleted. Values for DO became more reasonable on 
11/4/97 13:00:00.  

December, 1997:
	PC:  No turbidity data collected from 12/01/97 00:00 hours through 12/05/97 10:30 hours.  
Negative turbidity values recorded on several dates and times, suspect turbidity probe programming 
error.  Negative turbidity was recorded on the following dates and times: 12/06/97 20:00; 12/07/97 
13:00, 13:30; 12/13/97 14:00, 15:30, 20:00, 21:00; 12/14/97 05:30, 10:30 hours.  Negative turbidity 
values were left in the data set as per previous QA/QC procedures.

	TW:  First five DO % and mg/L values were higher than rest of deployment; possible the membrane
may not have had time to settle.  DO values deleted from 12/17 10:30 to 12:30 for this reason.  
Sonde deployed on 12/17/97 10:00 hr. was lost at sea during a storm, suspected date/time 
was 12/30/97 13:30 hr.  Unit was recovered in fall 1998.  Data easily accessed and downloaded, 
integrity appears high.  Data was not deleted after sonde was lost at sea since it represented only a 
day and a half and the sonde was recovered within sight of its original deployment location.  Users 
should note, however, the greater depth readings and changes in salinity etc. No turbidity data was 
collected from 12/17/97 10:30:00 hrs. until the end of the month.  


11. Missing Data.

January, 1997
	PC:  No turbidity 1/1 00:00 – 1/1 07:00.  No data, any variable, from 1/1 07:30 through 1/2 
13:00 due to servicing.  Beginning on 1/7 at 18:00 the data, all variables, are very intermittent, 
with large gaps.  Only a few data points were collected each day through 1/20 when the deployment 
ended.  Upon servicing, it was discovered that 
the battery contacts had become corroded and this likely accounted for the intermittent data 
collected. The contacts were sanded and the problem resolved.  No data was collected between 1/20 
14:30 and 1/31 14:00 because no sonde was deployed at that time.  Data collection did resume on 1/31 
at 14:30 
but no turbidity probe was deployed.
	TW:  No turbidity data collected from 1/1 - 1/21 9:30 since no probe was deployed.  No data 
recorded, any variable, on 1/1 14:30 and 1/19 10:30.  A sonde was deployed at these times but the 
intervals were skipped by the datalogger.  No data was collected on 1/21 10:00 and 10:30 due to 
servicing.

February, 1997:
	PC:  No turbidity data was collected during entire month because the sonde was not equipped 
with a turbidity probe.
	TW:  No turbidity probe deployed from 2/26 11:30 though the end of the month.

March, 1997:
	PC:  No turbidity data was collected from 3/1 through 3/7 10:30 since a turbidity probe was not 
deployed.
	TW:  No turbidity data for entire month since no probe was deployed.  No data for the following 
dates and times:  3/4/97 18:00; 3/6/97 19:30; 3/7/97 2:30;3/9/97 00:00;3/15/97 9:00; 3/17/97 16:00 - 
16:30.  

April, 1997:
	PC:  No data, any variable, collected 4/8 15:30 and 16:00 and 4/23 10:00 and 10:30 due to 
servicing. No turbidity data was collected after 4/8 15:00 since a turbidity probe was not deployed.
	TW:  No turbidity data from 4/1  to 4/2 17:30 since no probe was deployed.  No data was 
collected 4/2 16:30 and 17;00 since the sonde was being serviced.  Anomalous dissolved oxygen data 
was deleted from 4/28 1:00 through the end of the month (see Anomalous data section).

May, 1997:
	PC:  No turbidity data was collected 5/1 through 5/23 10:30 since a probe was not deployed.  No 
data, any variable on 5/23 11:00 due to servicing.
	TW:  No data collected any variable from 5/12 9:30 through 5/16 9:30 due to servicing.  No 
turbidity probe was deployed from 5/16 10:00 through the end of the month so there is no turbidity 
data.  Dissolved oxygen data was anomalous due to probe problems from 5/1 - 5/12 9:00 and from 5/24 
23:00 through the end of the month.  The DO data was deleted (see Anomalous Data section).

June, 1997;
	PC:  Negative DO data from 6/13 3:30 - 8:30 was deleted.  The negative numbers were caused by 
internal probe failure.  Very high DO numbers (c. 48 mg/l) from 6/23 14:00 through the end of the 
month were deleted.  The high numbers were caused by a membrane puncture.
	TW:  Dissolved oxygen data was anomalous (near zero or negative) during both deployments this 
month due to faulty probes.  Both the probes were sent in for repair and all the DO data for the 
month was deleted (see Anomalous data section for more details).  No turbidity probe was deployed 
this month so there is no June turbidity data.

July, 1997:
	PC:  DO data was deleted from 7/1 through 7/14 9:00 due to the membrane puncture which occurred 
in June.  No turbidity data was collected from 7/14 9:30 through the end of the month since there 
were no more wipers to mount on the probes.  Sonde out of water due to instrument swap on 7/14 09:30.  
	TW: Dissolved oxygen data was anomalous (near zero or negative) during the first deployment of this 
month due to faulty probes.  DO data deleted from 7/1 00:00 through 7/7 16:30.  Turbidity probe not 
deployed for month of July, or when deployed produced exceptionally 
suspect data, hence none included here.  No sonde deployed 07/07 17:00:00 hr through 7/23/97.  Sonde 
deployed from 7/23/97 until 8/12/97 malfunctioned, data not included here.  

August, 1997
	PC: Turbidity probe not deployed for month of August, or when deployed produced exceptionally 
suspect data, hence none included here.  From 08/08/97 08:30 hours until 08/13/97 09:00 no sonde 
deployed due to a shortage of DO probes.  From 08/22 02:00:00 hr - 08/31 23:30:00 hr no DO data due 
to suspected malfunction of DO probe.  

	TW: Sonde deployed from 7/23/97 until 8/12/97 11:30 malfunctioned, therefore all data was deleted
from 08/1 00:00:00 - 08/12 11:00:00.  Negative % DO values were obtained on the following 
dates and times:  8/27/97 5:00 - 9:00, and were deleted.  Negative DO (mg/l) values were obtained on 
8/27/97 from 5:00 - 9:00 hours and were deleted. Negative turbidity values obtained intermittently 
from 8/14/97 07:30 until end of month.

September, 1997:
	PC: From 09/01 00:00:00 - 09/10 07:30 DO data deleted due to suspected malfunction of DO probe.  
Turbidity probe problems continued, turbidity data collected only from 09/01 00:00:00 hr 
through 09/10 07:30:00 hr.  No sonde deployed 09/10/97 08:00 hours through 09/26/97 08:30 hours.  
DO problems resumed 09/26/97 09:00 hours until 09/30/97 23:30 hours; DO values 
exceptionally high (>51.9 mg/l) suspect probe failure.   Suspect DO values were deleted throughout 
the month.  

	TW: No sonde deployed 9/11/97 14:00 through 9/17/97 09:00.  Turbidity problems continued with 
exceptionally high values in the beginning of the month and intermittently negative values.  No 
turbidity probe deployed 9/17/97 09:30 through the end of the month.  Depth value 9/22/97 at 09:00 
exceptionally low, suspect this was an anomalous data point taken during retrieval; this row of data, 
therefore was deleted.

October, 1997:
	PC: Turbidity probe problems continued, no turbidity probe deployed until 10/16/97 15:30 hours.  
High DO values continued 10/01/97 00:00 hours until 10/16/97 15:30 hours.  All readings were >17 
mg/l.  Anomalous values deleted.

	TW:  Turbidity probe problems continued, no turbidity probe deployed this month. DO values were 
very high (>16 mg/l) from 10/26/97 00:30:00 through 10/31/97 00:00:00. These anomalous DO values were 
deleted.



November, 1997:
	PC: No turbidity data gathered from 11/16/97 18:30 hours until 11/30/97 23:30 hours.
 
	TW: No turbidity data from 11/01 00:00:00 hrs - 11/26 10:00:00 hrs.  DO values began high (18.3 
mg/l) on 11/1/97 00:00:00 and remained high through 11/04/97 12:30:00.  This is a carry-over problem 
from October 1997. These anomalous data points were deleted. Values for DO became more reasonable on 
11/4/97 13:00:00.

December, 1997:
	PC: No turbidity data collected from 12/01/97 00:00 hours through 12/05/97 10:30 hours.  
 
	TW: First five DO % and mg/L values were higher than rest of deployment; possible the membrane
may not have had time to settle.  DO values deleted from 12/17 10:30 to 12:30 for this reason.  
No turbidity data was collected from 12/17/97 10:30:00 hrs. until the end of the month.



12.  Other Remarks/Notes
	Probe failures have resulted in the loss of much dissolved oxygen and turbidity data, 
particularly in the summer.  Membrane puncture during deployment has also caused losses in DO data.  
We are currently working on ways to more effectively keep animals out of the probe guards.
