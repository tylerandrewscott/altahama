2.   Entry verification:
     The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 sonde to a comma delimited
file. It is imported into Excel 5.0 and edited according to the CDMO guidelines. The file is
exported as a tab-delimited file to the CDMO. Saundra Upchurch and Christopher Graffeo are
responsible for these tasks. 

3.   Experimental design:
     Agriculture and silviculture are not major industries within the Reserve boundaries but
impacts due to development on Edisto Island may be a problem. EPA-EMAP sampling in the
South Edisto River indicated that contaminant levels were higher than expected. Based on
discussions with local CZM personnel and our knowledge of land use within the Reserve, the
South Edisto River drainage basin appears to be best suited for studying contrasting hydrographic
conditions and land use patterns. One station is located by Edisto Island, within a tributary off Big
Bay Creek.  Surrounded by residential and commercial development and likely subject to nonpoint
source pollution, this station is designated as the "treatment" site. The second station is located
by Bailey Island, within a tributary off St. Pierre Creek. No urban development occurs in this area
surrounding the second station; thereby this station will serve as our "control" site.

4.   Research methods:
     The YSI monitoring program in the ACE Basin NERR was started in March 1995 at two
tributaries off Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks. Prior to the YSI deployment, a 12 foot galvanized
pole was driven two feet into the mud, and a 4 inch diameter PVC pipe, with pre-cut holes, was
bolted onto the pole, approximately 0.1 m (1 ft) above the creek bottom. The holes, or windows,
were cut out at the bottom of the pipes for the probes to have direct contact with the water
column.
     Sampling periods vary from one to three weeks, and measurements of specific
conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature and water level are recorded every 15
minutes. At the end of the sampling period, the YSI data loggers are brought back into the
laboratory for downloading, cleaning and calibration. These procedures are carried out according
to the methods outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual. Down time for cleaning,
calibrating, and servicing range from 24 to 48 hours.
     At the April 28 datalogger redeployment, the data loggers at both sites were moved to
deeper sections of the two tributaries because the probes of the data loggers were not submerged
continuously at their former locations. The new locations are within one meter of the former
locations. Starting August 11, the logging interval was changed from 15 minutes to 30 minutes.

5.   Site location and character:
     The two sampling sites are located in two tributaries off South Edisto River. The
descriptions of the sites are as follows:
     Station A--this site is located in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek (GPS coordinates:
32 29.662N and 80 19.427W). Surrounded by residential and commercial development and likely
subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is designated as the "treatment" site. Pollution
sources include houses bordering the creek, many with little setback from the bordering Spartina
marsh; 20 docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and Wolmanized pilings; boat
dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a paved road and three boat ramps off the creek;
a marina with 75 slips, CCA treated bulkheads and fueling areas located about 0.5 miles
downstream; two commercial seafood docks with 8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three
restaurants. The creek is closed to shellfish harvesting indicating a high concentration of fecal
coliforms. Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora with
isolated areas of Salicornia. Upland fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oak and cedars.
Reefs of American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fringe the creek banks. At the time of
reconnaissance, depth of the creek midway through ebb tide was 5 feet and salinity was 23%.
     Station B--this site is located in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (GPS coordinates: 32
31.724N and 80 21.573W). It is surrounded by a wide expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh.
Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs fringe the banks. Upland areas are dominated by maritime
forest with wax myrtles, live oaks, and palmettos. No development and no agriculture occur in
this portion of the reserve. This creek is subject to little boat traffic. At the time of
reconnaissance, depth at low tide was 2.5 feet and salinity was 21%.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
   In 1993, the Reserve staff initiated a long-term survey of the decapod crustaceans and
juvenile fish that utilize the estuarine waters of the Reserve as a nursery ground. There are four
sampling stations in each of the three major rivers, Ashepoo, Combahee and South Edisto, of the
Reserve. Stations are located along a salinity gradient, ranging from polyhaline to oligohaline or
limnetic. Sampling is done each month during daylight flood tide. Trawls are 10 minutes long and
tows are made against the tide. Several physical parameters are measured at each station: air and
water temperature, salinity, wind speed and direction, water depth and tidal stage. Cloud cover
and rainfall conditions are also recorded at each station. To date, we have caught seventy-one
species of fish and twenty-eight species of decapod crustacean species.
   Drs. Judith and Peddrick Weis are studying the impacts of Chromated Copper Arsenate
(CCA)-treated wood on the surrounding benthic communities at several Reserve sites, including
the ACE Basin and North Inlet-Winyah Bay. The objective of their study is to determine to what
degree and over what distances benthic fauna may be adversely affected by the contaminants. In
our Reserve, surface sediment grabs were collected near CCA-treated wood and concrete marine
structures in Big Bay Creek and near an undisturbed salt marsh along St. Pierre Creek. The
sediment samples will be analyzed for particle size distribution, organic carbon, copper,
chromium and arsenic, and the benthic biota will be identified and analyzed for copper, chromium
and arsenic as well for species richness, abundance, and biomass. Motile consumers such as crabs
and fish will be analyzed for metals to investigate trophic transfer of wood-derived contaminants.
The Weis' are in the process of analyzing the data.
   Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews are assessing the distribution of contaminants (i.e. trace
metals, PAHs, pesticides) in sediments within the rivers of the Reserve. Surface sediment grabs
were collected from twelve sites in the Reserve. Ten sites are located along a salinity
gradient in Ashepoo, Combahee and South Edisto rivers, and two sites are located in the vicinity
of our data logger sites. Surface sediment grabs were collected in 1994 from each site, and the
samples will be analyzed for trace metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, etc.), PAHs and
pesticides. Results will be available by September 1995.

March 1-31, 1995 Sampling Period
   Big Bay
a) Between March 14- 31, specific conductance, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, expressed in
   mg/L, data were deleted because the specific conductance readings exceeded the normal range
   of values for estuarine waters (>50.0 mS/cm) (see Missing Data section).The salinity and
   dissolved oxygen data were deleted because these values are calculated from specific
   conductance readings.
b) The following records include negative depth readings but the data were not deleted because
   specific conductance and dissolved oxygen readings indicated that the sonde was submerged.
   The negative depth values were probably due to low barometric pressure weather systems.

b) The following records include specific conductance values below level expected for
   mesohaline/polyhaline waters (<18 mS/cm), but the data were not deleted. Spikes in
   dissolved oxygen also occurred during these periods. Extremely low tides or heavy rainfall
   may have caused the unusual readings.

April 1-30, 1995 Sampling Period
   Big Bay
a) Between April 1 and 10, specific conductance, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, expressed in
   mg/L, data were deleted because the specific conductance readings exceeded the normal range
   of values for estuarine waters (>50.0 mS/cm) (see Missing Data section).The salinity and
