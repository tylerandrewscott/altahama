2. Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a PC from the YSI 6000UPG data logger and graphs are 
produced and quickly examined using the PC6000 software.  Data files are then 
exported from the PC6000 format into Excel (for Windows NT 3.1) files where the 
headers, footers, and inappropriate spaces are removed.  Plots of the data are 
made and suspect data (outliers) are dealt with accordingly.  Removed data 
points and missing data are replaced with a periods (.).  Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month for each data logger.  Data is then QA/QC'd 
using the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros and Appendix B., YSI 6000 Data Review and 
Editing Protocol.  Dave Nemazie was responsible for data management.  

3. Research Objectives
The purpose of the monitoring program at CBM NERR is to conform to the NERR SWMP 
monitoring program looking at trends in water quality over both temporal and 
spatial scales.  Differences in how marshes can change water quality is being 
studied by comparing a marsh creek site to a river channel site.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes over a 5-14 day period at both the Patuxent River 
Park (PR) and Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) sites.  

4. Research methods (YSI data loggers)
Each YSI data logger is laid down on a 4" diameter PVC pipe that has been cut in 
half.  The PVC is nailed to a 4"x4" block of wood which secured to a crab pot.  
The crab pot with the data logger in it sits on the bottom at both sites.  At 
each site, the crab pot is locked to a pier.  The YSI probes sit approximately 
6-10 centimeters above the sediment.  Every 30 minutes up to a two-week period, 
measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, temperature and water level are recorded.  Within 14 days of deployment, 
the data is downloaded and either new calibrated probes or a new YSI unit with 
calibrated probes are placed at each site.  At times, however, probes and/or 
units could not be replaced resulting in prolong periods (up to 5 days) of 
missing data.  Calibration procedures are carried out according to the methods 
described in the YSI Operating Manual. All calibration standards are purchased 
from scientific warehouses.  


5. Site location and character
The Chesapeake Bay NERR - Maryland has three components in Maryland’s portion of 
the Chesapeake Bay.  Monie Bay is a mesohaline region on the lower Eastern 
Shore; Otter Point Creek is a tidal freshwater river and marsh system; and Jug 
Bay is part of the freshwater portion of the Patuxent River.  Both data loggers 
are within the Jug Bay component.

1) Patuxent River Park (PR) - (38 deg 46’ 00” N, 76 deg 42’ 30” W) is on the 
Prince Goerges County side of the River.  The data logger is on the flank of the 
River channel off of Jackson Landing.   The Patuxent is approximately 50 meters 
wide at Jackson Landing.  High sedimentation rates have led to a very soft 
bottom at this point in the Patuxent River.  Salinity rarely reaches above 1 
ppt.
2) Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) - (38 deg 46’ 00” N, 76 deg 42’ 30” W) is on 
the Anne Arundal County side of the River directly across from PRP.  The data 
logger is in a shallow tidal marsh creek that is approximately 5 meters wide.  
Wide temperature fluctuations are normal at this site.

6. Data collection period
Data loggers were placed in the water in early June 1998 and removed in late 
September 1998 just after ice began to form at both sites.

7. Associated researchers and projects
The Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary staff have been collecting weekly to monthly 
temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient samples at the same 
location as the data logger at JBWS.  In addition a graduate student has 
measured denitrification rates while another student has compared dissolved 
oxygen measurements using various techniques at the JBWS site.
