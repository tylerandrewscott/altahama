2. Entry Verification

Data are uploaded to the PC from the Data loggers and graphs are produced using 
EcoWatch software.  Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from 
probe failure, biofouling or human error.  Notes are made of any unusual data, 
and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .csv 
files using EcoWatch software.  The .csv files are imported into EXCEL, edited 
by removing headers and footers, and saved as EXCEL files.  Data at the 
beginning and end of each data record that were recorded when the instruments 
were out of the water are deleted. These data are identified by field notes that 
document the times in and out of the water, and by unusual depth data, usually 
negative or near zero.  The appropriate files are merged to form complete 
monthly data sets and are saved as separate EXCEL files. Data that are missing 
because the instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are 
denoted by periods (.).  These times are noted in section 11 of this document. 
Two types of post-calibration values are also used to determine operational 
viability of the sensors while deployed. One is obtained in the lab by placing 
un-cleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values given by the 
Data loggers.  The second type is obtained in the field using a newly calibrated 
Data logger (referred to as a control sonde). Data from this instrument are 
recorded in the field at the time of the last scheduled reading by the deployed 
Data loggers.  Both post-calibration values are reported in section 13 of this 
document, and may be used to determine the quality of the data recorded by the 
instruments (particularly DO) after deployment in the field.  Any erroneous data 
that are identified as being caused by probe failures (as determined upon 
examination of the data plots, or by post-calibration values) are deleted and 
replaced with periods, and noted in section 11 of this document.  Sensor 
readings that greatly deviate from known values of standards after the two-week 
deployment are not necessarily believed to be a result of probe failure, 
however.  If moderate biofouling is believed to be the reason for poor agreement 
between the sensors and the standard values at the end of a deployment, the data 
are retained and noted in section 11 of this document.  Symptoms of probe 
failures are extreme noise in the record, unrealistically high or negative data, 
or noisy or negative readings in standard solutions.  Examples of many such 
failures are given in the CDMO Manual (Version 3.0). Finally, the CDMO macros 
(update version 11/96) are used. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macros allow the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications. It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (outliers). Scott Phipps and Eric Brunden 
were responsible for all data management.

3. Research Objectives/Study Purpose

The Data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 
minutes.  Presently, two instruments are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve.  One 
is located at the mouth of Fish River (provides ~73% of Weeks Bay's freshwater), 
and the other is located on the eastern side of Weeks Bay, near the mouth.

Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon Secour 
Bay.  Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show that 
bottom waters (which flow into Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic in 
summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also in question, as 
largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during 
periods of high flow in the river.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if 
poor water quality periodically observed in Weeks Bay is generated within the 
bay proper, or is being introduced from Fish River or Bon Secour Bay with 
changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these 
two sites may be used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.  

There is a great deal of value in having a baseline data set for any management 
site. Changes or trends in any monitored parameters are readily apparent. Weeks 
Bay is useful as a model for estuary function and this data is necessary for the 
profile of the model. 

4. Research Methods

Data loggers are moored on private docks.  At each dock, a PVC tube is attached 
to a piling at the end of the dock using ratchets equipped with zinc disks (to 
help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A chain, attached to the cap of the 
tube, is shackled to the bail of the Data logger.  Chains and tubes were cut to 
a length that places the Data logger probes just below the bottom of the tube 
and 0.5 m above the sediment when in place.  A nylon rope tied to the bottom of 
the piling also runs through the tube and is attached to the bale of the Data 
logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the Data loggers in the event 
that the tube breaks away from the piling.

The Data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation and concentration, pH, water 
level and turbidity every 30 minutes central standard time (CST).  When 
available, a newly calibrated Data logger is also used to record the above 
parameters at the same time the deployed Data logger takes its first reading to 
insure its initial accuracy.  The instruments are usually serviced (instruments 
post-calibrated, data uploaded, instruments cleaned and re-calibrated) every 7 
days; however, they are programmed to log for 30 days in the event they cannot 
be serviced on schedule.  Just before deployment, window screening (1mm mesh 
size) is wrapped once around the cage that protects the sensors, and secured 
with plastic electrical tape.  Window screening is also secured in the bottom of 
the cage with silicone sealant.  This is done to reduce error in the data that 
may be due to larger animals moving in and out of the cage during the 
deployment.  This does not, however, preclude smaller animals such as barnacle 
and polychaete larvae from entering the cage and settling on the sensors.

Before the Data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated Data logger (when 
available) is lowered to the depth of the deployed instrument, and readings are 
logged at the same time that the deployed instruments are programmed to record.  
Post-calibration values are obtained in the lab by placing un-cleaned probes in 
standard solutions and recording the values given by the Data loggers.

Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as described in 
the YSI Operating Manual.  Calibration standards required for pH are purchased 
from a scientific supply house. Turbidity and salinity standards are created in 
house per Standard Methods (16th Ed.). Dissolved oxygen is calibrated using a 
calibration cup filled with about 1/2cm tap water, which creates a 100% water-
saturated air environment for the sensors when the sonde is placed in the cup.  
The sensors are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 minutes in the cup before 
DO (%Saturation) is calibrated.  

Servicing the instruments may result in a period of about 3 to 4 hours of 
missing data every week at each site. When sufficient numbers of data loggers in 
good working order are available, newly calibrated sondes are swapped with 
sondes at the end of their deployments so that no data points are missed. In 
this case a control sonde, the new deployment sonde and the old deployment sonde 
all log at the same time at the same depth (ie. first log, last log and control) 
for QA/QC comparison.  

5. Site Locations and Character

Weeks Bay (30 23' N, 87 50' W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, 
located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It 
is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) runs nearly 
north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to the mouth, where 
water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near 
the center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side 
of Weeks Bay.  Average depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths 
are significantly greater.  The first is in the mouth of the bay, where the 
average depth is 6 m; the second is about 100 m upstream of the mouth of the 
Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally diurnal, 
and have a mean range of 0.4 m.

The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 14,300 hectares and contributes 
approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow with the Magnolia River 
supplying the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 cubic meters per second; 
although freshets up to 4 times larger occur throughout the year.  These 
characteristics result in a freshwater residence time of 13 days under average 
discharge conditions, with a range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay 
varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  During periods of high flow 
in the river, salinity in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, 
except in the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  
However, during periods of low flow in the river, wind velocity and tidal stage 
are strong factors influencing salinity structure.  Salinity greater than 25 ppt 
is infrequently observed in Weeks Bay and is usually restricted to the southern 
portion of the estuary near the mouth.

Site FR (Fish River; 30 24.97'N, 87 49.37'W) is located near the mouth of Fish 
River at a mean depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there are 
small patches of Vallisneria sp. growing near (but not directly under) the Data 
logger.  Land use in the water shed is agricultural, forested and residential 
with the residential portion rapidly increasing.  Directly surrounding the site, 
land use is residential and forested.  Nutrient concentrations at this site are 
variable and may be quite high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations 
ranging from approximately 4-100 然 and <0.5 to 7.5 然, respectively, over the 
previous 10 years (Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Geological 
Survey of Alabama).  Over the past year, salinity ranged from 0 to 25 ppt at 
this site.

Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 22.85' N, 87 49.92' W) is located near the southeast 
shore of Weeks Bay, about 0.5 kilometers from the mouth of the estuary.  Mean 
water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land use 
around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture occurring 
inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at site Fish 
River. Over the previous 10 years, nitrate and phosphate concentrations here 
ranged from approximately 0.1 to 50 然 and 0.04 to 0.45 然, respectively.  
Salinity ranged from approximately 5 to 27 ppt over the past year.

10. Coded Variable Indicator and Variable Code Definitions
	
FR = Fish River, WB = Weeks Bay.  File definitions: deployment site, WQ (water 
quality), month, year; for example WBWQ0898 = Weeks Bay water quality data from 
August of 1998.

11. Data Anomalies

General Information:

We have deleted data when either technical difficulties or extensive biofouling 
resulted in questionable data.  Therefore, we feel that extreme caution should 
be used when evaluating these data (especially DO % sat. and concentration) 
because of problems with biofouling.  Particularly during the summer months, 
biofouling can cause severe degradation of the DO calibration over the two-week 
deployments.  At times the DO deviation from calibration at the end of a 
deployment was greater than 80% (in a water-saturated air environment).  We have 
made note of any data that we consider suspect because of biofouling, based on 
post-calibration values reported by the sensors, control sonde readings, and 
visual inspection.  
Year 2001 precipitation totals were near average. However groundwater levels may 
be below normal due to the two previous years of drought. Monthly precipitation 
totals ranged from a low of 10.41mm in April to a high of 352.18mm in July. 
Monthly precipitation totals are noted in this section for each month.  We have 
also provided the data that were taken in the field at the time of the final 
logging interval before retrieval of the deployed Data loggers, as well as the 
post-calibration values (for details see section 4, above) in section 13 below.  
We encourage anyone using these data to first compare with the discrete Data 
logger readings and post-calibration values on the given dates before evaluating 
the data.  If the user desires, it is possible to use these data to correct the 
deployed YSI data using regression analysis.  If not, then the user should 
delete compromised data at their discretion.

September 2001: Precipitation 106.43
At site FR,
Dissolved oxygen data from deployment FR164 (09/03/01 20:30 to 09/07/01 07:30) 
deleted due to extreme biofouling of sensor probe. 
The depressed DO values within deployment FR165 (09/07/01 08:00 to 09/14/01 
08:30) are thought to reflect naturally occurring events. Low biofouling found 
on probe, near normal post calibration readings and consistency between 
deployment and control sonde values support this view.
Depth reading on 09/28/01 09:00 believed to be low due to the sonde catching in 
the stationary site tube.
