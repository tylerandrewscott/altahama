2.  Entry verification
The data were uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 data loggers and reviewed 
using PC6000 software from YSI. Graphs were produced and examined using the 
PC6000 software then printed out and filed in order to aid in reviewing data to 
correlate any anomalous and outlying data.  Next, files were uploaded in comma 
delimited format which were opened in Excel 5.0 software and edited to remove 
extraneous information (headers, footers, spaces, and pre- and post-deployment 
data).  Monthly templates were used to form complete sets of monthly data sets.  
Macros supplied by NERRS/CDMO were used to help with editing, formatting and 
identifying outliers in the database.  Suspect data (as in data believed to 
result from a damaged or biofouled probe) were evaluated according to Appendix B 
of the CDMO manual, edited and documented. Missing data due to YSI maintenance 
(down time) were inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods (.).  Data 
that were not within calibration range of the instrument were evaluated and 
removed from the record and denoted by periods.  Edited and raw data files were 
copied and archived in the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve 
Virginia (CBNERRVA) file server and uploaded to the CDMO FTP site.  All Taskinas 
Creek files from 1995 have been verified using the latest update of the 
Microsoft Excel 5.0 macro programs which identified outliers (values that fall 
outside of the calibration range– see section II.8 of this document) and other 
erroneous data.  Outliers were determined according to the instruments’ 
manufacturers manual. Rob Breeding edited data from 9/95-12/95.  Bill Seufzer 
updated and corrected the Rob Breeding edited data.  Tammy Dorman processed the 
data through the latest update of the CDMO macro and conducted final editing of 
the data.  Following final editing, Tammy Dorman uploaded the database to the 
CBNERRVA server and to CDMO.  

3.  Research Objectives
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain rural 
watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This watershed is 
dominated by forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land 
use component.  The drainage basin is suited for investigating hydrologic and 
nonpoint source water quality issues associated with changing land use patterns; 
these issues are of prime importance to the U.S. EPA Chesapeake Bay Program.  
Continuously monitored physical water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, 
specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) provide long-term measurements 
which can be supplemented with shorter-term monitoring and process oriented 
studies.  Measurements were taken every 15 minutes at the Taskinas Creek site 
and the YSI data loggers were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at 
two-week intervals.  

4. Research methods 
The CBNERRVA maintains a long-term water quality-monitoring program, which 
consists of a single station located in the transitional zone of the York River 
tributary.  A simple deployment was arranged with the State Park where a secured 
YSI 6000 unit hangs at a fixed depth  (0.5m above the creek bed) from an 
overhanging tree approximately six meters upstream from the parks canoe landing.  
Specific conductance, pH, depth, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity 
are recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity and DO saturation are calculated 
as a function of temperature and specific conductivity readings.   Turbidity 
data was not collected until 1/96. At approximately two-week intervals,  the 
data logger was returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, membrane 
replacement and recalibration. Maintenance intervals were determined according 
to the amount of biofouling that occurred and to accommodate battery life.  A 
second YSI 6000 data logger was deployed following retrieval of the original YSI 
data logger in order to maintain a continuous record. All procedures are in 
accordance with the YSI Operating Manual methods, sections 3 and 7.  Standards 
for pH, and conductivity were purchased from YSI.  Data is reviewed and edited 
according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO 
manual.  

5. Site location and character 
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component: (Latitude 37 deg 24’ 54.04617” N, Longitude 76 deg 42’ 
51.75733” W).  The Taskinas Creek Component of the CBNERRVA is on the south shore 
of the York River in James City County near Williamsburg.  The site is 
approximately 44 kilometers upstream from the river's mouth and 15 kilometers 
downstream from West Point.  Headwaters of Taskinas Creek are near the town of 
Croaker, which is located approximately 10 kilometers north of Williamsburg.  
The creek flows in a northeasterly direction covering a distance of about 5.5 
kilometers eventually feeding into the York River.   The sampling station is 
located on the second bend from the mouth of Taskinas Creek within York River 
State Park, about 6 meters upstream from the parks canoe landing.  The sediment 
type at this station consists of 42% fine sand, 30% clay, and 28% silt.  The 
creek is tidal for approximately half of its length with a tidal range of 0.00-
1.3m.  The non-tidal portion contains feeder streams, which drain oak-hickory 
forests, maple-gum-oak-ash swamps and freshwater marshes. The marshes near the 
creek mouth are brackish with a salinity range from 3-13 ppt.  The shoreline is 
moderately low with fringing marsh and tidal flats.  Taskinas Creek mainly 
drains the undeveloped York River State Park watershed, however the watershed is 
lightly impacted above the State Park by residential development and selective 
hardwood logging.  Wildlife populations have been shown to influence 
microbiological water quality within the watershed.  

6.  Data collection period
Ongoing sampling at Taskinas Creek (TC) began September 12, 1995.

7. Associated researchers and projects
A volunteer water quality-monitoring program sponsored by the Alliance for the 
Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing at Taskinas Creek for several years since its 
inception January 10, 1990. This project samples some overlapping parameters 
including dissolved oxygen and salinity on a two-week basis.

YSI):

Variable      Range of Measurements (units)    Resolution           Accuracy

9. Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions
Site definitions: TC = Taskinas Creek.
File definitions: YSI deployment site/month/year (ex.: TC0995 = Taskinas Creek 
data from September 1995). 

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data)
Infrequent data anomalies were recorded in depth levels for several months 
potentially due to low-pressure weather fronts.  This data remained in the 
database.  According to the CDMO Operations manual version 3.0, depth 
measurements taken with a non-vented level probe can be influenced by as much as 
0.39m (1.3 feet) during a severe low-pressure hurricane event.  Specific dates 
and time ranges of potentially influenced data are listed with each respective 
month.

September 1995:
TC: 
9/13/95 06:00:00 to 08:00:00 				Negative depth values due to low 
tides or low-pressure system
9/13/95 18:15:00 to 20:45:00 				Negative depth values due to low 
tides or low-pressure system	
9/14/95 05:45:00 to 07:00:00 				Negative depth values due to low 
tides or low-pressure system 
9/14/95 07:15:00 to 08:00:00 				All sensors were out of water 
due to low tide
9/14/95 08:15:00 to 09:45:00 				Negative depth values due to low 
tides or low-pressure 
9/14/95 18:30:00 to 22:00:00 				Negative depth values due to low 
tides or low-pressure system
9/14/95 23:00:00 to 9/27/95 09:00:00			DO data (%Sat and mg/l) have 
been deleted.  It appears that during a low tide the sensors were out of the water.  
It is possible that the DO membrane dried out causing readings after this event 
to drift towards zero.
9/22/95 14:00:00 to 15:15:00 				Negative depth values due to low 
tides or low-pressure system.

October 1995: 
TC:
10/21/95 09:45:00 to 10/31/95 23:45:00 			Suspect DO probe is bad; low 
pre- DO% and high post- DO% usually indicates a problem with the membrane integrity or the 
probe itself. 
10/21/95 09:45:00 to 10/31/95 23:45:00 			pH readings drifted possibly due 
to a bad probe.  The graph of the data indicates a probe malfunction. 
10/24/95 04:00:00 to 04:30:00				Negative depth values due to 
low tides or low-pressure system 

10/30/95 08:45:00 to 09:30:00, 10/30/95 21:30:00, and 10/31/95 09:45:00 to 
11:15:00 Three low salinity records occurred due to freshwater movement downstream on 
very low tides, or the probes were out of the water.  If the probes were out of the water	
and atmospheric pressure was great enough, the depth data could still show a slightly 
positive number.  Close examination of the data shows a sharp drop of salinity and 
conductivity with a later sharp increase.  This adds weight to the argument of probes 
being out of the water.  Data from these events have been left intact, but should be 
treated as suspect.

10/30/95 21:45:00 to 10/30/95 23:15:00 			All sensors were out of the 
water due to a low tide
		
November 1995:
TC: 
11/01/95 00:00:00 to 11/03/95 16:30:00			Suspect DO probe is bad - 
low pre- DO% and high post- DO% usually indicates a problem with the membrane integrity 
or the probe itself.
11/01/95 00:00:00 to 11/03/95 16:30:00 			pH readings drifted possibly due 
to a bad probe.  The graph of the data clearly indicates that there was something wrong 
with this probe.
11/05/95 03:00:00 to 03:45:00 				Low DO spikes occurred 
during low tide conditions
11/07/95 16:00:00 to 17:45:00 				Negative depths due to low 
tides or low-pressure systems
11/07/95 17:00:00 to 20:45:00				Low DO spikes occurred during 
low tide conditions
11/09/95 18:30:00 to 20:00:00				Low DO spikes occurred during 
low tide conditions
11/12/95 07:00:00 to 11:30:00 				Low DO spikes occurred 
during low tide conditions
11/17/95 14:30:00 to 11/30/95 23:45:00 			Depth data removed; it appears 
that the depth port may have been plugged resulting in many periods of negative data and peak 
depths much lower than normal.

11. Missing data
Missing data is either the result of
  1) the YSI not deployed (exact reason unknown**)
  2) a probe not attached
  3) a probe malfunction
  4) probe exposure to the atmosphere

    ** Exact reasons are unknown due to change in staffing.

12.  Remarks:
In 1995, several files were recorded in Daylight Savings Time instead of Eastern 
Standard Time (EST).  Tammy Dorman corrected the following files so that they would 
be in accordance with the NERR System Wide Monitoring Program by displaying the 
date and time in EST.  
	TC950912.csv was corrected to EST
	TC951021.csv was corrected to EST
	TC951103.csv was corrected to EST

Any regions of data with negative depth values due to low tides or low-pressure 
systems should be viewed with caution. In some instances the probes are clearly 
out of water and have been noted.  Depth data should be considered relative depth.  
The instrument was deployed on a rope that was tied to a tree branch and therefore 
may have been deployed at a slightly different depth for each deployment.  This 
situation was corrected in the fall of 1996 with the use of steel cable and mounting 
hardware that keeps the instrument at a fixed elevation above the creek bottom, 
however is influenced by the current causing the instrument to sway as the tides change.  
Taskinas Creek experiences extremely low tides where it is difficult to determine 
times when the probes are out of the water and when they are not.  If the YSI would 
have been more securely deployed and at a fixed depth from the bottom, the problem 
of exposure from low tides might have been lessened.  Also there is an ongoing problem 
with land subsidence in Taskinas Creek, which at times affects our deployment because
the tree from which our unit is attached, sinks with the land.  Current efforts are being 
made to construct a more stable and elevation referenced station.
