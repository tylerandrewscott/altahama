2.  Entry verification:

The data are directly downloaded in the YSI-PC6000 format (as a .dat file) and 
the Comma Delimited format (as a .csv file) from the dataloggers to an IBM lap-
top.  The data are reviewed using the PC6000 software (Eco-Watch).  Graphs and 
basic statistics are then generated with the Eco-Watch program and the 
information is printed out for each data file.  These graphs are used to 
determine any obvious data outliers and sonde and/or probe malfunction.  All 
downloaded data files from the dataloggers (both raw unedited .dat and .csv 
files) are then transferred via disk to a Power Mac G3, where all files are 
reviewed and  formatted for CDMO and stored.  Here the raw unedited .csv data 
files are imported into Microsoft Excel 98.  After a complete month of data has 
been recorded, each file is ready to review which requires several steps.  The 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macros are used for all data.  A data file is created 
(from the merged raw unedited .csv data files) in Excel format with a full month 
of data.  The first step is to make sure that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order, specified by the NERR CDMO.  If any parameters are not collected 
due to probe failure or other causes, the cells with this missing data are 
filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in the appropriate 
section of the metadata.  Secondly, missing dates and times are inserted in the 
data file where data were not collected due to maintenance, sonde failure, etc., 
and the cells with this missing data are filled in with periods (.) and 
documented and explained in the appropriate section of the metadata.  The first 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is then run to determine if there are any missing 
dates and times; and if so these missing dates and times are inserted.  Next, 
the second NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is used to find and filter all data 
readings outside the sonde specification measuring range for each parameter.  
Here the "outlier" data generated by the second macro are examined and 
determined as either explained or unexplained anomalies, as specified by NERR 
CDMO Operations Manual.  All anomalous data (explained and unexplained) are 
documented and explained in the appropriate sections of the metadata.  The 
explained anomalous data are then removed from the data file and replaced by 
periods.  The unexplained anomalous data are investigated for validity based on 
weather data, field observations, instrument diagnostics, and Eco-Watch 
printouts.  If these data are rejected from the file then these are removed and 
replaced by periods.  Lastly, the third and final NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is 
used to reformat all the columns in the data file to the correct number of 
significant digits.  After this last step, once the file has been completely 
formatted and edited as specified by NERR CDMO, the file is saved as a Tab 
delimited (.txt) text file and sent by FTP to the CDMO.  The metadata form is 
also submitted with the data file to the CDMO, sent also as a text file (text 
only with line breaks).  Scott Orringer is responsible for this task of entry 
verification with the analyses of suspect and anomalous data.  Michele Dionne 
supervises, proofs and answers questions with the evaluation of suspect and 
anomalous data.


3.  Research objectives:

	The Webhannet River estuary is located in proximity to heavily used 
beaches in Wells, Maine.  It has a shoreline that is highly developed with 
residential and commercial structures.  The estuary receives water from a 14 sq. 
mi. watershed that is well forested.  We are measuring variations in hydrologic 
variables in the Webhannet River estuary at the head of tide and at the inlet.  
Data from head of tide will integrate surface and ground water inputs (from both 
point and non-point sources) from the freshwater watershed into the estuary.  
Data from the inlet will integrate surface and ground water inputs from the 
freshwater watershed and the estuarine watershed.  Differences in data between 
the head of tide and the inlet will indicate inputs from the estuarine portion 
of the watershed (on the ebb tide), and inputs from the Gulf of Maine on the 
flood tide.  The instruments will track runoff events via salinity, and will 
measure pollutant-carrying sediment particles via turbidity.  Our working 
hypothesis is that the freshwater watershed is the primary source of sediment 
and therefore potential NPS pollutants in the estuary.  These two variables will 
indicate the potential for non-point source pollutants to enter the estuary, and 
whether they are of upland, estuarine or Gulf of Maine origin.  Other variables 
measured by the data loggers (DO, temperature, pH, specific conductivity, and 
water level) will provide important baseline data to track changes in the 
estuary's physico-chemical parameters over the long term.  These variables can 
be affected by changes in human water use, and by natural or human induced 
changes in inlet and river channel morphology, climate, and organic loadings.  
The inlet site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term 
monitoring site.  The head of tide site is relatively unimpacted, located just 
east of the Route One bridge, and is our "roving" site.


4.  Research Methods*†

	The Wells NERR YSI monitoring program began in April 1995 at one site 
(head of tide site-HT) and May 1995 at a second site (inlet site-IN) in the 
Webhannet River estuary.  The two data loggers are installed with bottom 
moorings, as described below.  Both data loggers have 1/4 inch black vector mesh 
placed on the outside (using rubber bands) of the sonde guard to prevent fouling 
and unwanted animals.  All deployment structures (PVC tubes) described below are 
labeled with the Wells NERR information.

*The YSI telemetry unit at the inlet site (IN) began reading on 3/16/98 at 
10:30:00.  Before this date/time (from Wells NERR 1997 Metadata):
The inlet site (IN) deployment methods changed starting on 12/19/97 at 10:30.  
The YSI telemetry unit was installed to this site.  A 23 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube was installed against a dock piling.  Four steel flat bars 
with bolts were used to attach this 23 foot PVC tube against the dock piling.  A 
3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer was glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to 
allow the sonde to sit exactly 1.0 meter (3.28  ft) off the bottom.  Several 
vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A PVC threaded cap 
screws in to the threaded top of the PVC tube, also for security.  A hole was 
created in the PVC cap to allow the sonde to hook up with the telemetry unit 
using the 50 foot cable.  The collection of data parameters at the inlet (IN) 
site are slightly different then at the head of tide (HT) site, due to 
the telemetry unit installation.  This is explained in the Wells 1998 metadata 
[BELOW],  as we didn't actually begin the telemetry unit data collection until 
1998; we just installed the new 23 foot PVC tube (see YSI's Eco-Watch Users 
Guide).  Thus, the actual data parameter collection from 12/19/97 10:30 to 
12/31/97 23:30 was the same as prior to that.
 
The inlet site (IN) deployment methods are different than the other three sites, 
due to the installation of a YSI telemetry unit.  A 23 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube was installed against a dock piling.  Four steel flat bars 
with bolts were used to attach this 23 foot PVC tube against the dock piling.  A 
3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer was glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to 
allow the sonde to sit exactly 1.0 meter (3.28  ft) off the bottom.  Several 
vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A PVC threaded cap 
screws in to the threaded top of the PVC tube, also for security.  A hole was 
created in the PVC cap to allow the sonde to hook up with the telemetry unit 
using the 50 foot cable.  The collection of data parameters at the inlet (IN) 
site are slightly different then at the roving (HT) site, due to the telemetry 
unit installation.  Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen due 
to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane and probe 
fouling.  Battery power is not needed anymore within the sonde itself (although, 
battery power is needed during calibrations and downloading) at the time of 
deployment at this site because of the telemetry unit's solar batter power.  
Measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and turbidity are recorded at 30 minute 
intervals throughout the deployment period.  Time, date, and battery 
voltage are no longer programmed to be recorded by the sonde, since these 
parameters are already programmed with the Eco-Watch Program (see YSI's Eco-
Watch Users Guide).

	The other site, head of tide (HT), is deployed similarly, except for sonde 
height off the bottom (see below).  This site uses a 5 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube.  The PVC tube is attached to a 12 foot, heavy steel sign 
post using a stainless steel bolt at the bottom of the tube, a stainless steel 
cable wrap at the top, and several thick electrical cable ties in between.  
The steel sign post was pounded in about 7 feet into the river bottom, such that 
the bottom of the PVC tube was flat on the river bottom.  The PVC tube has one 3 
by 1.5 inch PVC transducer glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to allow 
the sonde to sit exactly at a certain height off the bottom (see below).  
Several vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A flotation buoy is 
tied to the PVC tubes incase the deployment structure ever gets dislodged.  The 
deployment depth for the head of tide site (HT) is such that the probe-end of 
the data logger is secured 0.30 meters (1.0 ft) off the bottom.	

	Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen for the data sonde 
due to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane, probe 
fouling, and limited battery power.  Measurements of temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and 
turbidity are recorded at 30 minute intervals throughout the deployment period.
	After the deployment period, the data logger is brought back into the 
Wells Reserve Laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and calibration.  These 
procedures are carried out to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.  
Calibration standards are needed and used for only specific conductivity (10 
mS/cm), pH (buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10), and turbidity (100 NTU).  
Conductivity and pH standards are purchased from Fisher Scientific.  Turbidity 
standards are purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc. (Redwood City, CA).  
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced and sit 6-24 hours before each 
deployment.  After approximately 6-24 hours of down time for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration, the YSI Data logger is redeployed for another 
sampling period.  Also, with our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the 
amount of time of missing data from calibrations and maintenance for this site.

†Note:  The Wells NERR two Drakes Island sites (see previous metatdata) are 
being monitored, but we are using the data for another project (CICEET-Wells 
Harbor dredge; see Wells NERR metadata 1999) and not collecting the dissolved 
oxygen or percent saturation parameters.
	

5.  Site location and character    

	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York County, 
within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and faces the Atlantic 
Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 miles) south of Portland, 
Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, Massachusetts.  The Reserve 
encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of Maine coastline of tidally-flushed 
wetlands, riparian and transitional upland fields and forests within the Little 
River Estuary and the larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in 
the sandy glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers 
empty into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles along 
the Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river's inlet are double spit barrier 
beaches attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system is approximately 5 sq. 
km and is composed of large intertidal marshes (predominantly S. patens and S. 
alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed 
for the Webhannet River estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 
streams, brooks or creeks which enter the estuary.  These tributaries flow 
across sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the impermeable sandy 
muds of the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The Webhannet River is 
connected to the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a spring tidal prism of 
28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). The force and volume of tidal action affect the 
salinity level of both rivers.  In the Wells region, the annual mean wave 
height is almost 20 inches.  The estuarine system is dominated by semi-diurnal 
tides having a range of 8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into 
both estuaries is moderate to low (on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), 
especially in the summer, because of the rivers' relatively small drainage areas 
and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The relatively low flows from these 
two rivers taken in with the 20 inch per year average runoff of the area 
surrounding the estuaries combine to form a fresh water flow which is dwarfed by 
tidal flushing.  Twelve-foot tides dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet 
estuary, which has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet estuary, 
fed by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and greatly 
developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for comparison with the 
relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land use of the Webhannet estuary 
include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh water, and tidal marsh; a total of 
63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 18.6% for developed land (compared to a 
total of 5.7% development in the Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 
1997).
	There are two sampling sites in the Webhannet River estuary.  These are 
located at the head of tide and at the inlet.  The tidal range at each of these 
sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.   
	The head of tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just 
downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 
deg 17' 54.25227" Latitude, 70 deg 35' 13.82728" Longitude).  Route One is used 
heavily with traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  
This site has soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide 
depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean 
of 3.6 ppt.  These head waters of the Webhannet are relatively undeveloped.  
This site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is our 
"roving" site.
	The inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the 
Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19' 12.44804" Latitude, 70 deg 33' 13.82728" 
Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an extensive wetland/salt 
marsh area which is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most 
recently dredged in 1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing 
and recreational boats.  The mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the 
Atlantic Ocean.  This channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a 
predominately sand substrate and is characterized by strong current during 
incoming and outgoing tides.  The salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean 
of 31 ppt.  The inlet site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is 
our long-term monitoring site.

6.  Data collection period:

	The Webhannet River head of tide (HT) site data collection was re-deployed 
(after being pulled in December 1995, December 1996, and December 1997) on April 
1, 13:00 and pulled December 31, 11:00 for the winter months to prevent ice 
damage.  This site gets a large amount of ice coverage from December through 
late March.
	The Webhannet River inlet (IN) site data collection began May 29, 1995, 
13:00.  The IN datalogger is ongoing throughout the year and is considered our 
long-term monitoring site, as this site remains relatively ice-free.
	
7.  Associated researchers and projects

	Ongoing research at the Wells Reserve is designed to address issues of 
concern to the Gulf of Maine management community; sea level rise, beach 
erosion, coastal water quality and nutrient enrichment, coastal habitat 
value, habitat restoration of shellfish and finfish, marsh plant community 
dynamics, and plant-soil-nutrient relationships.  Active research topics 
include:
	• rates of accretion of salt marsh peat
	• hydrologic and ecological response of impounded marshes to restoration
	• assessment of shellfish resources in the Webhannet River flats
	• assessment of resident and migratory fish use of Little River estuary
	• use of large wading birds as indicators of salt marsh habitat health
	• watershed nutrient loading to Little and Webhannet River estuaries
	• linkage between estuarine nutrient enrichment and oxygen dynamics 
	throughout coastal 	Maine
	• climatic versus competitive control of salt marsh plant communities
	• effects of climate on salt marsh plant phenology and phenotype
	• associations between marsh plant distribution, soil nutrients, and soil 
	type

Although many of these projects are ongoing some of the findings to date are:
• Impounded salt marshes can respond quickly to restored tidal flow, with early 
colonization by salt marsh vegetation and by resident and migratory marsh 
fishes.	
• Seed clam density declines with distance from the Webhannet River inlet, 
indicating an external as opposed to an internal source of recruitment to the 
clam population.  There is a small but significant relationship between density 
and sediment organic matter.
• Juvenile striped bass utilize the Little River estuary as a food resource; 
diet analysis indicates a preference for sand shrimp.
• The Reserve's estuaries appear to be nitrogen limited; primary nitrogen source 
is ocean water.  Nutrients from fresh surface water influence nutrient 
concentrations in the upper estuary.  Ground water may be a significant source 
of nitrogen in the upper Webhannet River estuary.
• Maine's estuaries and embayments show no serious oxygen depletion, with a few 
exceptions.  Dissolved oxygen and nitrogen levels are related to freshwater 
runoff, indicating that activities in the watershed can influence the 
estuaries even in the face of the high tidal flushing rates typical of Maine's 
estuaries.
• Salt marsh plant phenology varies significantly between Wells NERR and 
Prudence Island NERR; trends suggest possible genetic variation within species.
• Soil nitrogen concentrations are directly related to forbe distribution on the 
Reserve's salt marshes.


	The Research Program's volunteer water quality monitoring program (W.E.T.) 
has been monitoring fecal coliform contamination and other water quality 
parameters in the estuaries since 1991.  W.E.T. (Watershed Evaluation Team) was 
established to characterize and monitor the aquatic environment of the Little 
and Webhannet River estuaries.  This program allows students from local schools 
and volunteers to participate in "hands-on" scientific research and management 
activities at the Reserve.  Information yielded by this effort is valuable as 
baseline data for research conducted at the Reserve and may help in guiding 
current management priorities.  Reserve staff with W.E.T. volunteers and 
students, working with the Town of Wells and the Maine Department of Marine 
Resources (DMR), have recently opened selected shellfish beds (for two years 
now) in the Webhannet River after nine years of closure.  This was a direct 
result of monitoring fecal coliform contamination (and other water quality 
parameters), which is the major source of non-point source pollution in southern 
Maine.
	University of New Hampshire researchers completed a year long monitoring 
project measuring the volume, nutrient concentrations, and total suspended 
solids of freshwater discharge into the Webhannet River estuary, relating these 
inputs to precipitation, and measuring their effects on estuarine water quality; 
using a hydrolab.  Research staff and students have completed a four year study 
of hydrology and vegetation of a degraded Webhannet River marsh recovering from 
roadway impoundment after restoration of tidal flow.  In June of 1994, Reserve 
research staff and students completed an 18 month survey of larval fish 
distribution and abundance in the Wells Reserve's estuaries and in the near-
shore waters of Wells Bay. University of New Hampshire researchers are working 
with eelgrass beds in Wells Embayment to develop criteria for siting and 
evaluating eel grass restoration projects.  Both salt marsh and eelgrass are 
thought to be important habitats for many Gulf of Maine fishes. University of 
Maine Machias is collaborating with Reserve staff to determine the status of the 
soft-shell clam resource in the Reserve's estuaries.  Reserve staff are working 
with the Maine Dept. of Environmental Protection to survey the dissolved oxygen 
status of 25 estuaries throughout Maine, using data sondes to measure oxygen 
depletion as an indicator of non-point source pollution (Coastal Hypoxia Study).


RESEARCH PROJECTS 1998:  During 1998, the research program at the wells reserve 
will address questions regarding management of water quality, finfish and 
shellfish, and other wildlife  as they apply to marsh-dominated estuaries and 
their watersheds throughout the Gulf of Maine.  

Softshell Clam Enhancement:  This is a continuing project in collaboration with 
the town of Wells, the University of Maine Machias, and the Beals Island 
Shellfish Hatchery.  The long term goal of the project is to understand the 
factors (both ecological and human-related) that determine clam productivity.  
During 1998 we will be conducting experiments with seed clam to determine their 
growth and survival in different conditions throughout the Webhannet River 
Estuary.  

Estuarine Fish Distribution:  Since 1992 we have been surveying fishes in both 
the Little River and Webhannet River estuaries, using a variety of techniques.  
Our long term goal is to quantify the value of marsh-dominated estuaries and 
their watersheds for the survival, growth and reproduction of Gulf of Maine 
fishes.  In 1998 we will be using beach seines to track winter flounder growth 
in both the Webhannet and Little rivers.  We will also complete sample 
processing and data analysis for previous surveys of larval fish and juvenile 
and adult pelagic fish.

Estuarine Water Quality:  The Wells NERR conducts long term monitoring of 
physical, chemical and biological water quality parameters.  These data are used 
to detect improvements and declines in water resources that can result 
from changes in land use and other human activities.  We use automated 
instruments deployed in the estuaries and a bimonthly sampling program to 
measure water quality.  Samples are analyzed in our on-site laboratory.

Wading Bird Monitoring:  Wading birds are top predators in the salt marsh food 
web, and depend on the marshes for food.  Changes in wading bird populations are 
potential indicators of changes in the quality of salt marsh habitat.  We have 
been monitoring the number and location of great blue herons and snowy egrets in 
the Reserve's marshes since 1991, and they have been fairly stable over that 
time.
  
Salt Marsh Restoration:  The Wells NERR has been instrumental in identifying and 
measuring the damaging effects of tidal restriction (due to roads and culverts) 
on salt marsh ecosystems.  We are involved in long-term monitoring of 
several salt marsh tidal restoration sites.  In 1998 we will collect data on 
marsh plant communities at one of these sites on the Webhannet River.

Coastal Watershed Land Use:  In 1998 we are beginning a new project to document 
and map preserved lands in southern coastal Maine.  We will be collecting 
information on the types and location of protected lands from a variety of 
state, local and private partners, especially land trusts and conservation 
commissions.  The information will be compiled using a geographic information 
system.  The data will be displayed as maps at a number of public forums to 
stimulate the development of forward thinking habitat protection strategies.

In addition to the Reserve-sponsored projects outlined above, numerous visiting 
investigators will be involved in on-site research.  Topics include: the effects 
of land use, sea level, and climate on estuarine productivity; the relationship 
between soil nutrients and plant community patterns; the influence of soil 
salinity on plant community interactions; the effect of tidal restriction on 
marsh peat accretion; the comparative ecology of fringe marshes and back barrier 
marshes; habitat use by upland birds, and the ecology of lyme disease.

10.  Data anomalies:

January, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until April.
Inlet: 
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 1/14 11:00-1/15 14:00 (logging period recorded 12 anomalies), possibly due 
to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
No pH data from 1/13 15:30 to 1/21 11:30 due to a pH probe crash.  The pH 
immediately dropped to a value of 1.69 (outside the probe range) on 1/13 15:30 
from the overall data record, and then thereafter displayed erratic readings and 
"noise".  These data were suspect and deleted.  The post-cal was unreliable and 
the probe could not be recalibrated upon return to the lab.

February, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until April.
Inlet: 
There were two pH data spikes on 2/18 9:30 (3.36) and 11:00 (3.18) that are not 
consistent with the overall data record.  
These data were suspect but not deleted, although these readings appear totally 
unreasonable, as the post-cal was reliable and the probe could be recalibrated 
upon return to the lab.

March, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until April.
Inlet: 
DO deleted from 3/16 10:30 to 11:00; first few records are low compared to rest 
the rest of deployment.  Membrane may have still been settling.  
The following were several "roll over" episodes (>1000 NTU), with a range of 
high positive turbidity spikes (<1000 NU) that were not consistent with the 
overall data record.  Beginning on 3/27 14:00, these 22 turbidity anomalies 
(range from 47.3 to 1284.8; with eleven values >1000, and a mean of 936.7) were 
observed immediately increasing to the "roll over" readings of >1000 NTU and 
then falling back down to the overall data record before immediately increasing 
to these large positive values 
.  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these 
values were bad.
3/27	14:00	1273.9; 14:30 1275.3; 15:30 878.1; 16:00	1276.6; 18:00	357.4;

April, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report.
Inlet:
No data on 4/18 1:00-2:00; due to a data gap.  Logger did not record data within 
this time range, possibly due to an overwrite of data.
No turbidity data from 4/23 14:00 to 4/30 23:30 due to a turbidity probe 
malfunction.
The following are episodes (44 readings) of low DOsat (range 12.8 to 60.6; mean 
of 27.29 percent) and DOmg (range 1.38 to 6.23; mean of 2.784 mg/l) during 
several low tide fluctuations; beginning with the 4/23 14:00 deployment, that 
were not consistent with the overall data record (at high tide the readings 
returned to the consistency of the overall data record).  These suspect data 
were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.

	5/31 17:30-20:00
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 5/27 0:30 to 5/31 23:30 
due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe malfunction.  All DOmg 
and DOsat data, jumped from 5.7 mg and 66.3 percent to 8.0 and 96, respectively, 
until reaching a peak of 34.9 mg and 348.2 percent on 5/27 3:30; thereafter 
decreasing sharply until reaching values of 0.0 followed by negative values.  
These data were suspect and deleted.

June, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 6/1 0:00 through 6/28 
10:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe malfunction from 
the previous deployment (5/27 0:30).  These data were suspect and deleted.
The following were high positive turbidity spikes that were not consistent with 
the overall data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not

July, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report.
Inlet:
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 7/1 17:30-7/31 19:30 (logging period recorded 524 anomalies), possibly due 
to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following are suspect DOsat and DOmg data, due to three small, negative 
values recorded are outside the listed range of the dissolved oxygen probe.  
These suspect values were not consistent with the overall data record, and were 
deleted on the basis of absolute data rejection.  Other parameters, the 
dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.

Head of Tide:
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 9/1 0:00-9/28 0:00 (logging period recorded 238 anomalies), possibly due 
to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following are shallow positive depth data (606 values) beginning on 9/1 0:00 
(range of 0.00 to 0.09 m; mean of 0.04 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be 
underwater as other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted:

There were two high positive turbidity spikes on 9/7 1:30 (295.9) and 9/13 1:00 
(96.5) that were not consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect 
data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.
Inlet: 
No data from 9/1 0:00 to 9/21 13:30 due to a telemetry malfunction, including a 
telemetry battery crash (continued from the crash observed beginning on 8/24 
11:00).
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 9/21 14:00-9/30 23:00 (logging period recorded 377 anomalies), possibly 
due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following are episodes (129 readings) of low DOsat (range 0.8 to 58.2; mean 
of 32.2 percent) and DOmg (range 0.1 to 4.9; mean of 2.7 mg/l) during several 
low tide fluctuations; beginning at 9/21 15:30, that were not consistent with 
the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to the consistency 
of the overall data record).  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values are bad.

The following are suspect DOsat and DOmg data, due to three small, negative 
values recorded are outside the listed range of the dissolved oxygen probe.  
These suspect values were not consistent with the overall data record, and were 
deleted on the basis of absolute data rejection.  Other parameters, the 
dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.

October, 1998 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
There were suspect data (all parameters) beginning on 10/9 1:00 through 10/12 
14:30 due to a powerful storm event (strong winds, heavy rain, flooding, coastal 
erosion along with astronomical high tides).  All parameters returned to normal 
except for DO mg/l and DO percent saturation that seemed to flatline over 100 
percent for the remainder of the month.  This suspect data was not deleted, as 
post calibrations checked out normal.  (The full description from the NCDC 
website of this storm event is listed in Section 12).

The following were several continuous "roll over" episodes, with a range of high 
positive turbidity spikes that were not consistent with the overall data record.  
Beginning on 10/10 8:30 and continuing through 10/12 14:00, these 108 turbidity 
anomalies (range from 2.6 to 2007.5; with seven values >1000 plus two values 
>2000, and a mean of 322.78) were observed climbing to the "roll over" readings 
of >1000 NTU and then falling back down to the overall data record before 
immediately increasing to these large positive values .  These suspect data were 
not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values were bad:
10/10	8:30-10/12 14:00
The following are shallow negative depth data (14 values) beginning on 10/1 
10:00 (range of -0.007 to -0.05 m; mean of -.036 m).  Sonde probes suspected to 
be underwater as other parameters check out normal.  These data were 
not deleted:
	10/1 10:00-16:30
The following are shallow positive depth data (43 values) beginning on 10/1 
17:00 (range of 0.00 to 0.095 m; mean of 0.04 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be 
underwater as other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted:
10/1	17:00-18:30, 21:30-23:30
10/2	0:00-7:30, 10:00-18:30

Inlet: 
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 10/1 2:00-10/31 23:30 (logging period recorded 916 anomalies), possibly 
due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following are 16 suspect DOsat and DOmg data, due to small, negative values 
recorded are outside the listed range of the dissolved oxygen probe.  These 
suspect values were not consistent with the overall data record, and were 
deleted on the basis of absolute data rejection.  Other parameters, the 
dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.

of 14.03 percent) and DOmg (range 0.06 to 5.21; mean of 1.33 mg/l) during 
several low tide fluctuations; beginning at 10/1 0:00, that were not consistent 
with the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to the 
consistency of the overall data record).  These suspect data were not deleted, 
as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.

November, 1998 Sampling Period 
Head of Tide:
The following was a "roll over" episode, with a range of three high positive 
turbidity spikes >1000 NTU that were not consistent with the overall data 
record; and there was no climb in turbidity values toward three high "roll over" 
spikes.  These 6 turbidity values were observed from 11/2 15:00 (1088.5) 
continuous through 11/2 17:30 (87.6), and with a mean of 919.9 and a range from 
87.6 to 1976.4 NTU.  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not

There were three high positive turbidity spikes on 11/2 18:30 (140.0), 20:30 
(255.1), and 21:00 (119.7) that were not consistent with the overall data 
record.  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that 
these values are bad.
Inlet:
Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 11/1 3:30-11/19 12:30 (logging period recorded 637 anomalies), possibly 
due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following are episodes (246 readings) of low DOsat (range 0.4 to 52.8; mean 
of 7.843 percent) and DOmg (range 0.04 to 5.26; mean of 0.781 mg/l) during 
several low tide fluctuations; beginning at 11/1 0:00, that were not consistent 
with the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to the 
consistency of the overall data record).  These suspect data were 
not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.

12.  Other Remarks/Notes:

•*The YSI telemetry unit at the inlet site (IN) began reading on 3/16/98 at 
10:30:00.  Before this date/time (from Wells NERR 1997 Metadata):
The inlet site (IN) deployment methods changed starting on 12/19/97 at 10:30.  
The YSI telemetry unit was installed to this site.  A 23 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube was installed against a dock piling.  Four steel flat bars 
with bolts were used to attach this 23 foot PVC tube against the dock piling.  A 
3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer was glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to 
allow the sonde to sit exactly 1.0 meter (3.28  ft) off the bottom.  Several 
vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A PVC threaded cap 
screws in to the threaded top of the PVC tube, also for security.  A hole was 
created in the PVC cap to allow the sonde to hook up with the telemetry unit 
using the 50 foot cable.  The collection of data parameters at the inlet (IN) 
site are slightly different then at the head of tide (HT) site, due to 
the telemetry unit installation.  This is explained in the Wells 1998 metadata 
[BELOW], as we didn't actually begin the telemetry unit data collection until 
1998; we just installed the new 23 foot PVC tube (see YSI's Eco-Watch Users 
Guide).  Thus, the actual data parameter collection from 12/19/97 10:30 to 
12/31/97 23:30 was the same as prior to that.  Two to four week variable 
sampling periods were chosen due to limitations created by the life of the 
dissolved oxygen membrane and probe fouling.  Battery power is not needed 
anymore within the sonde itself (although, battery power is needed during 
calibrations and downloading) at the time of deployment at this site because of 
the telemetry unit's solar batter power.  Measurements of temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and 
turbidity are recorded at 30 minute intervals throughout the deployment period.  
Time, date, and battery voltage are no longer programmed to be recorded by the 
sonde, since these parameters are already programmed with the Eco-Watch Program 
(see YSI's Eco-Watch Users Guide).

•There were significant rain storms during the June HT deployment; which could 
be the reason for the observed high turbidity 
values.
 
•With our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the amount of time of missing 
data from calibrations and maintenance for all sites.  Some months have no 
missing data from the use of this extra sonde.

•There were suspect data at the head of tide site (HT) of (all parameters) 
beginning on 10/9 1:00 through 10/12 14:30 due to a powerful storm event (strong 
winds, heavy rain, flooding, coastal erosion along with astronomical 
high tides).  All parameters returned to normal except for DO mg/l and DO 
percent saturation that seemed to flatline over 100 percent for the remainder of 
the month.  This suspect data was not deleted, as post calibrations checked out 
normal.

 Description:
 A moist southeast flow from the Atlantic developed ahead of an intensifying 
low pressure center off the mid-Atlantic coast on Friday, October 9 and caused 
heavy rain to spread over southern Maine during the day. The low moved slowly 
northeastward during the 10th and 11th, then gradually moved east of the area 
on the 12th. The storm caused strong winds, heavy rain, flooding, and coastal 
erosion in parts of southern Maine. The southeasterly flow ahead of the storm 
combined with its slow movement brought a persistent flow of moisture laden 
air from the Atlantic into the southwestern part of the state. The heavy 
precipitation caused rivers, streams, and low areas to flood during the day
 Saturday, October 10. In addition to the heavy rainfall, high winds caused 
large and powerful wind driven waves, which, in combination with 
astronomically high tides, caused erosion along sections of the coast. 
Rainfall amounts during the period in Cumberland and York Counties ranged from 
about 5 inches in extreme
 southwestern York County and northwestern York and Cumberland Counties to 
more than 10 inches in coastal sections of Cumberland County. South Portland 
Pubic Works reported 11.89 inches of precipitation at South Portland High 
School during the four-day period. The heavy rainfall caused numerous small 
rivers and
 streams in Cumberland and York Counties to flood roadways. Many roads were 
closed due to the flood waters and/or the damage caused by the flood waters. 
In Freeport, a 90 foot long, 14 foot diameter steel culvert located where Mill 
Creek flows beneath Flying Creek Road was damaged. The Presumpscot River was 
above flood stage from about 12:30 pm Saturday through about 9:30 pm Sunday 
evening. The Presumpscot River crested at about 20.88 feet at about 9 pm
 Saturday evening, just under 6 feet above the 15 foot flood stage. In 
Kennebunk, the combination of astronomically high tides and the large waves 
generated by the storm undermined 230 feet of seawall. The concrete and steel 
wall slid forward and dropped onto the beach, allowing washout under Great 
Hill Road and loss of the sidewalk. Both Cumberland and York Counties were 
declared federal
 disaster areas by the President, making them eligible for federal aid. Strong 
winds, rough seas, and high astronomical tides caused several boats in the 
mid-coast region to break from their moorings. In Rockland, a 20-foot sailboat 
and a 25-foot sailboat grounded on rocks. At the southern end of Owls Head, a 
35 foot boat used for urchin diving was destroyed when it hit the rocks.
