2. Entry verification:


Data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI and graphs are produced and examined 
using the Ecowatch program software. Data are also uploaded in a comma-delimited 
format from the YSI to the PC. Removing headers, footers, and spaces on a PC in 
Excel 5.0 creates edited files. Suspect data are evaluated using QA/QC excel 5.0 
macros (version 3.0) from CDMO. Missing data from YSI maintenance are inserted 
into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.). Edited files are merged to 
create one full month of data. Edited and raw data are archived at Elkhorn 
Slough NERR then uploaded to CDMO NERR server. John Haskins is responsible for 
the editing and archiving of data.

3. Research objectives:

Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over a three to four week period at 
three sites in Elkhorn Slough. One site South Marsh (SM) is in a relatively 
unimpacted side channel of the slough and the second, Azevedo Pond (AP), is in a 
pond that receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from an adjoining strawberry 
field. The third site, North Marsh (NM), was added in April 1999 and is located 
in an area where there is both agricultural and non-agricultural runoff. The 
purpose of this research is to identify the base parameters for Elkhorn Slough 
by using South Marsh as the control site and the other two sites are impacted 
sites and monitored for possible future problems.  


4. Research methods: 

The Elkhorn Slough water-monitoring program began in July 1995. All three sites 
described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI deployment at SM, a 
20-foot length of 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the slough to house the 
YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the pipe's surface area and 
to allow water flow across the YSI. The pipe was positioned vertically in the 
slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom sediments and the other end 
secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) 
above the bottom. This setup is exactly the same at North Marsh.  Prior to YSI 
deployment at AP, a supportive framework of rope and PVC was placed at the site 
to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) above 
the pond bottom. Every half hour over a 30-day period, measurements of specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, depth, turbidity, and pH 
are recorded. 30-day periods were chosen due to the limitations of the dissolved 
oxygen membrane and battery power. At the end of each 30-day period, the YSI is 
brought back into the lab for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Data is 
downloaded on a PC and graphs are printed using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde 
body and probes are cleaned.  DO membrane is changed and allowed to re-
equilibrate for at least eight hours before calibration.  Calibration is 
performed as outlined in the YSI manual.  Buffer solutions of pH 7 and pH 10 are 
purchased from a scientific supply house and used for two-point calibration of 
the pH probe.  A salinity standard of 31.892 ppt was used for calibration of the 
conductivity probe and in the beginning of July 1999 conductivity standard of 53 
mS/cm was used. The turbidity probe is calibrated using a two-point calibration 
with DI water and 100 NTU standard. As of July 1998 a new YSI is calibrated in 
the lab in order to replace the previous one in the field. This eliminates the 
loss of data due to cleaning and calibration. QA/QC is done according to the 
CDMO manual by John Haskins using the macros provided by the CDMO.  Data are 
then looked over more rigorously to identify and document anomalies and missing 
data.  


5. Site location and character:

Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in Central 
California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay near Moss 
Landing, California. There are three sampling sites.  SM (South Marsh) (36( 49' 
04.72" N, 121 44' 21.95" W) is in a side channel of the slough and is relatively 
unimpacted by anthropogenic influences.  The YSI is located on the side of a 
bank in one of the secondary slough channels.  AP (Azevedo Pond) (36( 50' 44.41" 
N, 121( 45' 13.50" W) is in a pond, which receives fertilizer and pesticide 
runoff from a strawberry field in year-round production. The YSI is located 
about 10m from a culvert connecting the pond to the slough. NM (North Marsh) 
(36( 50' 04.68"N, 121( 44' 18.19"W) is located in between South Marsh and 
Azevedo Pond. This site is impacted by both agricultural and urban runoff. 
	Azevedo Pond ranged in temperature between 3.5 C and 35 C in the summer 
and averaged 16 C. Salinity ranged from 1 ppt during rain events to 60 ppt 
during summer evaporation and averaged 47 ppt. DO% ranged from 0% to 302% and 
averaged 84%. The tidal range is approximately 1 m, and the depth is 
approximately 1.5m. PH ranged from 6.9 to 9.8 with an average of 7.9. Turbidity 
ranged from 0 to 676 NTU with an average of 13. The bottom habitat is fine 
sediments covered in ulva and other benthic algae. Freshwater input is heavy 
during the winter and is from the neighboring agricultural field. South Marsh 
ranged in temperature between 9.8 C and 23.7 C in the summer and averaged 15.8 
C. Salinity ranged from 1 ppt during rain events to 35 ppt during summer 
evaporation and averaged 30 ppt. DO% ranged from 2% to 184% and averaged 86%. 
The tidal range is approximately 3 m and the depth is 3.5 m. PH ranged from 7.2 
to 8.6 with an average of 7.9. Turbidity ranged from 0 to 134 NTU with an 
average of 12 NTU. The bottom habitat is slightly larger grain sediments because 
of the higher current area. Freshwater inputs are from surrounding upland area 
and only occur during the winter. North Marsh ranged in temperature between 8.5 
C and 29.4 C in the summer and averaged 17.6 C. Salinity ranged from 12 ppt 
during rain events to 45 ppt during summer evaporation and averaged 33 ppt. 
DO% ranged from 0% to 363% and averaged 81%. The tidal range is approximately 1 
m and depth is approximately 1.5m. PH ranged from 6.2 to 9.4 with an average of 
8.0. Turbidity ranged from 0 to 161 NTU with an average of 11 NTU. The bottom 
habitat is fine sediments covered in ulva and other benthic algae. Two small 
creeks run into this marsh and only run in the winter.




6. Data collection period:
Sampling at South Marsh and Azevedo Pond began simultaneously at the end of June 
1995 and data collection is ongoing. North Marsh began sampling on April 15 
1999.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
The following are brief descriptions of research projects in Elkhorn Slough as 
of June 1999.
	Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough 
Foundation have had an ongoing program to monitor estuarine water quality in the 
central Monterey Bay region since 1988.  Currently, 24 stations are monitored 
monthly for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, nitrate, 
ammonium, and dissolved inorganic phosphate concentrations.  Two of these 
stations on the Reserve are about 400 m from the SM site.  Data collection began 
at these two stations in September 1989.  A monthly monitoring station is also 
located at Azevedo Pond within 10 m of the YSI deployment.  Monthly data from 
the Azevedo Pond are available from March 1992.
	The University of California Santa Cruz Agroecology Program has an ongoing 
project to examine the effects of agricultural production on an adjacent 
wetland.  Matthew Werner, Marc Los Huertos, Felecia Rein, Sean Swezey, Mark 
Silberstein, Andrew De Vogelaere, Ron Tjeerdema have been the principal 
investigators.

South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended May 09 
1400 and the second began May 09 1430. 

Salinity and conductivity data are suspect from the beginning of the month 
through the end of the deployment May 09 1400 due most likely to drift. Data 
were not deleted. These data are also suspect from the beginning of the second 
deployment through the end of the month because there is a general decreasing 
trend as the probe is drifting. Data were not deleted. 

PH data are suspect for this month because the second deployment had 
significantly higher values than the first deployment. This may have been due to 
drift from the first deployment. Data were not deleted.

Turbidity data suspect during these times due to negative and/or zero values:
May 08     01:00

05 1700 and the second one began July 05 1730 and ended July 25 0830 and the 
third one began July 25 0900.

Salinity and conductivity values are suspect at the beginning of the month to 
the end of the first deployment Jul 05 1700 because the readings were mismatched 
from the first deployment to the second. 

pH data were suspect towards the end of the second deployment because probe was 
beginning to drift. Data were not deleted.

Data for this month were compiled from three deployments. The first ended August 
08 1400, the second one began Aug 08 1430 and ended Aug 28 1500, the third one 
began Aug 28 1500.

PH data are suspect from the beginning of the month to the end of the first of 
the deployment Aug 08 1400 because post calibration was slightly off and the 
next deployment saw higher values. PH data was also suspect towards the end of 
the second deployment because values made a significant decrease then were 
muted. Data was deleted Aug 23 1730-Aug 28 1530.

South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Aug 15 
1000 and the second one began Aug 15 1030. 

Salinity and conductivity data are suspect towards the end of the first 
deployment because of a discrepancy of the end of the first deployment and the 
beginning of the first deployment. This was probably due to drift of probe 
values but it is not possible to determine when it began. These data were not 
deleted. 

PH data are also suspect at the end of the first deployment because values at 
the beginning of the second deployment are approximately 0.2 pH units below 
those of the end of the first deployment. Data were not deleted.

September 1-30, 2000 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Sept 05

Turbidity data were deleted from the beginning of the month through Sept 04 0700 
because values were erratic probably due to the wiper partially in front of the 
window. 

Turbidity data were deleted during these times because they were anomalously 
high:
Sept 07 1530

1200 and the second one began Sept 13 1230.

PH data are missing at the beginning of the second deployment Sept 13 1030 
through the end of the month because values trend to a slow gradual drift to 
higher pH values.

Turbidity were negative and/or zero during the following times:
09/18/00	14:00
09/21/00	16:00
09/22/00	08:00
Data were not deleted

Depth data are suspect for the extent of the month because values from the first 
deployment and the second deployment are non-congruous due either to drift or 
poor calibration. Data were not deleted.

October 1-31, 2000 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
Data for this month were compiled from three deployments. The first ended Oct 9 
1430, the second one began Oct 10 1500 and ended Oct 30 1600, the third one

Turbidity was deleted because they were anomalously high Oct 03 2300, Oct 09 
1430, Oct 22 2130 and Oct 26 0630-0700 due to debris.

North Marsh 
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Oct 25 
1400 and the second one began Oct 26 1330.

Salinity and specific conductivity data are suspect beginning of the second 
deployment Oct 26 1330 through the end of the month because of suppressed data 
due to most likely a significant rain event.

PH data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment Oct 26 1330 
through the end of the month due to non-congruous readings between deployments. 

Depth data are suspect from the beginning of the second deployment Oct 26 1330 
through the end of the month because of incongruous readings between the 
deployments and readings drifting higher at the beginning of the second 
deployment.

DO% and DO mg/L are missing Oct 05 2100 through the end of the deployment Oct 25 
1400 due to probe drift.

South Marsh
Data for this month were compiled from two deployments. The first ended Oct 11 
0930 and the second one began Oct 11 1030.

Turbidity was deleted because they were anomalously high Oct 03 2300, Oct 09 
1430, Oct 22 2130 and Oct 26 0630-0700 due to debris.

North Marsh 
All data are missing from Oct 25 1430 through Oct 26 1300 due to 
calibration/replacement.

DO% and DO mg/L are missing Oct 05 2100 through the end of the deployment Oct 25 
1400 due to probe drift.

Turbidity data are missing for the entire month due to probe not being deployed 
and a probe malfunction in the second deployment. 

South Marsh
All data are missing Oct 11 1000 due to sonde replacement.

DO% and DO mg/L are missing from Oct 17 1930 through the end of the month due so 
a sharp decrease in readings probably due to a membrane puncture.

Turbidity data are missing from the beginning of the month through Oct 03 0100 
because values became high and erractic. These data are also missing beginning 
Oct 7 0000 through 0ct 10 0300 due to erratic readings. They are also deleted 
Oct 16 1830 Oct 18 1500, and Oct 20 1000 due to anomalously high readings.

PH data are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of the first 
deployment Oct 11 0930 due to probe drift previously mentioned.

November 1-31, 2000 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
All data are missing form Nov 27 1700 through Nov 28 1530 due to calibration and 
sonde replacement. 

PH data are missing for the entire month because probe was not installed for 
both deployments.

All data are missing Nov 10 1200-1230 due to OOW event.

North Marsh 

Turbidity data are missing from the beginning of the month through Nov 21 1000 
the end of the first deployment due to previously mentioned probe malfunction. 
They are also missing beginning Nov 22 0730 through the end of the month because 
probe was covered in mud beginning most likely on this date. It is also missing 
Nov 21 1030 because data was anomalously high.

DO% and DO mg/L data are missing from Nov 22 0500 through the end of the month 
because of a sharp decrease in readings from being covered in mud.

PH data are missing from Nov 21 1030 the beginning of the second deployment 
through the end of the month because values make a sharp decrease then have very 
little variability afterward probably when it was covered in mud.

Salinity data are missing Nov 23 1200 to end of month due to being found covered 
in mud upon recovery, which most likely began on this date.

South Marsh
All data are missing Nov 06 1100 because of sonde replacement.

DO% and DO mg/L data are missing for the entire month because of previously 
mentioned membrane puncture in the first deployment and poor calibration in the 
second.


Turbidity data are missing during the following times because they are 
anomalously high;
Nov 06 1130-1330, 1700
Nov 10 1100, 2000
Nov 11 0030
Nov 21 1700

PH data are missing from the beginning of the second deployment (Nov 06 1130)  
through the end of the month because probe was not deployed.

December 1-31, 2000 Sampling Period
Azevedo Pond
PH data are missing from the beginning of the month through Dec 29 1400 because 
probe was not deployed. 

All data are missing Dec 29 1430-1800 because of sonde collection and re-
calibration.

North Marsh 
Salinity, Specific conductivity, DO%, DO mg/L, pH, and Turbidity data are all 
missing from the beginning of the month through the end of the first deployment 
(Dec 19 1500) because probes were covered in mud.

Turbidity data are missing from Dec 19 1530 to the end of the month because of 
erratic readings and poor post calibration. Data were deleted.

South Marsh
DO% and DO mg/L are missing from the beginning of the month through the end of 
the first deployment Dec 05 1100 because of a poor calibration. 

Specific conductivity and salinity data are missing the beginning of the second 
deployment Dec 05 1130 through the end of the month because of probe drift.

PH data are missing from the beginning of the month through the beginning of the 
second deployment Dec 05 1100 because probe was not deployed. 

Turbidity data is missing Dec 29 1700 because it was anomalously high.

12. Other remarks/comments:
Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
