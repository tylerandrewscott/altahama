2.	Entry verification:
		The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 sonde to 
comma-delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat). The comma-delimited 
files are imported into Excel 97 where they are formatted and processed by 
macros that are supplied by the Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO). 
Various macros are designed to: 1) check data files for missing data points, 2) 
fill all cells that do not contain data with periods (.), 3) convert the data 
columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and numeric variables, 4) 
find all data that are out of acceptable range for the data logger's sensors and 
out the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) save the files as Excel 
worksheets (*.xls).
	The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete 
the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range 
expected for the site, 2) outside the range of measurements established for the 
sensors, 3) outside the range of accuracy established for the sensors, or 4) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved 
oxygen <28%).  Data are deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor 
malfunction, 2) exposure of sensors during low tide, or 3) fouling of sensors by 
aquatic organisms, debris, or sediment.  Sensor malfunctions are detected if the 
voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the sensor or 
the sensor will not calibrate.  Fouling of sensors is detected by comparing in-
situ sensor readings with measurements (see Research Methods section).  In 
addition, sensor readings that differ significantly (>10%) from standard 
solution (i.e., conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during 
deployment.  After corrections are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the 
files are exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt) to the CDMO.  Saundra 
Upchurch and Amy Whitaker Dukes are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
		Based on discussions with local Coastal Zone Management (CZM) 
personnel and our knowledge of land use within the Reserve, the South Edisto 
River drainage basin appears well suited for studying contrasting hydrographic 
conditions and land use patterns. 
One NERR water quality monitoring station has been established near Edisto Beach 
within a tributary of Big Bay Creek (BB).  Surrounded by residential and 
commercial development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is 
designated as the "treatment" site.  The second NERR water quality monitoring 
station has been situated near Bailey Island, within a tributary of St. Pierre 
Creek (SP). Urban development in the immediate area of this station has been 
sparse to date so this station will serve as our "control" site. 
	The ACE Basin water quality monitoring program began on March 3, 1995 at 
two tributaries off Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks (see Site Location and 
Character section for description of sites).  The deployment sites were 
constructed prior to the first deployment (see Research Methods section).  
Initially, the YSI electronic data loggers were programmed to measure the 
water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, water level, and 
pH at 15-minute intervals (sampling interval was changed to 30 minutes prior to 
the August 11 deployment period).  Starting April 11, 1996 deployment period, 
turbidity monitoring was added to the program.
	In July 1997, the Reserve staff initiated nutrient studies.  The objective 
of the study is to ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient 
levels near our two data logger sites. Nutrient levels are measured during a 
complete tidal cycle each month, and the samples are analyzed for ammonia, 
nitrite-nitrate, and ortho-phosphate concentrations.
	In December of 1999, we initiated a Chlorophyll Testing Pilot Study.  The 
objective of the study is to test the performance and accuracy of the 
fluorescence probes by comparison of automated data sets with field and/or lab 
measurements of total chlorophyll, as determined by standard laboratory methods. 
In December 1999, we upgraded the electronics package in two 6000 dataloggers so 
that the existing optical port could be used for turbidity and chlorophyll 
measurements.  We started measuring chlorophyll data at both sites on February 
11, 2000.  Water samples are collected at the beginning and end of each 
deployment and analyzed for chlorophyll, using the fluorometric method.  The 
study was completed in June of 2000; however, the Reserve continued to utilize 
the chlorophyll probes alternating each deployment with the turbidity probe 
until August of 2001.  

4.	Research Methods
		One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in 
the South Edisto River watershed.  The monitoring station at Big Bay Creek was 
constructed in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted vertically on 12-foot 
galvanized pole. This monitoring station was replaced in Oct of 2001 because of 
its old age, high potential for fouling to the data, and growth of oysters on 
the mount.  The new mount consists of two 5-foot PVC pipes mounted vertically on 
two overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles.  The new mount design allows for easy 
access to the YSI data sondes.  To facilitate water flow across the sensors, 
approximately one-inch diameter holes are drilled into the PVC pipes.  The pipes 
are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are approximately 0.1 meters from 
the creek bottom.  
In 1997, the St. Pierre Creek station was modified: the PVC pipe is mounted 
horizontally in a pyramid-shaped cage (2.5 ft long x 1.5 ft high) tethered to 
the original 12-foot galvanized pole.  Later that year, we began to put the data 
loggers in 1/8-inch mesh net bags before placing them in the PVC pipe to reduce 
damage by crabs and fish. 
 In April 2000 the St. Pierre station was moved and again modified.  The station 
was moved to the other side of the creek, and the pyramid-shaped cage was 
deployed vertically at the base of the pole. In September of 2001, the St. 
Pierre deployment mount was replaced with three 5-foot PVC pipes mounted 
vertically on two overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles. To facilitate water flow 
across the sensors, approximately one-inch diameter holes were drilled into the 
PVC pipes.  During the summer, the data loggers are left at the sites for one to 
two weeks, and the sampling period is extended up to one month during the cooler 
months.
	At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are brought back to 
the laboratory for cleaning, calibration, and servicing, by methods outlined in 
the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  Downtime for doing these procedures 
normally ranges from 24 to 48 hours.  After cleaning the data loggers, the 
dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and is allowed to stretch for 24 
hours before calibration begins.  The pH, conductivity, depth, and turbidity 
sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 and 10, conductivity 
standard of 58.64mS/cm depth in the air, and turbidity standards of 0 and 200 
NTU, respectively.  The water level sensor is zeroed in air, and the chlorophyll 
is zeroed in distilled water.  The DO sensor is calibrated in air-saturated 
water.  In addition to the procedures outlined in the manual, we conduct a DO 
membrane integrity test prior to deployment to determine if the membrane was 
damaged during calibration.
	Several quality assurance checks are used to determine if the sensor 
readings drifted significantly during deployment. In-situ measurements of 
dissolved oxygen, expressed in mg/L, salinity, pH, and water temperature are 
taken during deployment and retrieval of the data sondes.  Water samples are 
collected at the same depth as the sensors.  Water temperature, salinity, and pH 
are measured directly with a thermistor, refractometer and pH meter, 
respectively, and dissolved oxygen level is determined by the Winkler titration.  
Post-deployment measurements of all the parameters are taken before cleaning the 
data loggers.  Sensors are immersed in the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., 
pH) and readings are recorded. A DO membrane integrity test also is conducted to 
determine if the membrane was damaged during deployment.  The results of these 
checks are used to evaluate the validity of the data (see Post Deployment 
Information section). 

5. Site Locations and Character:
ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve is one of the largest undeveloped 
estuaries on the East Coast. The study area encompasses the Ashepoo, Combahee 
and South Edisto River basins, which empty into St. Helena Sound.  The NERR 
consists of approximately 135,000 acres of diverse estuarine wetlands providing 
preserved habitats for fish and wildlife.
		The two sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South 
Edisto River. Both had an average year round tidal range of 2.0 m (6.5 feet), 
with a maximum of 2.45 m (8.1 feet) and a minimum of 1.51 m (5.0 feet). The 
descriptions of the sites are as follows: 
Station A (BB) - this site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32° 29 38.72125 N and 80° 19 21.69864 W). Surrounded by residential 
and commercial development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this 
station is designated as the "treatment" site. Pollution sources include houses 
bordering the creek, many of them with little setbacks from the bordering 
Spartina marsh; forty docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and 
Wolmanized pilings; boat dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a 
paved road and three boat ramps off the creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA 
treated bulkheads and fueling areas located about 0.5 miles downstream; two 
commercial seafood docks with 8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three 
restaurants. The creek is closed to shellfish harvesting because of the human 
development in the vicinity. Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh 
dominated by Spartina alterniflora with isolated areas of Salicornia. Upland 
fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oak and cedars. Reefs of American 
oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fringe the creek banks. At the time of 
reconnaissance, depth of the creek midway through ebb tide was 5 feet and 
salinity was 23 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station B (SP) - this site is in a tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32° 31 40.59518 N and 80° 21 41.2548 W). It is surrounded by a wide 
expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh. Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs 
fringe the banks.  Maritime forest communities comprised of species such as wax 
myrtles, live oaks, and palmettos dominate the upland areas.  Development in the 
immediate area is sparse. This creek is subject to relatively light boat 
traffic. At the time of reconnaissance, depth at low tide was 2.5 feet and 
salinity was 21 ppt. 
	The following discussions of trends in water quality at the monitoring 
stations are based on data collected from March 1995 through December 1997.  
During this period, water temperature at both monitoring sites exhibited a 
seasonal pattern with lowest values occurring in December-January.  The lowest 
monthly water temperature observed was 8.9°C, which occurred in February 
1996 at St. Pierre Creek; whereas maximum temperatures occurred in July and 
August with the highest monthly water temperature 38.9°C occurring in July 1995 
at Big Bay Creek.  Diurnal variation in temperature was evident with warmest 
temperatures occurring from 1300 hr to 1800 hr at both sites.  Salinity also 
exhibited seasonal variability during the same period, with lowest values 
occurring in March at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks.  Another period of low 
average monthly salinity occurred at Big Bay Creek in December 1997.  Average 
annual salinity for both sites was in the polyhaline regime, with a mean of 29.4 
‰ at Big Bay Creek and 26.3‰ at St. Pierre Creek; however, for all years, 
salinity ranged from 0.3-41.7 ‰ at Big Bay and from 0-41.7‰ at St. Pierre 
Creek.  Local precipitation and evaporation conditions are most likely the major 
contributors to monthly variability in salinity.  Analysis of the data indicates 
that tidal stage strongly influences salinity.  As expected, highest values of 
salinity occurred on the flood tide. 
	It appears that tidal stage also influences pH. Spectral analysis revealed 
a periodicity for pH and water depth with a sinusoidal period at ~ 12 hrs., 
representing tidal periodicity.  Time series plots of pH indicated variability 
of ~1 standard unit (su) on a daily basis. The pH at both sites was 
very similar, ranging from 5.3-8.4; however, the preponderance of measurements 
were >7 at both sites.  The pH observed at the two monitoring sites appears to 
be attributable to natural conditions. Marked variations in pH can also occur 
diurnally due to changes in primary production and respiration.
	Dissolved oxygen concentrations appeared to track depth for part of the 
cycle, with lowest values occurring on low tides.  Afternoon and evening values 
were not as low as early morning values, suggesting a diurnal component.  
Dissolved oxygen values at the two monitoring sites were generally high 
throughout the year with averages of 83.6% saturation and 6.6 mg/l for Big Bay 
Creek and 78.5% saturation and 6.3 mg/l for St. Pierre Creek, with highest 
values in winter and lowest in summer.  Hypoxic events (<28% air saturation) 
were observed in every season, but summer was clearly the season with the 
greatest percent of time when DO was 28%. Whereas, supersaturation (>100% air 
saturation) occurred primarily in the winter, with values exceeding 120% at both 
creeks. There are a few differences among the sites such as, hypoxic conditions 
occur more frequently at St. Pierre Creek.
	Unlike the other parameters monitored at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks, 
there appears to be no distinct seasonal trend in turbidity; however, monthly 
variability appeared greater at the St. Pierre site. This may be due to 
fluctuations in the amount of detritus being washed from the extensive salt 
marsh and upland sites that surround St. Pierre Creek.
	It appears that metal leachates from the pilings, even the new ones, in 
reasonably tidal flushed areas, along Big Bay Creek have negligible ecological 
effects, according to the 1994 study by Weis and Weis.  Their findings indicated 
that concentrations of the metals (Cr, Cu, and As) in sediments adjacent to 
pilings along Big Bay Creek were generally not significantly elevated, and there 
were no consistent differences in the benthic communities between the Big Bay 
and St. Pierre monitoring sites.
	However, the highest values of PAHs encountered (299.0 ng/g) during a 
study by Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews from 1993-1995 were in the South 
Edisto watershed at Big Bay Creek; this station also had detectable levels of 
PCBs, concentrations as well.  The concentrations in St. Pierre Creek were below 
the level of detection for persistent pesticides and for PCBs.  At most 34 
sites, contaminant levels were below the level of detection for persistent 
pesticides and for PCBs, suggesting that the ACE is a relatively pristine 
system.

8. 	Associated researchers and projects:
		Dr. Clark Alexander of Skidaway Institute continued the 
investigations of the sedimentation process in the ACE Basin. Concurrent studies 
were conducted in the several locations in the Ashepoo and South Edisto Rivers 
during May 1999.  Continuous flow velocity readings were measured over a 13-hour 
period at an anchored station while discrete measurements of various water 
parameters (i.e., salinity, turbidity) were taken at various locations in 
the same water body. Deep sediment cores were also collected at the anchor 
stations.
		Dr. Amy Ringwood of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute 
received CICEET funding to conduct this study in ACE Basin and North 
Inlet/Winyah Bay Reserves.  Funds for this project were awarded in October 1998.  
Eight sites were selected in the ACE Basin, including the two water quality 
monitoring stations.  Oysters (Crassostrea virginica), grass shrimp 
(Paleomonetes pugio), and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) were collected from 
these sites during the February-April time frame in 1999 and 2000.  
Hepatopancreatic/liver tissues were dissected and used for three different 
cellular biomarker assays (lysosomal destabilization, glutathione oncentrations, 
and lipid peroxidation).  Dr. Ringwood is currently completing analysis of the 
samples collected and writing the final report for submission.
	Drs. James T. Morris, Madilyn Fletcher, John Jensen, Alan Lewitus, Peter 
A. Noble, and Dwayne Porter of University of South Carolina received CISNet 
funding to conduct this three-year study in the North Inlet/Winyah Bay Reserve; 
and, prior to the first sampling season (summer 1999), the investigators added 
the ACE Basin NERR to the study.  The researchers will compare nutrient loading, 
nutrient dynamics, and productivity in the North Inlet to that of the S. Edisto 
River (ACE Basin NERR).
	Dr. Charles Wenner of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute received 
funding through the National Marine Fisheries Service in January of 2001 to 
continue an ongoing survey of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in the South Edisto 
and Combahee River basins, by electro-fishing in tidal freshwater and low 
salinity brackish water.  Although red drum are the target species, all 
catches are separated, measured and weighted to provide a distribution and 
population size for each species.    	
	The ACE Basin NERR received initial funding from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency to establish a National Atmospheric Deposition Program site in 
the Reserve. Sampling efforts began on January 1, 2002. Weekly precipitation 
samples are collected and analyzed for atmospheric pollutants.  The recipitation 
collector is located on Bear Island, a Wildlife Management Area inside the NERR.

December 1-31, 2001 Sampling Period
Big Bay
a) During the following periods of the November 7 -December 3 deployment, the pH 
readings were deleted. The sensor did not read within the required range during 
the post-deployment calibration check on pH 7 and pH 10.

12. Missing Data
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing 
due to equipment failure, probes not installed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks
Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Blanket Statements:
a) DO less than 28% air saturation (hypoxia) is frequently observed in the ACE 
Basin NERR during the warmer months, especially June-August, however hypoxia was 
also observed in November in St. Pierre Creek.  Hypoxia events are common in the 
salt march environment and occurred consistently during late ebb, low slack, and 
early flood tides.  Natural factors can contribute to these low DO measurements 
including insufficient water circulation, elevated water temperature, and the 
lack of stratification in shallow estuarine habitats.  
b) DO greater than 120% air saturation (supersaturation) is frequently observed 
in the ACE Basin NERR during the colder months, especially January to March, 
however was also observed in August in St. Pierre Creek.  Supersaturation events 
are not uncommon in shallow estuarine waters and usually occur during late 
daylight hours as water temperature rises, thus elevating primary productivity.  
The supersaturation event in August corresponded with the highest water levels, 
suggesting an environmental cause.
c) DO measurements between 100% and 120% air saturation are not listed in the 
metadata.  These DO readings consistently occur in the ACE Basin NERR and are 
not considered to be suspect.

Depth (meters) Blanket Statement: Depth readings are suspect throughout several 
deployments in both Big Bay and St. Pierre Creeks for 2001.  Reasons vary from 
the data sonde not positioned at the bottom of the deployment mount, human 
tampering of the data sonde during the deployment, or for reasons unknown at 
this time.  The differences in depth readings between the suspect deployment and 
the prior/post deployments range from 0.5 to 2.0 meters. However, all post 
calibration measurements were with in expected range, so the data 
were not deleted. 
  
Turbidity (NTU) Blanket Statement:  In January of 2002, Mike Lizotte, a 
representative for YSI, bought to the attention of CDMO and NERR staff, that 
turbidity standards used in calibration not purchased directly from YSI may be 
producing inaccurate data.  The Advanced Polymer Systems Incorporated (APS) 
turbidity standard used by the ACE Basin NERR for calibration during 2001 
deployments could create as much as a 20 percent total variance in the 
turbidity reading. According to Mike Lizotte, the standard angle between the 
fibers, the backscatter, may account for a variance in the turbidity reading.  
In February of 2002, we will compare the APS turbidity standard used by the 
Reserve against the approved turbidity standards for YSI.  A newly calibrated 
YSI turbidity probe will be placed in each standard, the values recorded, and 
the variances between standards will be calculated.
