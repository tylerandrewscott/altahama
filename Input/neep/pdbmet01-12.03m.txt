2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  From 
January 1, 2003 through November 26,2003 the CDMO Data Logger Program 
(PADBA_01.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controlled the sensors and data 
collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection 
schedule).  The data were downloaded once a month in the field to a Toshiba laptop 
computer connected to the storage module using PC208W software or a Palm m515 
using PConnect software, both are Campbell Scientific software. Once an entire month of 
data were available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) was used 
to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic 
to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP automatically inputs and converts 
the monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  There are three main steps the 
WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an 
Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error 
criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and summary reports. All 
anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in the "Anomalous Data/Suspect 
Data" section, along with any corrections that were preformed.  The raw data and Access 
tables are stored on the laptop, on the desktop SWMP computer in the lab and archived 
on compact discs. 

After November 26, 2003 at 12:00 the new CDMO data logger program 
(NERR_4.CSI) was loaded into the CR10X and a larger storage module (SM4M) was 
installed. Data are downloaded to a Toshiba laptop computer using PC208W. The files are 
exported in a comma-delimited format (.DAT) and opened in Microsoft Excel for pre-
processing with the EQWin format macro (EQWinFormat.xls) that was developed by the 
CDMO to reformat the header columns, insert station codes, insert a date column 
(mm/dd/yyyy), correct the time column format and reformat the data to the appropriate 
number of decimal places. The pre-processed file is then ready to be copied into the 
EQWin weather.eqi file where the data are QA/QC checked and archived in a database. 
EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data set outliers (values which 
fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure) and large changes in the 
data. The raw data, Excel files and EQWin database are stored on the laptop, on the 
desktop SWMP computer in the lab and archived on an external hard drive and compact 
discs. 

EQwin now replaces the WDMP as the NERR MET primary QA/QC program. 

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

Any anomalous data are investigated and noted in the Anomalous Data/Suspect Data 
section. Any missing data are noted in the Missing Data section. The most common 
errors/anomalies noted in 2003 are: 

1. Air temp difference (over a 15 minute time period) is greater than 3.0 degrees C 
2. Relative humidity difference (over a 15 minute time period) is greater than 25%
3. Wind speed is less than 0.5 m/s 

All errors were double checked with other data that could support such "anomalous" 
weather changes and noted in Section 11.

b) Data Collection Schedule

i) Data are collected in the following formats:

1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. (Arrays 
150 and 151). (EQWin array 15).
2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that are 
hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106). (EQWin 
array 60).
3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246). (EQWin array 144).

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record meteorological data at Padilla Bay for use in studies 
investigating correlations between meteorological data and water quality data, biological 
data, or other phenomenon in Padilla Bay and its watershed.


4) Research methods:

From January through November 26,2003 data were downloaded once a month from the 
weather station because the storage module could only hold 49 days of data before the 
datalogger began to overwrite data and the Weather Data Management Program could not 
organize and sort raw data files that span more than two months. In November a new 
program was uploaded to the CR10X that is formatted to be used with EQWin, which is a 
database application that is replacing the Weather Data Management Program. 
The sensors are visually inspected at this time for debris or damage except for the PAR 
sensor that cannot be seen from the ground so is inspected less often. Due to the location of 
the weather station in the middle of flat farm fields the sensors require very little cleaning. 
The most common problem occurs seasonally from air borne seeds partially blocking the rain 
gauge funnel. To mitigate this problem weeds near the site are cut before they set seed. 
Sensors are sent in to Campbell Scientific to be calibrated according to their maintenance 
schedule recommendations. On occasion very high or very low barometric pressures were 
checked against weather data collected in Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island.


5) Site location and character:

Padilla Bay (48º 30' N; 122º 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern Puget Sound 
located in the greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary. It is an "orphaned" estuary in that 
the Skagit River, which formed the delta mud flats of Padilla Bay, no longer enters the bay 
directly. The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera marina, which covers 
approximately 3,000 ha. Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, now covers about 
350 ha of the bay. Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with a mean range of 1.55m. Salinity varies 
from about 15 to 30 PSU. Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed is 
agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay. Some freshwater from 
the Skagit now enters Padilla Bay from the south through the Swinomish Channel which 
connects Padilla Bay to Skagit Bay. Other major freshwater flows into this area of the Puget 
Sound-Georgia Basin estuary from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north. 
Padilla Bay is bordered on the east and south by flat, diked farmland; farther to the east are 
foothills of the Cascade Range. March Point, on the western edge of the reserve, is the site of 
two large oil refineries. To the north and west are the San Juan Islands of northern Puget 
Sound. 

The weather station is located near the southeast corner (122° 28' 4.81" W; 48° 27' 50.58" N) 
of Padilla Bay on a 40 hectare demonstration farm that is owned by the Reserve. Flat fields 
that are farmed for seasonal crops surround the site. Access is off of Bayview-Edison road 
about 150 m down a gravel driveway.

The sensors are mounted on a 3 m tower that is secured to a concrete pad as specified by the 
manufacturer, Campbell Scientific. The relative humidity/temperature sensor is mounted 2 m 
high and the wind and PAR sensors are at the top of the tower 3 m above ground level. The 
tipping-bucket rain gauge is bolted to a slab of wood that is attached to the top of a 55 gallon 
metal drum filled with water for stability, the top of the rain gauge is1.2 m above ground 
level. Surrounding the site is a six foot high chain link fence for security. The weather station 
is about 300 m from the diked edge of the bay and approximately 4 km SE of the Bayview 
Channel YSI deployment site and about 4 km south of the Padilla Bay Research Reserve 
laboratory.

101	12	316	1300	Missing 101 Array (Hourly data)
102	12	316	1300	Missing 102 Array (Hourly data)

243	12	316	2400	Missing 243 Array (Daily data)
244	12	316	2400	Missing 244 Array (Daily data)	

On 11/5 at about 13:45 and on 11/20 at about 12:15 the technician attempted to upload a new 
program to the CR10X, because this erases the 5 second data for that day the one hour and 24 
hour average data for those periods were deleted. 
On November 26 a new program was uploaded to the CR10X so the hourly data (60) for 
12:00 and the daily data (144) were deleted.


13) Missing data:

November 2003

During the following period data are missing because the power was turned off for more than 
15 minutes:
Array   Day     Julian	Time	Error message 
150	12	316	1230	Missing 150 Array (15 minute data)


14) Other Remarks/notes

During the first week of November there were very low temperatures associated with a cold
weather event with the low temperatures in the negative temperature range. 

Occasionally throughout the year, prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program 
on 11/26/2003, wind direction values were recorded as small negative numbers (<-0.99). 
According to Campbell Scientific newer programs correct this to zero so these values have 
been changed to zero.

PAR values:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 11/26/2003, all values less than 
0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. Those values may have indicated an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems or a sensor malfunction. Because they were changed in the 
raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity values:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 11/26/2003, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%. Those values may have indicated super 
saturated air, calibration problems or a sensor malfunction. Because they were changed in the 
raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
