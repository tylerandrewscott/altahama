2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  
The CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls 
the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then interfaced with the 
PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  This software was located on a 
laptop computer to which the data was downloaded manually in the field.  Data 
was downloaded monthly from a storage module located within the weather station.    
Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This 
program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data 
collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly 
raw data file into and Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP 
performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an 
Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of 
error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error and 
summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in 
Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in 
the Data Correction section below.  

Gemteck's EQwin version 5 and the CDMO developed Microsoft Excel EQWinFormat.xls macro now replaces 
the WDMP as the NERR MET database management program and primary QA/QC program.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

For data collection, the CR10X datalogger was programmed to collect data in the 
following formats:
i)	15-minute data are collected instantaneously for Air Temperature (C), 
Relative Humidity (%), Barometric Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and 
Wind Direction (degrees).  15-minute Precipitation (mm) and PAR 
(mmol/m^2) data are totaled from 5-second readings, prior to NERR_4.CSI

ii)	15-minute average, maximum and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb) and Wind Speed (m/s) with NERR_4.CSI.

iii)	Hourly average, maximum, and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Hourly 
totals for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute 
readings.

iv)	Daily average, maximum and minumum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Daily totals 
for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute readings.

Data were stored on a Campbell Scientific storage module (SM192 or SM4M), which 
was retrieved monthly.  The data were downloaded and pre-processed as described in 
Section 2.  QA/QC of the data was conducted using either the WDMP or EQWin.  
WDMP error reports and EQWin queries were based on the following anomalous data 
criteria:

Air Temp:
- 15 min sample not greater than max for the day
- 15 min sample not less than the min for the day
- 15 min sample not greater than 3.0 C from the previous 15 minutes (WDMP only)
- Max and min temp recorded for the day (WDMP only)
- 1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the 
hour (WDMP only)
-Sample not greater than 50 C or less than –30 C (EQWin only)

-Max and min humidity recorded for the day (WDMP only)
-1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the   
hour (WDMP only)
-Sample not greater than 100% or less than 0% (EQWin only)

Pressure:
- Pressure not greater than 1040 mb or less than 980 mb (WDMP only)
- Pressure changes greater than 5 mb per hour (WDMP only)
- Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day (WDMP only)
-1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the 
hour (WDMP only)

-Wind speed not less than 0.5 m/s for 12 consecutive hours (EQWin only)

Wind Direction:
- Wind direction not greater than 360 degrees or less than 0 degrees

Rainfall:

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data within the 
York River watershed in order to observe any environmental changes or trends 
over time.  Samples were taken every 5 seconds and 15 minutes over roughly one-
week collecting intervals.  


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce both 
hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An 
instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 
150.   A one-month sampling interval was chosen so that the storage 
module would not run out of room and overwrite data.  Periodically, sensors on 
the weather station are inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is 
repaired and/or cleaned.  Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell 
Scientific for calibration at minimum of every two years.  


5) Site location and character:

Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a long-term water quality-
monitoring program, and stream gauge station at Taskinas creek station.  The 
Taskinas Creek station is located in the transitional zone of the York River 
tributary in the York River State Park.

The Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Virginia is located on 
the York River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay.  The weather station is 
located at York River State Park that borders the York River and includes the 
Taskinas Creek tributary.  The bordering river is 50 km long, 38 kilometers from 
the mouth of the river, and it 2.25 kilometer wide near the weather station, 
and.  The weather station in located (37°24' 50.79850" N, 76°42' 44.51934" 
W) on a bluff (11m elevation) 60m from the York River in a manicured lawn area 
of the park.  No trees or other major structures within a 35m radius of weather 
station.  The stream gauge located 2km NW (288 degree of weather station and the 
water quality station located 200m  (298 degree) of weather station.  The 
weather station has a landscape fence around it to keep visitors of the park 
away from the weather station.  All the instruments, the Wind Sentry, 
Temperature and Humidity sensor, Barometric Sensor, and LiCor Sensor all located 
on the approximately 3.5 m aluminum tower following the descriptions outlined in 
the CDMO Manual V 4.0.  The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge is located within 2m of 
the tower.  The sensors were wired to the CR10X following the protocol in the 
CDMO Manual.  


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected at the Taskinas Creek since 1996.  The current 
weather station has been operational since 1996. Data was collected for the 
entire year in 2003.
