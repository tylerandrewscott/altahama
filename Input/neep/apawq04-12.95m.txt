2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6000 into the PC6000 software, plotted, and 
initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing data.  Hydrolab data are downloaded from the 
Hydrolab Datasonde 3 to PCPLUS software.  Both YSI and Hydrolab raw data files are then 
downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) and imported into Microsoft Excel as a comma-space 
delimited file (.csv).  These raw data files are then organized into standardized monthly data sets 
using the import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, import the 
raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters for depth readings if necessary, 
and save the monthly files as either a .csv or .xls file.  Once in monthly format, these files are 
then run through the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which identify outliers, insure correct number of 
data points for each Date/Hour count, and format the columns in the correct order and size.  The 
monthly files are then carefully edited by staff for data anomalies which are identified in Section 
11 (Data Anomalies) of this document.  Any data that are deleted by staff are replaced with 
periods and identified in Section 12 (Missing Data) of this document.   Monthly edited files are 
then sent as .xls files, along with an updated metadata form, to CDMO.

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the Tates Hell 
Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the late 1960's and early 1970's by 
timber companies.  It shortened the drainage period and allowed increased runoff with a 
concommittant increase in pH which had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East 
Bay.  Because of this some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was 
done.  A large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the Northwest 
Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant will allow them to begin restoration of the 
site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning the dataloggers at the surface and 
bottom in East Bay will allow the Reserve to monitor changes in water quality during this 
restoration effort. 

4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the NERRS national 
monitoring effort.  Prior to this, ANERR has been and continues to monitor three stations in the 
Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's.  East Bay 
(bottom) is one of these stations and is used in this monitoring program in addition to the YSI 
datalogger placed near the surface at this site. Since a Hydrolab datalogger was initially installed 
at the bottom at the East Bay station, we continued to use the Hydrolab brand in order to keep 
the data consistent with the previous two years of data.

Prior to deployment, both the YSI 6000 and the Datasonde 3 are calibrated for conductivity, 
dissolved oxygen, depth, and pH following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating and 
Service Manual (with addendum 7/94) and the Hydrolab Operating Manual, respectively.  Lab 
grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) are initially used to calibrate the YSI's, which are 
then used to check working standards made up and used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab 
grade standards are also used periodically to check the accuracy of the working salinity standards. 
 The only variation from the manual is the use of only one pH standard for one-point calibration 
of pH rather than three-point calibration.  The membranes for the dissolved oxygen probe are 
installed at least 12 hours prior to calibration.  Depth is set to 0.0 meters in the lab. 

Both YSI and Hydrolab dataloggers are attached to the same piling by divers.  The YSI is oriented 
with the probes upward in order to measure as close to the surface as possible.  The dataloggers 
are first attached to a stainless steel (SS) bar using  2 SS hose clamps, which is then attached to 
the piling using two additional SS hose clamps.  A SS cable with cable clamp is then inserted 
through one of the eye-hooks on the datalogger and around the piling as a safety cable.  The top 
of the SS bar is bent at 90 degrees to provide protection for the datalogger from boats, propellers, 
fishing line, or oyster tongs.  Every two weeks the dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, 
and inspected.  Freshly calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no 
data gaps.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the northwestern part of 
Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and 
encompasses most of the Apalachicola Bay system, including 20 miles of the lower Apalachicola 
River.  Passes, both natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a causeway and is 
located to the north of the bay proper.  The sampling site is located in the upper reaches of East 
Bay and is influenced by local runoff from Tates Hell, the East bay marshes, and distributary 
flow, some of which comes from the Apalachicola River via the East River.  The piling location is 
latitude 29É47.15' N and longitude 84É52.52' W.  Normal tidal range is approximately 0.5 meters. 
 Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt but is generally in the low range due to the freshwater input 
from the Tateπs Hell drainage.  The freshwater input is very tanic and usually dark colored.  
Flows vary with local rainfall and are not quantified due to the diverse sources of the runoff.  
Depth at mean high water is 2.2 meters.  The bottom type is soft sediment, primarily silt and 
clay, with no vegetation present.



6. Data collection period:
East Bay surface sampling with the YSI began on April 17, 1995.  East Bay bottom sampling 
began on May 1, 1995.  Both continue through December 31 of this year.  

7. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been using Hydrolab Datasonde 3πs to monitor water quality at three stations in 
Apalachicola Bay since May of 1992.  One of these stations was moved from the mid-bay area 
near the Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site in January of 1993.  The other two 
are located on two of the largest commercially important oyster bars in the bay.  These stations, 
like East Bay, are intended to be long-term.
