2. Entry verification.
	These data were directly downloaded from the YSI 6600 Extended Deployment 
System (EDS) data-sonde to the PC6000 software on a Dell Optiplex GX100 and a 
Dell Optiplex GX300.  The data were graphed and printed using the PC6000 
software and then exported to Microsoft Excel.  Charting and plotting routines 
within PC6000 and Excel were used to verify the accuracy of the data.  In 
addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros provided by the CDMO were used to format and 
check the dataset for outliers beyond what the probes measure.  Outliers and 
erroneous data were checked manually using the protocol defined in Appendix B of 
CDMO Operations Manual (v. 4.0). Finally, an additional screening protocol, 
designed by Mike Shirley was used to identify potential outliers based on the 
standard deviation of the screened dataset. This protocol uses a Microsoft Excel 
template to flag "unusual" values to be examined more closely.  Values greater 
than or less than 3 standard deviation are flagged as potential outliers. Change 
in values from sequential readings are flagged if the value is greater than ½ 
standard deviation. These outliers are eliminated only when the post-
calibration results or the values of manually recorded "spot" checks of the 
water quality measurements during data-logger retrieval indicate equipment 
malfunction or the combination of readings suggest the instrument was exposed 
during low tide.  The water quality specialist performs all data verification 
and screening.


3. Research objectives.
       Beginning January 1, 2001, two stations, Lower Henderson Creek and Middle 
Blackwater River were designated as the Reserve's permanent SWMP (System-wide 
monitoring program) sites.  With the exception of turbidity, the dataset at 
these stations is nearly continuous beginning in April of 1996.  The dataset 
from these monitoring stations represents the longest record of continuous water 
quality measurements of all the Rookery Bay NERR water quality stations.  In 
January 2002 two additional sites, Faka Union Bay and Fakahatchee Bay, were 
designated as SWMP water quality stations.  All stations log temperature, 
turbidity, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and depth at 30-minute intervals  
       These four stations are in estuaries with watersheds having different 
patterns of landuse.  Their placement addresses priority resource management 
issues that are identified in the Reserve's management plan.  Specifically, the 
data from these stations are providing valuable information concerning the 
affects of landuse activities on the quantity, quality and timing of freshwater 
inflow into the Reserve.  
       The Lower Henderson Creek station receives most of its freshwater from a 
canal system that drains a watershed area with approximately 50% developed 
versus natural landscape.  Landuse in the developed area is divided equally 
between residential and agricultural activities.  A weir controls most of the 
freshwater flowing into Henderson Creek.  The Reserve obtained grant funding to 
upgrade the existing weir structure in May 2002 to allow for an automated 
control of water release.  The dataset being obtained from the Lower Henderson
Creek station, along with biological monitoring, is being used to develop a 
water release strategy for Henderson Creek.
       Relative to Henderson Creek, the Middle Blackwater River station receives 
a more natural pattern of freshwater inflow and has a watershed that has 75% 
natural landscape.  Agriculture dominates the land-use activities within the 
developed area of Blackwater River watershed.  Based on modeling of historic 
flow-way patterns, the watershed draining into Blackwater River has been 
significantly reduced resulting in higher than normal salinity values.
        Faka Union Bay represents the most extreme condition of altered 
freshwater inflows of the four Rookery Bay NERR monitoring sites.  Forty –eight 
miles of canals drain 94 square miles of watershed intercepting freshwater which 
historically distributed to four Bays.
       Fakahatchee Bay is a relatively undisturbed system. The Fakahatchee Bay 
watershed is primarily under Preserve status and has been relatively undisturbed 
from the hydrological alteration of the SGGE (Southern Golden Gate Estates) 
canal system.  The water quality data collected from this station serves as a 
reference for assessing the effectiveness of watershed habitat restoration 
projects in southwest Florida.
       

4. Research methods.
	In January 2003 all data-loggers were upgraded from the 6600 model to the 
Extended Deployment System (EDS).  Prior to deployment, the sondes are 
calibrated for pH, specific conductivity, and turbidity and dissolved oxygen 
following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  A 
two-point calibration is used for pH (Fisher buffers 7& 10) and turbidity (0 & 
123 NTU YSI, Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution (YSI conductivity calibrator) is used 
to calibrate specific conductivity.  Dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % 
saturation.  Sondes are deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 
weeks time the fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling period is set 
for 30-minute intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the half-hour).  
The following physical water quality parameters are recorded: temperature, 
specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (mg/l), dissolved oxygen (% 
saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A post-deployment calibration is done 
after the sonde is taken out of the water using the same calibration protocol.  
 NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and the original data files are 
reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST).
       Both sondes are housed within 4-inch diameter, PVC pipes, which are 
attached to "aid-to-navigation" pilings.  The pipes are oriented vertically and 
are attached tightly with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom portion of 
the pipe is open and sits 6 inches above the bottom.  Probe readings are 
measured approximately 6-8 inches above the substrate.  Thirty 2-inch diameter 
holes are drilled circumferentially around the lower half of the pipe to ensure 
adequate water flow around the probes.  Sondes are hung by plastic coated steel 
cable inside the pipes; the cable is bolted to the piling.  A 'kryptonite' 
bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde inside the housing.
	The sondes are further protected from fouling by restricting the openings 
within the sonde guard with plastic screening. The plastic mesh (with 1/8 in 
diamond-shaped holes) was attached on the outside of the sonde guards' 
circumference. Furthermore, the PVC is serviced on a minimum of a monthly basis, 
and replaced bi-annually.
       

5. Site location & character.
Site #1- Lower HendersonCreek (LH):
	The "Lower Henderson" site, site #1, is located at the mouth of Henderson 
Creek.  The piling (manatee caution sign) is located right of center (while 
facing downstream) of the creek channel, approximately 100 meters from RKBNERR's 
boat dock. The Lower HendersonCreek labeling is to clarify the site from other 
historical water quality stations.
       Tides at Lower HendersonCreek are mixed and range from 0 m to 2.76 m 
(average 1.06 m).  The monitoring site is located in Lower HendersonCreek, 
approximately 5 km downstream of a four-lane highway (SR 951) that crosses the 
creek.  The creek is 5.8 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an average 
mid-channel depth of approximately 2 m MHW, and an average width of 239 m.  At 
the sampling site, the depth is 2 m MHW and the width is 600 m.  Salinities at 
this site range from 0 to 38.4 ppt. Creek bottom habitats are predominantly fine 
sand and there is no bottom vegetation.  The dominant marsh vegetation near the 
sampling site is red mangrove.  The dominant natural vegetation of the watershed 
is hydric pine and cypress.  Upland land use near the sampling site includes 
residential areas with septic systems.  	
       Watershed activities that potentially impact the site include non-point 
source pollution from road runoff, drift of mosquito control pesticides, runoff 
from upstream agricultural areas and leachate from nearby residential septic 
systems. The amount of water released from this weir can sometimes mask natural 
tidal salinity patterns.  The historic Henderson Creek watershed is 
approximately 50% under public ownership and much of this protected area has 
intact cypress sloughs and other wetland vegetation.  Canals and water use for 
agriculture and human consumption have altered the hydroperiod of this 
watershed. Consequently, the Henderson watershed receives non-point source 
pollutant runoff from a variety of sources.

Site #2- Middle Blackwater River (MB):
	The " Middle Blackwater River" sonde, site #2, is located at the mouth of 
the river.  The sonde is affixed to navigational marker #17 within the river 
channel.  The average depth at this marker is approximately 2 meters at MHW.  
The Middle Blackwater River labeling is to clarify the site from other 
historical water quality stations.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with oyster 
shell matter mixed in.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of the 
river.  Upstream influences consist of Collier-Semonile State Parks boat basin 
and upstream agricultural fields, adjacent to Blackwater River's main feeder 
canal, SR 41 canal.  In addition, canals and roads built during the 1950's have 
caused significant disruptions to overland sheetflow reducing the amounts of 
freshwater flowing to this estuary.  Despite these alterations, the salinity 
fluctuations of this site suggest that seasonal fluctuations in salinity are 
more closely correlated to watershed rainfall patterns than salinities of 
estuaries with water control structures, such as Henderson Creek    Blackwater 
salinities range from 0-40 ppt and fluctuate with the tides and watershed 
rainfall.  The tide range for Middle Blackwater River varies between 0.2 and 1.8 
meters.

Site #3- Faka Union Bay (FU):
The " Faka Union Bay" sonde, site #3, is located at the mouth of the Faka Union 
Canal.  The sonde is affixed to a manatee speed zone sign within the main 
channel. The average depth at this site is approximately 2 meters at MHW.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with oyster 
shell matter mixed in.  Mature red mangrove forests and spoil islands dominate 
the banks of canal.  Upstream influences consist Port of the Islands development 
and marina. The upstream water flow consists of an elaborate canal system.  The 
system is explained as follows:
	Structure					Type
Faka Union Canal Weir #1			     Fixed Crest
Faka Union Canal Weir #2		  Fixed Crest Raised with Gates
Faka Union Canal Weir #3		    Fixed Crest with V-Notch

Merritt Canal Weir #1			 Adjustable Concrete Blocks
Merritt Canal Weir #2			   Fixed Crest with V-Notch 
Prairie Canal Weir #1			      Adjustable Steel Plates

  The system has altered natural water drainage patterns into Faka Union Bay.  
Salinities range from 0 to 39.5 ppt and fluctuate daily based on water 
management of the water control structures.  The tide range for Faka Union Bay 
varies between 0.2 and 1.6meters.

Site #4- Fakahatchee Bay (FB):
The " Fakahatchee Bay" sonde, site #4, is located at the mouth of two rivers, 
Fakahatchee and East River.  The sonde is placed in PVC  housing secured to PVC 
pipe approximately 6 inches off the bottom.  The sonde is located within the bay 
adjacent to one of the Reserve's biomonitoring stations. The average depth at 
MHW is approximately 2 meters.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand, silt and oyster 
shell matter.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of the rivers.  
Upstream influences consist of minimal effects of disturbed freshwater inflow 
from the Prairie Canal, a part of the SGGE canal system, to the Fakahatchee.  
Minimal non-point source pollutants are possible from the culverts under I-75 
and US 41.  Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve and Big Cypress National Park 
manage the headwaters of Fakahatchee Bay.  Salinities range from 10-42 ppt and 
fluctuate daily with the tides and seasonal rainfall.  The tide range for 
Fakahatchee varies between 0.2 and 1.8 meters.

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration probes (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
Anomalous Data Section (10).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting data.

of September.

a.) General weather patterns affecting the water quality sites:

January: January is one of the dry months in Southwest Florida.  In spite of the 
intrusion of several cold fronts, rainfall events in January were few and far 
between. The average rainfall in the Basin was 31% below the long-term average.
February :  The seasonal cold and dry conditions which prevailed in January 
continued through the first two weeks of February, however, a series of cold 
fronts generated favorable conditions for widespread showers and thunderstorms 
during the third and fourth week of the month.
March:  Although the regular intrusion of cold fronts were less frequent in 
March, an unusually warm humid condition yielded a fertile environment for 
showers and thunderstorms. This system generated up to 3 inches of rain during 
the third and fourth weeks.
April: The intrusion of a series of cold fronts with prevailing low-pressure 
systems in the Gulf of Mexico yielded a fertile environment for showers and 
thunderstorms in April. These systems generated up to 7 inches of rain in many 
areas of the Basin during the third and fourth weeks of the month. 
May:  An early start to wet season generated wetter than normal hydrological 
conditions throughout South Florida. Early summer-like breeze and convection 
heating patterns, along with a low atmospheric pressure in the eastern Gulf of 
Mexico, produced multiple days of moderate to heavy rainfall over the last 10 
days of May. Inland areas received substantial amounts more than coastal areas.
June:  Summertime thunderstorm activities generated wetter than normal 
conditions in South Florida. 
July: Wet season conditions continued though out July, with rainfall across the 
basin sporadic. The movement of summer sea breeze and convection heating 
continued to produce regular thunderstorms with inland areas receiving less rain 
than coastal areas.
August:  Wet season hydrological conditions continued throughout August due to 
continued convection heating and tropical moisture patterns. No direct 
influences of tropical weather activity occurred. 
September:  Considerably wetter than normal hydrological conditions prevailed in 
September. Early in the month, Tropical storm Henri produced approximately 4 
inches of rain. And on September 29th a stalled frontal boundary generated up to 
10.5 inches of rainfall within a 24 hr period.
October: The wet season came to an abrupt end in October. The end of the daily 
sea breezes and lack of cold fronts resulted in little rainfall activity.
November:  The dry season had a wetter than normal start with a complex weather 
pattern of moisture developing in the Gulf of Mexico to form a cold front during 
the first week of November.  This front yielded 90 % of the month's rainfall, 
with no significant rainfall activity for the rest of the month, with the 
exception of the third week.
