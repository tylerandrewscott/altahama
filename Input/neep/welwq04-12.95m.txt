2.  Entry verification:

The data are directly downloaded in the YSI-PC6000 format (as a .dat file) and the Comma 
& ³ ³ 
Delimited format (as a .csv file) from the dataloggers to an IBM compatible lap-top (Epson 
Equity LT-
286e).  The data are reviewed using the PC6000 software.  Graphs and basic statistics are 
then generated 
with the PC6000 program and the information is printed out for each data file.  These graphs 
are used to 
determine any obvious data outliers and sonde and/or probe malfunction.  All downloaded data 
files from 
the dataloggers (both raw unedited .dat and .csv files) are then transferred via disk to a Power 
Mac 7100, 
where all files are reviewed and  formatted for CDMO and stored.  Here the raw unedited .csv 
data files 
are imported into Microsoft Excel 5.0.  After a complete month of data has been recorded, 
each file is 
ready to review which requires several steps.  The NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macros are 
used for all 
data.  A data file is created (from the merged raw unedited .csv data files) in Excel format 
with a full 
month of data.  The first step is to make sure that the parameter columns are in the correct 
order, 
specified by the NERR CDMO.  If any parameters are not collected due to probe failure or 
other causes, 
the cells with this missing data are filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in 
the 
appropriate section of the metadata.  Secondly, missing dates and times are inserted in the 
data file where 
data were not collected due to maintenance, sonde failure, etc., and the cells with this missing 
data are 
filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in the appropriate section of the 
metadata.  The 
first NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel 5.0 macro is then run to determine if there are any missing 
dates and 
times; and if so these missing dates and times are inserted.  Next, the second NERR CDMO 
QA/QC 
Excel 5.0 macro is used to find and filter all data readings outside the sonde specification 
measuring range 
for each parameter.  Here the ³outlier² data generated by the second macro are examined and 
determined 
as either explained or unexplained anomalies, as specified by NERR CDMO Operations 
Manual.  All 
anomalous data (explained and unexplained) are documented and explained in the appropriate 
sections of 
the metadata.  The explained anomalous data are then removed from the data file and 
replaced by 
periods.  The unexplained anomalous data are investigated for validity based on weather data, 
field 
observations, instrument diagnostics, and PC6000 printouts.  If these data are rejected from 
the file then 
these are removed and replaced by periods.  Lastly, the third and final NERR CDMO QA/QC 
Excel 5.0 
macro is used to reformat all the columns in the data file to the correct number of significant 
digits.  After 
this last step, once the file has been completely formatted and edited as specified by NERR 
CDMO, the 
file is saved as a Tab delimited (.txt) text file and sent by FTP to the CDMO.  The metadata 
form is also 
submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Scott Orringer is responsible for this task of entry 
verification with the analyses of suspect and anomalous data.  Michele Dionne supervises, 
proofs and 
answers questions with the evaluation of suspect and anomalous data.


3.  Research objectives:

	The Webhannet River estuary is located in proximity to heavily used beaches in 
Wells, Maine.  It has 
a shoreline that is highly developed with residential and commercial structures.  The estuary 
receives 
water from a 14 sq. mi. watershed that is well forested.  We are measuring variations in 
hydrologic 
variables in the Webhannet River estuary at the head of tide and at the inlet.  Data from head 
of tide will 
integrate surface and ground water inputs (from both point and non-point sources) from the 
freshwater 
watershed into the estuary.  Data from the inlet will integrate surface and ground water inputs 
from the 
freshwater watershed and the estuarine watershed.  Differences in data between the head of 
tide and the 
inlet will indicate inputs from the estuarine portion of the watershed (on the ebb tide), and 
inputs from 
the Gulf of Maine on the flood tide.  The instruments will track runoff events via salinity, 
and will 
measure pollutant-carrying sediment particles via turbidity.  Our working hypothesis is that 
the 
freshwater watershed is the primary source of sediment and therefore potential NPS 
pollutants in the 
estuary.  These two variables will indicate the potential for non-point source pollutants to 
enter the 
estuary, and whether they are of upland, estuarine or Gulf of Maine origin.  Other variables 
measured by 
the data loggers (DO, temperature, pH, specific conductivity, and water level) will provide 
important 
baseline data to track changes in the estuary's physico-chemical parameters over the long 
term.  These 
variables can be affected by changes in human water use, and by natural or human induced 
changes in 
inlet and river channel morphology, climate, and organic loadings.  The inlet site is heavily 
impacted at 
the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term monitoring site.  The head of tide site is 
relatively 
unimpacted, located just east of the Route One bridge, and is our ³roving² site.


4.  Research Methods

	The Wells NERR YSI monitoring program began in April 1995 at one site and May 
1995 at a second 
site in the Webhannet River estuary.  Both data loggers are installed with bottom moorings, 
as described 
below.  Each data logger was placed in a 4 inch diameter, 2 1/2 ft. long PVC pipe housing for 
protection.  
Several holes were cut out near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the 
probes.  There are 
three stainless steel bolts drilled into each PVC housing to hold the data logger in place.  Two 
bolts near 
the top allow the YSI to hang by its bail and one bolt near the bottom is placed just under the 
sonde 
guard.  Each PVC housing uses an underwater float and a surface buoy  attached to the outer 
top bolt 
with 3 feet of rope.  This allows the top end of the data logger to float freely while the 
probe-end is fixed 
to the bottom mooring.  Before deployment, duct tape is used to keep bolt nuts secure and 
clean.  Both 
data loggers have 1/4 inch vector mesh placed on the outside (using rubber bands) and bottom 
(using 
cable ties) of the sonde guard to prevent fouling.
	The head of tide site (HT) uses a steel sign post (hammered about 1.5 ft) for a 
bottom mooring, and 
two stainless steel clips are used to secure the probe-end of the data logger 0.45 meters (1.5 
ft) off the 
bottom.  One of these clips is attached to the sign post with a marine lock for security.  A 4-
lb. 
dansforth anchor is also clipped to the probe-end of the data logger with 20 ft of rope for 
secondary 
security measures.  
	The inlet site (IN) uses a 50 lb. mushroom anchor as a bottom mooring, with 15 ft of 
rope slack 
clipped and tied to the pier.  The inlet site is secured at 2 meters (6.5  ft) off the bottom 
using a stainless 
steel link attached to the rope.  The probe-end of the data logger was attached to this link 
with stainless 
steel clips (the buoys attached to other end of the housing).  Beginning on December 14 at 
13:30, after 
retrieval and calibration, the inlet data logger depth was changed and secured to 1.0 meter 
(3.28 ft) off the 
bottom, due to possible probe exposure at low tide.
	Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen due to limitations created by 
the life of the 
dissolved oxygen membrane and limited battery power.  Measurements of temperature, 
specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, pH, and water level are recorded 
at 15 
minute intervals throughout the deployment period.  After April 28 at 10:00, the logging 
interval was 
changed from 15 to 30 minutes (began logging every 30 minutes on 4/28 at 10:30).
	After the deployment period, the data loggers are brought back into the Wells 
Reserve Laboratory for 
downloading, cleaning, and calibration.  These procedures are carried out to the methods 
described in the 
YSI Operating Manual.  Calibration standards are needed and used for only specific 
conductivity 
(10mS/cm) and pH (buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10). Both standards are purchased from 
Fisher 
Scientific.  The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced and sit 6-24 hours before each 
deployment.  
After approximately 6-24 hours of down time for cleaning, maintenance and recalibration, 
the YSI Data 
loggers are redeployed for another sampling period.

	
5.  Site location and character    

	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York County, within the 
Town of Wells, 
on the coast of southern Maine and faces the Atlantic Ocean.  The Wells NERR is 
approximately 31 km 
(20 miles) south of Portland, Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, Massachusetts.  
The 
Reserve encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of Maine coastline of tidally-flushed 
wetlands, riparian 
and transitional upland fields and forests within the Little River Estuary and the larger 
Webhannet River 
Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in the sandy glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  
Both rivers 
empty into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles along the 
Atlantic coast.  
Bordering each river¹s inlet are double spit barrier beaches attached to the mainland.  The 
backbarrier 
system is approximately 5 sq. km and is composed of large intertidal marshes (predominantly 
S. patens 
and S. alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed for the 
Webhannet 
River estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 streams, brooks or creeks 
which enter the 
estuary.  These tributaries flow across sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the 
impermeable 
sandy muds of the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The Webhannet River is 
connected to 
the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a spring tidal prism of 28,200,000 m3 (Ward 1993). 
The force and volume of tidal action affect the salinity level of both rivers.  In the Wells 
region, the 
annual mean wave height is almost 20 inches.  The estuarine system is dominated by semi-
diurnal tides 
having a range of 8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into both estuaries is 
moderate to low 
(on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), especially in the summer, because of the rivers¹ 
relatively 
small drainage areas and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The relatively low flows from 
these two 
rivers taken in with the 20 inch per year average runoff of the area surrounding the estuaries 
combine to 
form a fresh water flow which is dwarfed by tidal flushing.  Twelve-foot tides dwarf the 
freshwater flow 
into the Webhannet estuary, which has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet 
estuary, fed 
by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and greatly developed land.  
It offers a 
valuable opportunity for comparison with the relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The 
land use of 
the Webhannet estuary include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh water, and tidal marsh; a 
total of 63.7 % 
for woodland; and a total of 18.6% for developed land (compared to a total of 5.7% 
development in the 
Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 1997).
	There are two sampling sites in the Webhannet River estuary.  These are located at 
the head of tide 
and at the inlet.  The tidal range at both of these sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.
	The head of tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just downstream 
of the Webhannet 
Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 deg 17¹ 00² Latitude, 70 deg 35¹ 30² 
Longitude).  
Route One is used heavily with traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  
This site 
has soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide depth is relatively 
shallow.  The 
salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean of 3.6 ppt.  These head waters of the Webhannet 
are 
relatively undeveloped. This site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is 
our ³roving² 
site.
	The inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the Wells Harbor 
pier (43 deg 19¹ 12² 
Latitude, 70 deg 33¹ 50² Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an 
extensive 
wetland/salt marsh area which is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most 
recently 
dredged in 1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing and recreational 
boats.  The 
mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the Atlantic Ocean.  This channel was 
dredged in 1974.  
This site has a predominately sand substrate and is characterized by strong current during 
incoming and 
outgoing tides.  The salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean of 31 ppt.  The inlet site is 
heavily 
impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term monitoring site.
	

6.  Data collection period:

	The Webhannet River head of tide (HT) site data collection began April 4, 1995, 
10:30:00, and was 
pulled December 14, 1995, 10:00:00, for the winter months to prevent ice damage.  This site 
gets a large 
amount of ice coverage from December through late March.
	The Webhannet River inlet (IN) site data collection began May 29, 1995, 13:00:00.  
The IN datalogger 
will be ongoing throughout the year and is considered our long-term monitoring site, as this 
site remains 
relatively ice-free.


7.  Associated researchers and projects

	The Research Program¹s volunteer water quality monitoring program (W.E.T.) has 
been monitoring 
fecal coliform contamination and other water quality parameters in the estuaries since 1991.  
W.E.T. 
(Watershed Evaluation Team) was established to characterize and monitor the aquatic 
environment of the 
Little and Webhannet River estuaries.  This program allows students from local schools and 
volunteers 
to participate in ³hands-on² scientific research and management activities at the Reserve.  
Information 
yielded by this effort is valuable as baseline data for research conducted at the Reserve and 
may help in 
guiding current management priorities.  Reserve staff with W.E.T. volunteers and students, 
working with 
the Town of Wells and the Maine Department of Marine Resources (DMR), have recently 
opened 
selected shellfish beds in the Webhannet River after seven years of closure.  This was a direct 
result of 
monitoring fecal coliform contamination (and other water quality parameters), which is the 
major source 
of non-point source pollution in southern Maine.  W.E.T. is part of a National Monitoring 
Program 
called Estuary-Net.  This program allows students to share their data and compare their 
results with 
other monitoring groups via the web.
	University of New Hampshire researchers completed a year long monitoring project 
measuring the 
volume, nutrient concentrations, and total suspended solids of freshwater discharge into the 
Webhannet 
River estuary, relating these inputs to precipitation, and measuring their effects on estuarine 
water 
quality; using a hydrolab.  Research staff and students have completed a four year study of 
hydrology 
and vegetation of a degraded Webhannet River marsh recovering from roadway impoundment 
after 
restoration of tidal flow.  In June of 1994, Reserve research staff and students completed an 
18 month 
survey of larval fish distribution and abundance in the Wells Reserve¹s estuaries and in the 
near-shore 
waters of Wells Bay. University of New Hampshire researchers are working with eelgrass beds 
in Wells 
Embayment to develop criteria for siting and evaluating eel grass restoration projects.  Both 
salt marsh 
and eelgrass are thought to be important habitats for many Gulf of Maine fishes. University 
of Maine 
Machias is collaborating with Reserve staff to determine the status of the soft-shell clam 
resource in the 
Reserve¹s estuaries.  Reserve staff are working with the Maine Dept. of Environmental 
Protection to 
survey the dissolved oxygen status of 25 estuaries throughout Maine, using data sondes to 
measure 
oxygen depletion as an indicator of non-point source pollution (Coastal Hypoxia Study).

12.  Other Remarks/Notes:

	-After April 28 at 12:45, the logging interval for the head of tide site (inlet site 
logger not deployed 
yet) was changed from 15 to 30 minutes (began logging every 30 minutes on 4/28 at 13:00).  
However, to 
create a full month data file at 15 minute intervals (recommended by CDMO); there are 
missing data at 
each 00:15:00 and 00:45:00 from 4/28 13:15 to 4/30 23:45.

	-No inlet data on 7/12 16:00 to 7/17 17:00 due to a needed DO probe for other state 
project (Coastal 
Hypoxia Study-see associated researchers and projects (#7 above)).  The Maine DEP DO 
probe failed 
and we needed to use ours for this other study.  We can compare this missing data to UNH¹s 
water 
quality monitoring (hydrolab was used) at the Webhannet inlet the previous year (also see #7 
above).

	-No head of tide data from 10/29 12:00 to 10/31 11:30 due to a pulled datalogger and 
moorings by 
Wells Police.  Wells Police removed datalogger and PVC shell from water to identify 
(mooring, buoys 
and all), and brought back to Wells NERR over the weekend.  Since the datalogger was taking 
dry 
readings on our lab floor all weekend, we chose to delete the suspect data, although these data 
looked 
very interesting!

	-Beginning on December 14 at 13:30, after retrieval and calibration, the inlet data 
logger depth was 
changed and secured to 1.0 meter (3.28 ft) off the bottom, due to possible probe exposure at 
low tide.

	-The inlet time variable changed during the time frame on 11/8 17:00 to 11/21 
10:30.  During this 
period, the time changed from 17:00:00=17:01:31, 17:30:00=17:31:31, etc., to 
10:30:00=10:31:31 on 
11/21.  On 11/21 15:00, after calibration, the time was back to normal.  This time 
differential was deleted 
during the strange time frame occurrence and changed back to normal for graphing and 
analysis purposes.

-Turbidity measurements began at both sites in 1996.
