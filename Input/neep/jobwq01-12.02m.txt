2. Entry verification:
 	After retrieving and carefully cleaning the data loggers, they are 
examined to detect any structural damage to the body or to the probes. The DO 
membrane is checked for ruptures and then replaced if needed. The turbidity 
probe is examined to assure that no obstruction affects the wiper and that the 
sensor is clean. Manipulation and observations are registered in the field log 
for each deployment respectively.
	The YSI is connected to a Pentium II 400 MHz IBM compatible computer and 
the data is reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowatch for Windows that 
accompanies the YSI 6000 data logger. The file is uploaded in two formats, one 
in YSI PC6000 format and the other in Comma "Delimited format then the file 
is renamed to have a ".txt" extension. The YSI Ecowatch for Windows program is 
used to plot the data and delete the pre and post deployment data that are not 
in range of the other readings. The program is used to perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.). Data is initially reviewed using 
the Ecowatch graphing tool. Data for a month is compiled into one single Excel 
2000 data sheet for further examination to detect gross outliers, and data 
recorded during instrument retrieval or caused by instrument failure. 
	Missing dates and times are checked before submitting the data to the 
Centralized Data Management Office. CDMO Excel macros are provided to assist in 
data reviewing and data editing. Data is opened with this program and empty or 
unrecorded data spaces are filled with periods. Columns are corrected for 
specific format (correct data size and number of decimal place holders are 
specified by the NERR CDMO). Data and time readings are also checked. This 
program also identifies outliers. The outliers file is saved and printed for 
revision of each file. Missing data and explanatory reasons are recorded in the 
Anomalous data section of this metadata. 
	Data that is found to be out of the instrument range or normal parameters 
for each sampling station is removed from the file and a period is inserted into 
the cell(s). Explanations for changes in data are also included in the metadata. 
Data that is outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site 
is investigated for validity based on field observation, QC check, Ecowatch for 
Windows print outs, and the instrument diagnostics. The metadata form is 
submitted with the data to the CDMO. The data is stored in Zip and CD disks. The 
person responsible for the data QA/QC is Iris L. Tirado.


3. Research Objectives:
  	Four data loggers are deployed in Jobos Bay. Two are deployed in inner 
lagoons of the Mar Negro Component and the other two in the Bay of the Jobos Bay 
National Estuarine Research Reserve. The instruments are suspended from a pole 
at a distance of 0.3 meters from the bottom at each selected site. Data from 
stations 9, 10, 19 and 20 are being submitted to the Centralized Data Management 
Office as part of the System-Wide Monitoring Program. Measurements are taken at 
thirty-minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. The sites are 
identified as representative of areas within the reserve and comparable to the 
sites that may be receiving impact from human activities from surroundings areas 
or may act as a habitat gradient in the Bay. 
	Station number nine (9), the impacted site, collects water quality data in 
a site associated with runoff from littoral and basin mangrove areas. This 
sampling station is located in the most inland lagoon, closest to the 
Thermoelectric Power Plant. It is subjected to runoff, which may include 
potential oil spill contamination from this industrial facility. Information 
compiled from historical environmental documents, indicate that station nine (9) 
was used as a disposal site for residues of the previously operating sugar mill 
operation, and therefore might have high organic input into the sediments.
	Station number ten (10), located in a mangrove lagoon area towards the 
southwestern section of Mar Negro is considered the reference or non-impacted 
site.	Station number(19) is located over a sea grass bed(Thalassia testudinum) 
in the inner western part of the bay just northeast of Cayo Colchones. This 
station is located near the thermal outfall and operating piers of the Aguirre 
Power Plant Complex, both activities may have significant effects on sea grass 
communities. This area is exposed to barge standings, sediment re-suspension and 
oil sills. 
	 Station number (20) is located on the eastern inner bay section of the 
Cayos Caribe cays. This station is just south of the mangrove islets associated 
with the Reserve's coral reefs. Water streams coming through the coral platform 
may help characterize water conditions of the main marine currents reaching 
Jobos Bay, as well as, possible effects of industrial and chemical activities 
associated with Phillips Core, AES Coal Energy Plant and Pharmaceuticals located 
just east to this system.

4.	Research methods:
 	The National Estuarine Research Reserve Water Quality Monitoring Program 
began sampling at Station nine (9) on December 20, 1995 and Station ten (10) on 
February 1, 1996. Monitoring at station 19 began in April 2002 and at station 20 
in May 2002. Long term water quality monitoring is being performed at these 
stations.
         Before each YSI 6000 data logger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer's instruction (YSI Manual 
addendum 7/94, sections 3, 4 and 7). Calibration standards are only required for 
pH, salinity, and turbidity, all other parameters are done as described in the 
manual. Buffer solutions for two-point calibration (pH 7 and pH 10) are 
purchased from a scientific supply company. Salinity is calibrated with a 
specific conductance standard 100 mS/cm and is purchased from a scientific 
supply company.
         The two-point turbidity calibration is performed using a 0 NTU (DI 
water) and 100 NTU standard purchased from a scientific company. The dissolved 
oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 
24 hours prior to deployment. Weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in 
the field observation log during deployment. Measurements of DO, pH, salinity, 
specific conductance, and temperature, are taken with other calibrated field 
instruments to check the accuracy of the instrumentation.
	Each YSI data logger is tied with steel cable to a wrought iron galvanized 
pole, which is plunged into the sediments at each sampling area.  Data loggers 
are suspended from a pole at 0.3 meter from the bottom of the selected site. 
Every 30 minutes during the sampling period, the following measurements are 
recorded: date, time, temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved 
oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, pH, and turbidity. 
Every two weeks the data loggers are retrieved, uploaded, cleaned, inspected, 
and calibrated as noted previously. The data logger is then ready to be deployed 
again.

5. Site location and character:
 	The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JBNERR) is located on 
the southern coastal plain of the island of Puerto Rico, a reserve within the 
West Indies geographical area. JBNERR is composed of two major areas: (1) Mar 
Negro, located on the western margin of the Bay, and (2) Cayos Caribe, a chain 
of 15 tear-shaped islets located to the southeast. The Mar Negro area comprises 
the bulk of the Reserve, and consists of mangrove forests and a complex system 
of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats.  Coral reefs and 
sea grass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas fringe Cayos Caribe 
mangrove islands.
 	Station 9 is an impacted site and is located on the northeastern section 
of the Mar Negro component. This sampling station is associated with mangrove 
lagoon areas and receives runoff from mudflats, the Thermoelectric Power Plant, 
and adjacent areas. The tidal range varies from 12 to 14 inches near the 
monitoring station. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station 
varies from 26.0 ppt to 41.1 ppt. The average depth at station 09 is 1 meter. 
The bottom is covered by a thick layer of thin sediments with a high content of 
organic material. Brown and green algae are also present at this site, but a 
better assessment is needed. The station pole is located at 17° 56' 36.8" N and 
66° 14' 18.5" W.  Fresh water input to the station comes only from runoff and 
rain.  There is not any direct source of fresh water.

 	Station 10 is located in a mangrove lagoon not impacted directly by any 
upland or marine activities. It provides a reference for comparison of data 
obtained in other stations, especially to the station in Mar Negro lagoon.  The 
tidal range varies from 12 to 14 inches. The salinity at the vicinity of the 
monitoring station varies from 27.0 ppt to 41.7 ppt. The average depth at 
station 10 is 1 meter. The bottom is covered with a layer of fine sediments with 
organic material, followed by a layer of calcareous material mainly from shells 
and oysters. At this site, we can find sea grass (Thalassia), calcareous algae 
(Halimeda sp.), green algae (Caulerpa sp.) and brown algae (Dictyota sp.) among 
others. The pole is located at 17° 56' 20.3" N and 66° 45' 26.7" W. Fresh water 
input to the station comes only from runoff and rain.  There is not any direct 
source of fresh water.

 	Station 19 is located on the western inner section of the bay at a 
distance of 233 meters from Cayo Colchones Mangroves over sea grass beds 
(Thallasia testudinum). Tidal ranges in this area vary from 12 to 14 inches. The 
salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 30.0 ppt to 36.0 
ppt. The average depth at this station is of 2 meters. The YSI' sonde is 
deployed at about 1 foot from the bottom. The bottom is of sandy composition. 
Sea grass, algae, echinoderms and other related organisms could be found in the 
area. The pole is located at 17° 56' 28.15885" N and 66° 13' 45.28784" W.  There 
is no freshwater input to this area.

	Station 20 is located in the inner eastern section at about 190 meters of 
Cayos Caribe Mangrove islets and at about 688 meters from the coral reef 
barrier. This station is the closest to Mar Caribe. It has a sandy bottom, with 
calcareous and coral fragments, sea grass (Thalassia) communities, echinoderms 
and other associated organisms.  Tidal ranges in this area vary from 12 to 14 
inches. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 30.0 
ppt to 36.0 ppt. The average depth of the site is 2 meters. There is no 
freshwater input to this area. The pole is located at 17° 55' 49.14258" N and 
66° 12' 41.29771" W.

  	Data from stations 9, 10, 19 and 20 is being submitted to the CDMO. Eight 
sondes are permanently devoted to taking readings from these two sites, to 
assure continuous readings while sondes are taken out of the water for data 
upload and maintenance. This will avoid data gaps for the stations between sonde 
maintenance procedures.	Due to errors in calibration, turbidity data in these 
files is considered inadequate. All monitoring is considered long term.

8. Associated researchers and projects:
	
	As part of the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program, monthly samples for 
nutrients and chlorophyll were conducted from July to December 2002. Nutrient 
Sampling at Station 9 is conducted using an ISCO sampler, which collects samples 
every two hours during a twenty-four hour period. Grab samples are also 
collected in all four YSI monitoring stations. Analysis of the samples is being 
performed by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, VIMS, in Virginia.

Another project is the water monitoring program for Ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, 
ortho-phosphate, chlorophyll and pheophytin.  For this, an ISCO 6712 Portable 
Sampler is used.  The sample is an automatic instrument that can be easily moved 
from site to site.  Constructed from durable, corrosion-resistant materials, the 
sampler withstands the hostile environments of industrial and municipal 
monitoring sites.  It is located at one of our four principal, long-term 
stations and it is programmed to take samples every two hours.  The samples are 
collected every month following an established protocol and sent to the Virginia 
Institute of Marine Sciences for further analysis.

DO (%) and DO (mg/l) data suspected wrong from 05/25/02 to 05/31/02. This 
station shows peaks of high oxygen values and periods of high oxygen consumption 
on several occasions caused by high algae concentrations and fouling of the 
sonde.

12. Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by any period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
Anomalous Data Section (11.) To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other remarks:

During this year, great part of the data obtained by the turbidity sensor have 
negative values and was eliminated.  This year 2002, we have changed the sensor 
model for turbidity near summer, this required to make adjustments to the 
turbidity standard, which improved the turbidity data.  Although, we continue 
obtaining negative values but more closer to zero.

Station 19:  From 06/08/02 to 06/11/02. During this period salinity and specific 
conductivity decreased because of a raining event.

Station 19:  From 07/29/02 to 08/14/02.  During this period we found high DO (%) 
and DO (mg/l) values because of strong winds that hit the watershed on hurricane 
season.

Station 19:  From 10/09/02 to 10/28/02.  An oxygen decreased occurs, caused by 
biofouling on the sensors, the sonde stays on the water more than 15 days.
