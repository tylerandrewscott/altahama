2.  Entry Verification:
The data is directly downloaded in a spreadsheet format from the YSI 6000 upg 
datalogger to a PC.  Edited files are created by removing the headers, footers, 
and spaces on a PC.  Missing data from YSI 6000 maintenance (downtime) is 
inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Data and graphs 
are visually inspected to find possible anomalies.  Edited and raw files are 
currently stored on 3.5-inch diskettes.  [Edited and raw data will be archived 
and stored on IBM 41T workstation].  Data files were QA/QC’d using Excel 5.0 
CDMO macros.  Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited 
and merged monthly files are also transferred to NERRS Central Data Management 
Office.  Nasreen Faqiri was responsible for the editing and archiving of these 
data from April 95 through September 96; James Hewes is responsible from 
November 96 to the present, June 98.

Some data were collected using Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT).  The 
following procedure was used to correct the data.  We performed this procedure 
after Column Reformat and prior to Find Variable Outliers for all affected 
files.Rename the current file xxxxxxdt.xls, where xxxxxx is the standard CDMO 
filename.  Copy the first two rows of data from the subsequent monthly file and 
paste to the end of the current file.  Copy the first two rows of data in the 
current file and paste to the end of the previous monthly file.  Delete the 
first two rows of data from the current file.  Select the time column.  Run the 
timechg macro in EDTtoEST.xls.  Confirm that the time change is correct.  Select 
the data column.  Run the datechg macro in EDTtoEST.xls. Confirm that the date 
change is correct.  Save the file as xxxxxx.xls.

3.  Research Objectives:
Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over two week periods at two sites in 
the St. Jones River component and one site in the Blackbird Creek component of 
Delaware's National Estuarine Research Reserve.  The St. Jones River is impacted 
by urbanization upstream and extensive agricultural activity throughout the 
basin.  The Blackbird Creek is one of the least impacted riverine systems in 
Delaware.

4.  Research Methods:
The YSI 6000 datalogger monitoring program was started in July 1995 at Scotton 
Landing (St. Jones River) and Blackbird Landing (Blackbird Creek).  In June 1996 
Penrose Branch (St. Jones River Basin) was added to the monitoring program.  
Prior to deployment, a 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC pipe was mounted to a piling 
at Scotton Landing and a bridge at Blackbird Landing and Penrose Branch using 
stainless steel brackets and bolts.  Each YSI 6000 is lowered into the PVC pipe 
that has eight (8) two-inch diameter holes cut out at the bottom for the probes 
to have direct contact with the water column.  A large stainless steel bolt was 
placed at the bottom end of the PVC pipe which maintained each YSI 6000 at each 
site exactly one foot (30 cm) above the river bottom.  Every half-hour over a 
two-week period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and water level are recorded.  
Seven days after the deployment of each YSI 6000, the dissolved oxygen membrane 
is cleaned with a Kimwipe dipped in methanol.  Two-week sampling intervals were 
selected due to limitations created by the dissolved oxygen membrane.  At the 
end of each two-week period, the YSI 6000 is brought back to the office for 
downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Calibrations performed include: 
dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity using Oakton 12,880 uS standard, 
turbidity using AMCO AEPO-1 Standard at 100 NTU and distilled water, pH using 
Fisher pH 4.00, 7.00 and 10.00 buffers, and depth.  These procedures are carried 
out according to the methods as described in the YSI Model 6000 Operating and 
Service Manual.  After approximately six hours of down time for cleaning and 
recalibration, the YSI 6000's are redeployed for another two-week period. Data 
files are QA/QC’d using Excel 5.0 CDMO macros.  Edited files are merged to 
contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged monthly files are also 
transferred to NERRS Central Data Management Office.

5.  Site location and character:
The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component 
sites, the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are 
located along the Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located 
in central Kent County Delaware, east of the State Capitol City, Dover.  The 
Blackbird Creek component is located in the unincorporated area of Southern New 
Castle County.  There are three sampling sites, two located in St. Jones 
component and one in the Blackbird Creek component.
1) Scotton Landing - is located in the Lower St. Jones River at the Scotton 
Landing Public Fishing Pier, just up stream of Delaware Route 113.  The site 
is influenced by freshwater runoff from the relatively urbanized area 
upstream.  Salinity ranges from 8 - 30 ppt.
		  Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) – 1.26   
		  Neap Mean (m) – 1.13
Position:  Latitude     39 degree 05'  05.9160"  N
           Longitude  75 degree 27'  38.1049"  W
2) Blackbird Landing - is located in the upper Blackbird Creek at Blackbird 
Landing Road.  The site is influenced by freshwater runoff from unimpacted 
forested areas intermixed with agricultural land uses and a small amount of low-
density development.  Salinity ranges from 2-7 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) – 1.12
			  Neap Mean (m) – 1.13
            Position:  Latitude      39 degree 23'  19.5196"  N
		           Longitude   75 degree 38'  09.5882"  W
3)Penrose Branch - is located in the headwaters of the St. Jones Basin, north of 
Dover and along Pearsons Corner Road.  The site is predominately a forested 
wetland tributary system with agricultural landaus along the subcatchments 
fringe.  Salinity is 0.00 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Not Applicable, freshwater 
	Position:	Latitude      39 degree 09'  52.77"  N
		      Longitude   75 degree 39'  01.52"  W

6.  Data collection period:
Scotton Landing data collection began on July 1, 1995.  Blackbird Landing data 
collection began on July 14, 1995. Penrose Branch data collection began on June 
1,1996.  All sampling is ongoing.

7.  Associated researchers and projects: 
An extensive stormwater sampling and hydrodynamic modeling project is underway 
in the upper reaches of the St. Jones River Basin.  This project includes flow 
weighted stormwater sampling to quantify pollutant loads from each of the major 
land uses found in the Basin.An additional stormwater sampling program is 
underway to analyze the impact of agricultural BMP's at sites in the Blackbird 
Creek Watershed, St. Jones River Watershed.A joint effort underway through 
NOAA's Center for Coastal Ecosystem Health and the DNERR characterization 
studies will initiate detailed monthly water quality sampling at three sites in 
each river over a two year period and will quantify the phytoplankton community 
with collections from the same sites.   This project was scheduled to be 
initiated in February 1995.(See Section I.1. for research contacts.)

C. Penrose Branch
a) The data between July 26, 1996 16:00:00 through August 8, 1996 09:30:00 are

value, 
0330, reason not 
apparent, although may be related to a rain event.  Data retained.
c) Turbidity (NTU) values between October 10, 1996 at 17:00:00 have a large 
positive value, 
0422, 
reason not apparent, although may be related to a rain event.  Data retained.
