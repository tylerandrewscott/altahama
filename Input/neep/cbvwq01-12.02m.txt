2. Entry verification
The data were uploaded to a C from either YSI 6000 or 6600 dataloggers and 
reviewed using PC6000/6600 software from YSI.  Graphs were produced and examined 
using the PC6000/6600 software then printed out and filed.  Next, files were 
uploaded in comma-delimited format, which were opened in Excel 5.0 software and 
edited to remove extraneous information (headers, footers, spaces, and pre- and 
post-deployment data).  Monthly templates were used to form complete sets of 
monthly data sets.  Macros supplied by NERRS/CDMO were used to help with 
editing, formatting and identifying outliers in the database. The CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls macro allowed the user to automatically format column widths and to 
adjust value decimal places based on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allowed 
the user to QA/QC each datalogger generated file for missing data points, fill 
all cells that do not contain data with periods (.), and find all data points 
that fell outside (ie. outliers) the measurement range of the YSI 6000/6600 
instrumentation. Outliers were determined according to the instruments' 
manufacturers manual. Suspect data (as in data believed to result from a damaged 
or biofouled probe) were evaluated according to Appendix B of the CDMO manual, 
edited and documented. Missing data due to YSI maintenance (downtime) was 
inserted into the spreadsheet and was denoted by periods (.).  Edited and raw 
data files were copied and archived in the CBNERRVA file server and uploaded to 
the CDMO FTP site. Following final editing, the database was uploaded to the 
CBNERRVA server and to CDMO.   Joy Austin was the individual who was responsible 
for the entry verification tasks.


3. Research Objectives

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Goodwin Islands represent marsh islands surrounded by intertidal flats, 
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, oyster reefs, and shallow open 
estuarine waters.  Because minimal human activities occur within upland 
portions, the Goodwin Islands are suitable as a reference or control site for 
non-point source water quality issues.  Furthermore, due to extensive wetlands, 
intertidal, and submerged habitats, the Goodwin Islands are used extensively for 
SAV, material flux, fisheries science and trophic interaction research 
activities.  

Claybank (CB) Component:
The Claybank site represents a shallow (<2m) littoral area approximately 300-400 
meters in width and located within the mesohaline portion of the York River 
estuary. Prior to 1972, this area supported submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) 
but current conditions are not conducive to SAV survival.  This site is used 
extensively to study sediment dynamics and environmental stress on SAV.  

Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain, rural 
watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This watershed is 
dominated by forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land 
use component.  The drainage basin is suited for investigating hydrologic and 
non-point source water quality issues associated with changing land use 
patterns.   

Sweethall Landing (SH) Component:
Sweet Hall Marsh is the most downriver extensive tidal freshwater marsh located 
in the Pamunkey River, one of two major tributaries of the York River.  Research 
activities are currently addressing the impacts of salinity intrusion due to 
relative sea level rise.  In addition, Sweet Hall Marsh has been used 
extensively to study general ecology and material flux within tidal freshwater 
marshes.


4. Research methods 

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality monitoring 
station at Goodwin Islands.  This station is located on the southeastern side of 
the main island in a shallow embayment, approximately 400 meters from shore.  A 
stable and permanent structure, consisting of a 4-inch PVC pipe housed within a 
galvanized steel tower, was built in October 1997.  The lower portion of the PVC 
pipe was milled to allow for water circulation within the pipe and around the 
datalogger sensors.  The datalogger is suspended so that the sensors are 
maintained 0.5 m from the bottom substrate.  A YSI 6600 unvented datalogger was 
used to measure specific conductivity, pH, depth, percent dissolved oxygen 
saturation, temperature, and turbidity at 15-minute intervals throughout the 
2002 deployment year.  Salinity and dissolved oxygen concentration are 
calculated parameters.  At approximately one to two-week intervals, the 
datalogger was returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, membrane 
replacement and recalibration. Maintenance intervals vary from year to year and 
site-to-site depending on the amount of biofouling and expected battery life. In 
general, YSI dataloggers were deployed for two-week intervals from early October 
to the end of May and one-week intervals from the beginning of June to late 
September. A second YSI datalogger was deployed following retrieval of the 
original YSI datalogger in order to maintain a continuous record.  Field 
verification samples for pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were 
taken during the deployment/retrieval procedure.  PH was measured in the lab 
with a Orion pH meter model 370.  Dissolved oxygen was determined by Winkler 
titration.  Salinity was determined by using a Rosemount analytical induction 
salinometer.  Temperature was field measured with a long-stem glass thermometer.  
All YSI procedures are in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, 
Sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH were purchased from Fisher.  Standards for 
conductivity were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity standards were purchased from 
Advanced Polymer Systems.  Data are reviewed and edited according to the YSI 
Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO manual.


Clay Bank (CB) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality monitoring 
station at Clay Bank.  The station is located within a shallow (<2m) littoral 
area approximately 300-400 meters wide.  A stable structure which consists of a 
6-inch PVC pipe attached to a piling, was built in January 2001.  The lower 
portion of the PVC pipe was milled to allow for water circulation within the 
pipe and around the datalogger sensors.  The datalogger is suspended so that 
sensors are located 0.25 m from the bottom substrate.  Both a YSI 6600 vented 
and YSI 6600 unvented datalogger was used to measure specific conductivity, pH, 
depth, percent dissolved oxygen saturation, temperature, and turbidity at 15-
minute intervals throughout the 2002 deployment year (see Section 6 for 
instrument deployment intervals).  Salinity and dissolved oxygen are calculated 
parameters.  At approximately one to two-week intervals, the datalogger was 
returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, membrane replacement and 
recalibration. Maintenance intervals vary from year to year and site-to-site 
depending on the amount of biofouling and expected battery life. In general, YSI 
dataloggers were deployed for two-week intervals from early October to the end 
of May and one-week intervals from the beginning of June to late September. A 
second YSI datalogger was deployed following retrieval of the original YSI 
datalogger in order to maintain a continuous record.  Field verification samples 
for pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were taken during the 
deployment/retrieval procedure.  PH was measured in the lab with a Orion pH 
meter model 370.  Dissolved oxygen was determined by Winkler titration.  
Salinity was determined by using a Rosemount analytical induction salinometer.  
Temperature was field measured with a long-stem glass thermometer.  All YSI 
procedures are in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, Sections 3 
and 7.  Standards for pH were purchased from Fisher.  Standards for conductivity 
were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity standards were purchased from Advanced 
Polymer Systems.  Data are reviewed and edited according to the YSI Data Review 
and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO manual.


Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality
monitoring station at Taskinas Creek.  The station is located near the mouth of 
Taskinas Creek where the tidal marsh creek converges with the York River 
estuary.  A simple deployment, consisting of a suspended wire attached to an 
overhanging tree, was established in September 1995.  The datalogger was 
suspended at a fixed depth approximately 0.5 m above the creek-bed.  In 
September 1997, the deployment was modified so that the datalogger remained 
secure and stable at all times within a 4-inch PVC housing attached to a piling 
system. The lower portion of the PVC pipe was milled to allow for water 
circulation within the pipe and around the datalogger sensors.  The datalogger 
was suspended so that the sensors are maintained 0.5 m above the bottom 
substrate.  Both a YSI 6000 unvented and YSI 6600 EDS unvented datalogger were 
used to measure specific conductivity, pH, depth, percent dissolved oxygen 
saturation, temperature, and turbidity at 15-minute intervals throughout the 
2002 deployment year (see Section 6 for instrument deployment intervals).  
Salinity and dissolved oxygen are calculated parameters.  At approximately one 
to two-week intervals, the datalogger was returned to the lab for downloading, 
cleaning, membrane replacement and recalibration. Maintenance intervals vary 
from year to year and site-to-site depending on the amount of biofouling and 
expected battery life. In general, YSI dataloggers were deployed for two-week 
intervals from early October to the end of May and one-week intervals from the 
beginning of June to late September. A second YSI datalogger was deployed 
following retrieval of the original YSI datalogger in order to maintain a 
continuous record.  Field verification samples for pH, dissolved oxygen, 
salinity, and temperature were taken during the deployment/retrieval procedure.  
PH was measured in the lab with a Orion pH meter model 370.  Dissolved oxygen 
was determined by Winkler titration.  Salinity was determined by using a 
Rosemount analytical induction salinometer.  Temperature was field measured with 
a long-stem glass thermometer.  All YSI procedures are in accordance with the 
YSI operating manual methods, Sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH were purchased 
from Fisher.  Standards for conductivity were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity 
standards were purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems.  Data are reviewed and 
edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of 
the CDMO manual.



Sweethall Landing (SH) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality station at 
Sweet Hall Marsh.  This station is located adjacent to a low-use boathouse where 
a 6-inch PVC pipe is attached to an adjacent pier piling.  The datalogger was 
suspended so that the sensors remained 0.7 m from the bottom substrate.  A YSI 
6000 unvented datalogger used to measure specific conductivity, pH, depth, 
percent dissolved oxygen saturation, temperature, and turbidity at 15-minute 
intervals throughout the 2002 deployment year (see Section 6 for instrument 
deployment intervals).  Salinity and dissolved oxygen are calculated parameters.  
At approximately one to two-week intervals, the datalogger was returned to the 
lab for downloading, cleaning, membrane replacement and recalibration. 
Maintenance intervals vary from year to year and site-to-site depending on the 
amount of biofouling and expected battery life. In general, YSI dataloggers were 
deployed for two-week intervals from early October to the end of May and one-
week intervals from the beginning of June to late September. A second YSI 
datalogger was deployed following retrieval of the original YSI datalogger in 
order to maintain a continuous record.  Field verification samples for pH, 
dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature were taken during the 
deployment/retrieval procedure.  PH was measured in the lab with a Orion pH 
meter model 370.  Dissolved oxygen was determined by Winkler titration.  
Salinity was determined by using a Rosemount analytical induction salinometer.

procedures are in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, Sections 3 
and 7.  Standards for pH were purchased from Fisher.  Standards for conductivity 
were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity standards were purchased from Advanced 
Polymer Systems.  Data are reviewed and edited according to the YSI Data Review 
and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO manual.


5.  Site location and character

(a) Goodwin Islands (37 deg 13' 02.65"; 76 deg 23' 32.76")

The Goodwin Islands component of  CBNERRVA is located on the southern side of 
the mouth of the York River. The station is located approximately 400 meters 
from shore, with and average water depth on the order of 1m. Goodwin Islands are 
a 315 ha (777 acre) archipelago of salt-marsh islands surrounded by inter-tidal 
flats and extensive beds of submerged aquatic vegetation (121 ha; 300 acres) 
dominated by eelgrass (Zostera marina) and Widgeon grass (Ruppia maritime).  
Water circulation patterns around the island are influenced by York River 
discharge and wind patterns of the Chesapeake Bay. Tides at the Goodwin Islands 
are semi-diurnal and display an average range of 0.7 m (range: 0.4 - 1.1 m).  
Water quality conditions described here are from data recorded between October 
1997 and December 1998. During this period mean water temperature at the Goodwin 
Islands sampling station ranged from 7 °C in winter to 27 °C in summer. Minimum 
and maximum water temperatures recorded were 2.3 °C (January) and 31.6 °C 
(July). Mean monthly salinity ranged from 9.9 ppt (January) to 27.5 ppt 
(November). Mean salinity was greatest (23-25 ppt) during the summer and fall 
and lowest (13-15 ppt) during the winter and spring. Mean dissolved oxygen 
readings were typically near saturation during this time period except between 
July-August. Dissolved oxygen readings ranged from 23.6% (October) to 195.7% 
saturation (May); hypoxia is rarely observed. The data logger probes are located 
0.5 m above the sandy substrate bottom. Potential activities that could impact 
the site include light recreational and commercial boating activity.


(b) Claybank (37 deg 20' 51.58"; 76 deg 36' 37.52")

The Claybank station is loaded within a shallow (<2m) littoral area 
approximately 300-400 meters wide along the mesohaline portion of the York River 
estuary.  The site is approximately 26 km upriver from the mouth of the estuary.  
The shoreline consists of a narrow fringe of salt marsh with some areas armored 
with bulkhead or stone. Tidal range is on the order of 0.85 meters.  This 
station is located along the north shoreline of the estuary in an area that 
historically (prior to 1972) supported submersed aquatic vegetation.  The 
sampling station is influenced by a secondary turbidity maximum that moves back 
and forth in a region of about 20-40 km from the mouth of the York River 
estuary.  Substrate within the region varies from fine sediments to sand.  The 
site is exposed to strong winds from the northwest and re-suspension of sediment 
during storm events can be high.  In 1998 observed surface water temperatures 
ranged from 6 °C to 28 °C and salinities from 5 ppt to 20 ppt.  


(c) Taskinas Creek (37 deg 24' 53.86"; 76 deg 42' 51.82")

Taskinas Creek Reserve, component of CBNERRVA, encompasses 397 ha (980acres) and 
is located within the boundaries of York River State Park near the town of 
Croaker, Virginia.  The small sub-estuary of the York River is located on the 
southern side of the river, approximately 37 km up river from the mouth of the 
York River.  The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal 
plain, rural watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system. The watershed 
is dominated by forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing 
residential land use component. The non-tidal portion of Taskinas Creek contains 
feeder streams that drain oak-hickory forests, maple-gum-ash swamps and 
freshwater marshes. Freshwater mixed wetlands are found in the upstream reaches 
of Taskinas Creek.  The creek is roughly 2 meters deep and 20 meters wide 
towards the lower end of the creek where substrate is dominated by fine 
sediment.  Mean tide range is 0.85 m.  Mean water temperature from 1997 to 1998 
was 5-7 °C during the winter and 26-28 °C in the summer. The minimum and maximum 
water temperature recorded between 1996-1998 was - 0.7 °C in January of 1996 and 
35.1 °C in July 1998. For 1997-1998, mean salinity in Taskinas Creek was on the 
order of 14-16 ppt in the summer and 3-5 ppt in the winter. Minimum and maximum 
salinity recorded in 1996 - 1998 was 0.1 ppt in March 1996 and 20.3 ppt in 
November 1998. Mean dissolved oxygen values in 1996 and 1997 were lowest in the 
summer and greatest in the winter. Mean dissolved oxygen values below 50% 
saturation were only observed during parts of July 1996 and June 1997. Hypoxia 
was rarely observed and when present, lasted less than 2% of the time. Mean 
dissolved oxygen readings > 100% saturation (supersaturation) frequently 
observed. Potential activities that could impact the site include residential 
development, selective hardwood logging, and light recreational boating 
activity.  Wildlife populations have been shown to influence microbiological 
water quality within the watershed.


(d) Sweethall Marsh (37 deg 34' 16.94"; 76 deg 53' 02.78")

Sweet Hall Marsh is the most downriver extensive tidal freshwater marsh located 
in the Pamunkey River, one of two major tributaries of the York River.  The 
marsh is located approximately 77 km upriver from the mouth of the York River 
estuary. The reserve is 353 ha (871 acres) in area and includes 331 ha (818 
acres) of emergent fresh-water marsh, 14 ha (35 acres) of permanently flooded 
broad-leaved forested wetlands and approximately 4 ha (9 acres) of scrub-shrub. 
The marsh community is classified as freshwater mixed.  Mean tidal range at 
Sweet Hall Marsh is on the order of 0.9 m.  The Pamunkey River, which surrounds 
Sweet Hall Marsh, can reach depths up to 15 meters.  Substrate within the 
littoral zone and channel is dominated by fine sediment.  Based on 2002 data, 
mean monthly water temperature ranged from 5-8 °C during the winter and 26-29 °C 
in the summer. The minimum and maximum-recorded water temperature was 3.3 °C in 
December and 32.6 °C in July.  Mean monthly salinity was on the order of 1-4 ppt 
in the winter and 6-11 ppt in the summer.  Minimum and maximum salinity recorded 
in 2002 was 0.0 ppt in January, February, November and December and 15.7 ppt in 
October.  Potential activities that could impact the site include minor 
municipal point source discharges above and below river of Sweet Hall Marsh, a 
major industrial discharge site (pulp mill) in the town of West Point and 
significant groundwater withdrawal near the confluence of the Pamunkey and York 
Rivers.

6.  Data collection period:
Sampling at Goodwin Islands (GI), Sweethall Marsh (SH), and Taskinas Creek (TC) 
began January 2002. Sampling was continuous through December 2002. Sampling was 
intermittent at Claybank (CB) from January 2002 to May 15,2002.  Continuous 
sampling began on May 16, 2002 and continued to December 2002.  Please note: 
Occasional time skips occurred at all sites due to low batteries, water leakage 
into the battery compartment, and for no apparent reason.

11.  Data anomalies (suspect data):
Frequent data anomalies were recorded in depth levels for several months 
potentially due to low-pressure weather fronts.  This data remained in the 
database.  Standard calibration protocols for the non-vented sensor use the 
atmospheric pressure at the time of calibration.  Therefore, changes in 
atmospheric pressure between calibrations appears as changes in water depth.  
The error is equal to approximately 1.03cm for every 1 millibar change in 
atmospheric pressure.  Specific dates and time ranges of potentially influenced 
data are listed with each respective month.  Starting with January, data were 
extracted in accordance with Version 3.0 of the CDMO Manual.

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Remarks

A) Depth measurements were determined with non-vented pressure transducers and 
therefore depth data should be considered relative depth. Negative depth values 
can be due to extremely low water conditions, low-pressure systems, or probes 
being out of the water.  In the event where probes were clearly out of the 
water, as verified by specific conductance values, data were deleted.  When 
specific conductance values did not indicate probe exposure, negative depth 
values were retained and data was marked as suspect. 

B) Due to conductance calibration error that occurred on a few occasions, 
salinity values were adjusted based on field verification samples taken at each 
datasonde deployment and retrieval. Datasonde specific conductance data were 
deleted and replaced with periods. Corrected salinity values are presented in 
edited and raw data files. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were recalculated 
based on equations provided by APHA Standard Methods 1989. No 
changes were made to raw % dissolved oxygen saturation data.

C) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them. 

D) On a few occasions, turbidity spikes >300 NTU and <1000 NTU were noted to 
occur during low water conditions.  These data were marked as suspect and may be 
a result of resuspended sediment due to wave action.

E) When a particular sample appears twice, at the end of one deployment and at 
the beginning of another, the file that most closely resembles the existing 
trend was kept.  

F) Please note: Time skips can occur due to low batteries, water leakage 
into the battery compartment, and for no apparent reason.
