EPA has been working with the States to realign programs to strengthen support for watershed-based environmental protection, wherby local stakeholders join forces to develop and implement watershed-based plans that make good sense for the particulat conditions found within the communities.  The watershed approach is a coordinating framework for management that focuses public and private sector efforts to address the highest priority water-related problems within geographic areas, considering both surface and ground water flow. The watershed approach is commonly characterized by four principles: a)diverse, well integrated partnerships; b) a specific geographic focus; c) action driven by environmental objectives and by strong science and data; and d) coordinated priority setting and integrated solutions.",103335969,Water,,2004,2004,4,3,Awarded98976504,127625748,406300930,119423291,Nonpoint Source Management Program,C9,Nonpoint Source Implementation Program,CEP,Roy Begay,775-773-2002,Stephanie Wilson,775-885-6190,22-Feb-05,1-Oct-04,30-Sep-05,185531,Walker River Paiute Tribe,P.O.
