2.  Entry verification
The data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI dataloggers. Data plots were 
produced and examined using the PC6000 software. Files were also uploaded to a 
PC in a comma delimited format. Comma delimited files are opened in EXCEL 5.0 
software and edited by removing unnecessary headers, footers and spaces.  
Suspect data are evaluated, edited, and documented.  Missing data due to YSI 
maintenance (down time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by 
periods (.).  Edited and raw files are archived using a SUN Sparc II 
workstation. Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data. All 1996 
Thousand Acre and Oyster Landing files have been verified using Microsoft Excel 
5.0 macro programs which discover outliers (values which fall outside the range 
that the instrument is designed to measure - see section II.8 of this document) 
and other erroneous data.  Outliers were determined according to the 
instruments' manufacturers manual.  After macros were run, files with suspicious 
data were charted in Microsoft Excel to determine problems with probes.  The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) probe was most problematic.  In instances When the plot of 
DO increased in an exponential fashion and or (DO) also intermittently went 
outside the design specifications for that instrument and never returned to 
normal readings, the data were considered bad and removed from the data file.  
These macros are available on the NERRS CDMO home page. Paul Kenny, Chris 
Aadland and Rick Clutter edited and archived the 1996 data for Thousand Acre and 
Oyster Landing. 

3.  Research Objectives
Measurements were taken every 30 minutes over two week periods at he Oyster 
Landing and Thousand Acre stations. 

4.  Research methods (YSI dataloggers)
Prior to the YSI Datalogger deployment, a 4" diameter PVC pipe was strapped to a 
treated 2" X 6" board; this board was then nailed into a pier piling at the 
Thousand Acre and Oyster Landing site.Each YSI Datalogger is lowered into a PVC 
pipe which has two large windows cut out near the bottom for the probes to have 
direct contact with the water column.  A stop bolt placed through the PVC pipe 
below the cut out windows maintains the YSI Datalogger at each site exactly one 
foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  Every half hour over a two week period, 
measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, water temperature, pH, turbidity , and water level were recorded at each 
site.  Sampling intervals were selected due to biofouling of the dissolved 
oxygen membrane and expected battery life.  At the end of each sampling 
interval, the YSI Datalogger is brought back into the laboratory for 
downloading, cleaning and recalibration.  These procedures are carried out 
according to the methods as described in the YSI Operating Manual (see sections 
3 and 7).  After approximately 24 hours of down time for cleaning and overnight 
recalibration (if necessary), the YSI dataloggers are redeployed.  If necessary, 
a Hydrolab datalogger may be substituted for a YSI. All maintenance downtimes 
and membrane cleaning periods are recorded in a log book.


5.  Site location and character
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
southeastern coast of the United States on the Atlantic Ocean in two tidal 
estuaries, North Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The 
North Inlet estuary, located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-
built Class C type estuary (Pritchard, 1955)1.  The North Inlet estuary is 
composed of numerous winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal 
estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 
area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to 
the north.  The Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by 
Pritchard (1955)1, which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North 
Carolina, is one of the largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern 
Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the 
sub-basins of 6 major rivers which are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, 
and industry.  The rivers drain approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  
Descriptions of the two sampling stations are as follows:

1)  Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:18:22; long. 79:15:4) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek approximately 30 
meters northeast of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh.  The creek empties 
into the northeastern  side of the mid portion of Winyah Bay and directly drains 
pine forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 0 to 15 ppt.  
Georgetown, 5 km upstream from the Thousand Acre site and on the southern side 
of Winyah Bay, is the home port for a number of heavy industries including a 
steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a coal fired power plant.  A public 
sewage treatment plant is also located in Georgetown.

2) Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat  33:21:03; long.  79:11:24). The Oyster Landing 
monitoring site is located in the upper reaches of Crabhaul Creek in the mid 
western potion of North Inlet.

6.  Data collection period
Thousand Acre data collection began January 1, 1995, and Oyster Landing data 
collection began  on January 1st, 1995.
All sampling is ongoing.

7.  Associated researchers and projects
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  TA is our permanent monitoring station for the NERR 
National Monitoring Program.  This station is also included in our NIW core 
monitoring program.
