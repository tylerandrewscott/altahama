2. Entry verification
Deployment data are uploaded from the YSI data logger to a Personal 
Computer (IBM compatible).  Data plots are produced and examined and 
erroneous data are detected using the PC6000 or EcoWatch software from 
YSI.  Notes are made of any unusual data during that deployment.  Files 
are exported from EcoWatch in a comma-delimited format (.CSV) and 
opened in Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format 
macro that was developed by the CDMO to reformat the header columns, 
insert station codes, insert a corrected time column and allow the 
technician to remove any pre- and post-deployment data from the file.  
Where deployment overlap occurs between files, the data produced by the 
newly calibrated sonde is accepted as being the most accurate.  The 
pre-processed file is then ready to be copied into the EQWin water.eqi 
file where the data are QA/QC checked and archived in a database.  
EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data set 
outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is 
designed to measure) and large changes in the data.  EQWin is also used 
to generate statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and 
reports of the data, cross query the water, weather and nutrient data 
and finally export the data to the CDMO. Joy Austin has been 
responsible for data management since 1/2002.

3. Research objectives

Goodwin Islands (GI) component:
The Goodwin Islands represent marsh islands surrounded by intertidal 
flats, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, oyster reefs, and 
shallow open estuarine waters.  Because minimal human activities occur 
within upland portions, the Goodwin Islands are suitable as a reference 
or control site for non-point source water quality issues.  
Furthermore, due to extensive wetlands,intertidal, and submerged 
habitats, the Goodwin Islands are used extensively for SAV, material 
flux, fisheries science and trophic interaction research activities.  

Claybank (CB) component:
The Claybank site represents a shallow (<2m) littoral area 
approximately 300-400 meters in width and located within the mesohaline 
portion of the York River estuary. Prior to 1972, this area supported 
submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) but current conditions are not 
conducive to SAV survival.  This site is used extensively to study 
sediment dynamics and environmental stress on SAV.  

Taskinas Creek (TC) component:
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal 
plain, rural watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This 
watershed is dominated by forested and agricultural land uses with an 
increasing urban land use component.  The drainage basin is suited for 
investigating hydrologic and non-point source water quality issues 
associated with changing land use patterns.   

Sweet Hall Marsh (SH) component:
Sweet Hall Marsh is the most downriver extensive tidal freshwater marsh 
located in the Pamunkey River, one of two major tributaries of the York 
River.  Research activities are currently addressing the impacts of 
salinity intrusion due to relative sea level rise.  In addition, Sweet 
Hall Marsh has been used extensively to study general ecology and 
material flux within tidal freshwater marshes.


4. Research methods 

The following research methods apply for all stations.

A YSI 6600 EDS unvented datalogger was used to measure specific 
conductivity, pH, depth, percent dissolved oxygen saturation, 
temperature, and turbidity at 15-minute intervals throughout the 2004 
deployment year (see Section 6 for deployment intervals).  Salinity and 
dissolved oxygen concentration are calculated parameters.  Water depth 
data for 2004 have been post-corrected for atmospheric pressure changes 
that occurred between time of calibration and field retrieval.  
CBNERRVA maintains atmospheric pressure sensors at Gloucester Point, 
Taskinas Creek and Sweet Hall Marsh.  Atmospheric pressure information 
is collected at 15-minute intervals.  Calibration pressure information 
was provided by measurements made within the laboratory at Gloucester 
Point, VA.  At approximately one to two-week intervals, the datalogger 
was returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, membrane replacement 
and recalibration. Maintenance intervals vary from year to year and 
site-to-site depending on the amount of biofouling and expected battery 
life. In general, YSI dataloggers were deployed for two-week intervals 
from the beginning of December to the end of April and one-week 
intervals from the beginning of May to the end of November. A second 
YSI datalogger was deployed following retrieval of the original YSI 
datalogger in order to maintain a continuous record. 

Field verification samples for pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and 
temperature were taken during the deployment/retrieval procedure.  PH 
was measured in the lab with a Orion pH meter model 370 and the field 
pH was measured with a YSI 600 XLM sonde.  Dissolved oxygen was 
determined by Winkler titration and in the field with a LaMotte kit.  
Temperature and salinity were determined in the field by using the YSI 
600 XLM sonde and YSI 85 instrument.  All YSI procedures are in 
accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, Sections 3 and 7.  
Standards for pH were purchased from Fisher.  Standards for specific 
conductivity and Turbidity were purchased from YSI.  Data are reviewed 
and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in 
Appendix C of the CDMO manual version 5.1.
 
Goodwin Islands (GI) component:

The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality 
monitoring station at Goodwin Islands.  This station is located on the 
southeastern side of the main island in a shallow embayment, 
approximately 400 meters from shore.  The station was established in 
1997 and consisted of a stable structure composed of a 4 inch PVC pipe 
housed within a galvanized steel tower.  The lower portion of the PVC 
pipe was milled to allow for water circulation within the pipe and 
around the datalogger sensors.  The datalogger was suspended so that 
the sensors are maintained 0.5 m from the bottom substrate.  On July 
22, 2004 (12:15 EST), the station was moved approximately 25 meters 
southwest of the previous station in order to address sand shoaling and 
station maintenance issues.  Other than the datalogger being suspended 
0.25 m above the bottom substrate, the construction design of the new 
station is identical to the previous station.  The new station results 
in sensors being maintained at a similar depth below the water surface 
as compared to the previous station.  

Clay Bank (CB) component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality 
monitoring station at Clay Bank.  The station is located within a 
shallow (<2m) littoral area approximately 300-400 meters wide.  A 
stable structure that consists of a 6-inch PVC pipe attached to a 
piling, was built in January 2001.  The lower portion of the PVC pipe 
was milled to allow for water circulation within the pipe and around 
the datalogger sensors. The datalogger is suspended so that sensors are 
located 0.25 m from the bottom substrate.  On June 17, 2004 (13:15 EST) 
the station was moved approximately 100 meters offshore of the previous 
station in order to address sand shoaling and station maintenance 
issues.  The new structure is composed of a 4 inch PVC pipe, with the 
lower portion milled to allow for uninhibited water circulation, housed 
within a galvanized steel tower.  The datalogger is suspended 0.31 m 
above the bottom substrate.  The new station results in sensors being 
maintained 9 cm deeper as compared to the previous station.

Taskinas Creek (TC) component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality
monitoring station at Taskinas Creek.  The station is located near the 
mouth of Taskinas Creek where the tidal marsh creek converges with the 
York River estuary.  A simple deployment, consisting of a suspended 
wire attached to an overhanging tree, was established in September 
1995.  The datalogger was suspended at a fixed depth approximately 0.5 
m above the creek-bed.  In September 1997, the deployment was modified 
so that the datalogger remained secure and stable at all times within a 
4-inch PVC housing attached to a piling system. The lower portion of 
the PVC pipe was milled to allow for water circulation within the pipe 
and around the datalogger sensors.  The datalogger was suspended so 
that the sensors are maintained 0.5 m above the bottom substrate.

Sweet Hall Marsh (SH) component:
The Chesapeake Bay Virginia NERR maintains a long-term water quality 
station at Sweet Hall Marsh.  This station, established in 2000, is 
located adjacent to a low-use boathouse where a 6-inch PVC pipe is 
attached to an adjacent pier piling.  The datalogger was suspended so 
that the sensors remained 0.7 m from the bottom substrate.  In contrast 
to above stations, the Sweet Hall Marsh station is maintained on a two-
week deployment interval throughout the year.  


5.  Site location and character

(a) Goodwin Islands (Lat 37.21739; Long 76.3954)

The Goodwin Islands component of CBNERRVA is located on the southern 
side of the mouth of the York River. The station is located 
approximately 400 meters from shore, with and average water depth on 
the order of 1m. Goodwin Islands are a 315 ha (777 acre) archipelago of 
salt-marsh islands surrounded by inter-tidal flats and extensive beds 
of submerged aquatic vegetation (121 ha; 300 acres) dominated by 
eelgrass (Zostera marina) and Widgeon grass (Ruppia maritime). Water 
circulation patterns around the island are influenced by York River 
discharge and wind patterns of the Chesapeake Bay. Tides at the Goodwin 
Islands are semi-diurnal and display an average range of 0.7 m (range: 
0.4 - 1.1 m). Seasonal water quality conditions described here are from 
1998 through 2003 (Spring: March-May; Summer: June-August; Fall: 
September-November; Winter: December-February).  Mean seasonal water 
temperature ranged between 13.7-15.6 for spring, 25.7-27.2 for summer, 
18.0-19.2 for fall, and 4.7-8.2 °C in winter.  Mean seasonal salinity 
ranged between 13.9-23.0 for spring, 17.3-23.0 for summer, 20.4-24.0 
for fall, and 18.4-23.3 ppt in winter. The data logger probes are 
located 0.5 m above the sandy substrate bottom.  Potential activities 
that could impact the site included, light recreational and commercial 
boating activity.

(b) Claybank (Lat 37.34855; Long 76.61123)

The Claybank station is loaded within a shallow (<2m) littoral area 
approximately 300-400 meters wide along the mesohaline portion of the 
York River estuary.  The site is approximately 26 km upriver from the 
mouth of the estuary.  The shoreline consists of a narrow fringe of 
salt marsh with some areas armored with bulkhead or stone. Tidal range 
is on the order of 0.85 meters.  This station is located along the 
north shoreline of the estuary in an area that historically (prior to 
1972) supported submersed aquatic vegetation.  The sampling station is 
influenced by a secondary turbidity maximum that moves back 
and forth in a region of about 20-40 km from the mouth of the York 
River estuary.  Substrate within the region varies from fine sediments 
to sand.  The site is exposed to strong winds from the northwest and 
re-suspension of sediment during storm events can be high. There is no 
fresh water input at this site. Seasonal water quality conditions 
described here are from 2001 through 2003 (Spring: March-May; Summer: 
June-August; Fall: September-November; Winter: December-February).  
Mean seasonal water temperature ranged between 14.0-16.2 for spring, 
26.1-27.7 for summer, 17.5-19.4 for fall, and 4.9-8.0 °C in winter.  
Mean seasonal salinity ranged between 15.7-20.3 for spring, 16.5-21.3 
for summer, 13.2-21.6 for fall, and 14.3-20.0 ppt in winter.  

(c) Taskinas Creek (Lat 37.41497; Long 76.71441)

Taskinas Creek Reserve, component of CBNERRVA, encompasses 397 ha (980 
acres) and is located within the boundaries of York River State Park 
near the town of Croaker, Virginia.  The small sub-estuary of the York 
River is located on the southern side of the river, approximately 37 km 
up river from the mouth of the York River.  The Taskinas Creek 
watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain, rural watershed 
within the southern Chesapeake Bay system. The watershed is dominated 
by forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing residential 
land use component. The non-tidal portion of Taskinas Creek contains 
feeder streams that drain oak-hickory forests, maple-gum-ash swamps and 
freshwater marshes. Freshwater mixed wetlands are found in the upstream 
reaches of Taskinas Creek.  The creek is roughly 2 meters deep and 20 
meters wide towards the lower end of the creek where substrate is 
dominated by fine sediment.  Mean tide range is 0.85 m.  Seasonal water 
quality conditions described here are from 1998 through 2003 (Spring: 
March-May; Summer: June-August; Fall: September-November; Winter: 
December-February).  Mean seasonal water temperature ranged between 
15.2-19.0 for spring, 26.8-28.2 for summer, 17.6-18.3 for fall, and 
3.9-9.0 °C in winter.  Mean seasonal salinity ranged between 4.0-14.0 
for spring, 7.0-18.2 for summer, 6.9-17.0 for fall, and 8.4-15.3 ppt in 
winter. Potential activities that could impact the site include 
residential development, selective hardwood logging, and light 
recreational boating activity.  Wildlife populations have been shown to 
influence microbiological water quality within the watershed.


(d) Sweet Hall Marsh (Lat 37.57138; Long 76.88424)

Sweet Hall Marsh is the most downriver extensive tidal freshwater marsh 
located in the Pamunkey River, one of two major tributaries of the York 
River.  The marsh is located approximately 77 km upriver from the mouth 
of the York River estuary. The reserve is 353 ha (871 acres) in area 
and includes 331 ha (818 acres) of emergent fresh-water marsh, 14 ha 
(35 acres) of permanently flooded broad-leaved forested wetlands and 
approximately 4 ha (9 acres) of scrub-shrub. The marsh community is 
classified as freshwater mixed.  Mean tidal range at Sweet Hall Marsh 
is on the order of 0.9 m.  The Pamunkey River, which surrounds Sweet 
Hall Marsh, can reach depths up to 15 meters.  Substrate within the 
littoral zone and channel is dominated by fine sediment.  Seasonal 
water quality conditions described here are from 2002 through 2003 
(Spring: March-May; Summer: June-August; Fall: September-November; 
Winter: December-February).  Mean seasonal water temperature ranged 
between 14.7-16.7 for spring, 26.7-27.9 for summer, 19.1 (both years) 
for fall, and 4.7-6.3 °C in winter.  Mean seasonal salinity ranged 
between 0.1-3.4 for spring, 0.1-8.4 for summer, 0.4-8.4 for fall, and 
0.3-3.2 ppt in winter.  Potential activities that could impact the site 
include minor municipal point source discharges above and below river 
of Sweet Hall Marsh, a major industrial discharge site (pulp mill) in 
the town of West Point and significant groundwater withdrawal near the 
confluence of the Pamunkey and York Rivers.

6.  Data collection period
Sampling at Claybank (CB), Goodwin Islands (GI), Sweet Hall Marsh (SH), 
and Taskinas Creek (TC) began January 2004. Sampling was continuous 
through December 2004. Occasional time skips occurred at all sites due 
to low batteries, water leakage into the battery compartment, and for 
no apparent reason.

The reliability of the dissolved oxygen (DO) data after 96 hours post-
deployment for non-EDS (Extended Deployment System) data sondes may be 
problematic due to fouling which forms on the DO probe membrane during 
some deployments (Wenner et al. 2001).  Many reserves have upgraded to 
the YSI 6600 EDS data sondes, which increases DO accuracy and longevity 
by reducing the environmental effects of fouling.  The user is 
therefore advised to consult the metadata and to exercise caution when 
utilizing the DO data beyond the initial 96-hour time period.  However, 
this potential drift is not always problematic for some uses of the 
data, i.e. periodicity analysis.   It should also be noted that the 
amount of fouling is very site specific and that not all data are 
affected.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be 
contacted concerning the reliability of the DO data because of the site 
and seasonal variation in the fouling of the DO sensor. 

The NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program utilizes YSI data sondes that 
can be equipped with either depth or water level sensors. Both sensors 
measure water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to 
atmospherically vented measurements and depth refers to non-vented 
measurements. Standard calibration protocols for the non-vented sensor 
use the atmospheric pressure at the time of calibration. Therefore, 
changes in atmospheric pressure between calibrations appears as changes 
in water depth. The error is equal to approximately 1.03cm for every 1 
millibar change in atmospheric pressure. This error is eliminated for 
level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere throughout the 
deployment time interval. If proper atmospheric pressure data are 
available, non-vented sensor depth measurements can be corrected for 
deployments between calibrations. Water depth data for 2004 have been 
post-corrected for atmospheric pressure changes that occurred between 
time of calibration and field retrieval. Readings for both vented and 
non-vented are automatically compensated for water density changes due 
to variations in temperature and salinity.

11.  Data anomalies (suspect data)
 
Specific dates and time ranges of potentially influenced 
data are listed with each respective month.  Starting with January, 
data were extracted in accordance with Version 5.1 of the CDMO Manual.  
Significantly elevated single point spike turbidity values which 
occured between background values were considered to be a product of 
sensor interference.  Single point spike turbidity values greater than 
200 NTUs for Goodwin Island, SweetHall Marsh, and 300 NTUs for Claybank 
and Taskinas Creek were deleted. Values between 39-200 NTUs for Goodwin 
Island, 230-300 NTUs for Taskinas Creek, 105-300 NTUs for Claybank, 
179-200 NTUs for Sweet Hall Marsh were reported as suspect and 
retained.  These suspect values exceeded 3 standard deviation from mean 
values based on 2002 and 2003 site specific data; Goodwin Island: 2 
year mean = 6.0, 2 year STDEV = 11.4, 3 STDEV plus mean = 39.4; 
Claybank: 2 year mean = 17.9, 2 year STDEV = 29.0, 3 STDEV plus mean = 
105; Taskinas Creek: 2 year mean = 62.4 2 year STDEV = 55.7, 3 STDev 
plus mean = 229.5; Sweet Hall Landing: 2 year mean =  43.6, 2 year 
STDEV = 44.1, 3 STDEV plus mean = 178.2.

15. Other remarks

a) Negative depth values can be due to extremely low water conditions, 
low-pressure systems, or probes being out of the water.  In the event 
where probes were clearly out of the water, as verified by specific 
conductance values, data were deleted.  When specific conductance 
values did not indicate probe exposure, negative depth values were 
retained and data was marked as suspect. Significant negative depth 
values were observed at Sweet Hall Marsh during the months of January 
through March; data reflects tidal patterns and were retained. 

b) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or 
zero, it was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in 
the edited data file due to the formatting of Excel.  The technician 
edited none of these data points by hand nor did he/she delete any of 
them.

c) Latitudes and longitudes of the fixed monitoring stations reflect 
re-surveying of the sites conducted in 2004 using Trimble Real Time 
Kinenmatic (RTK) survey equipment.

d) Please note: Time skips can occur due to low batteries, water 
leakage into the battery compartment, and for no apparent reason.
