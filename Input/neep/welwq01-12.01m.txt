2).  Entry verification:

The data are directly downloaded in the YSI-PC6000 format (as a .dat file) and 
the Comma Delimited format (as a .csv file) from the dataloggers to a PC lap-
top.  The data are reviewed using the PC6000 software (Eco-Watch).  Graphs and 
basic statistics are then generated with the Eco-Watch program and the 
information is printed out for each data file.  These graphs are used to 
determine any obvious data outliers and sonde and/or probe malfunction.  All 
downloaded data files from the dataloggers (both raw unedited .dat and .csv 
files) are then transferred via disk to a Power Mac G3, where all files are 
reviewed and formatted for CDMO and stored.  Here the raw unedited .csv data 
files are imported into Microsoft Excel 98.  After a complete month of data has 
been recorded, each file is ready to review, which requires several steps.  The 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel Macintosh macros; and the newly developed Macintosh 
import.xls macro (by Michele Cordrey, Tijuana NERR-July 2001) are used for all 
data.  

The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically format column 
widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users and Mac users (see above) with 30-minute data to automatically 
create a monthly Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for 
missing data.  In addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to 
this macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point 
graphs on a monthly basis. 

A data file is created (from the merged raw unedited .csv data files) in Excel 
format with a full month of data.  The first step is to make sure that the 
parameter columns are in the correct order, specified by the NERR CDMO.  If any 
parameters are not collected due to probe failure or other causes, the cells 
with this missing data are filled in with periods (.) and documented and 
explained in the appropriate section of the metadata.  Secondly, missing dates 
and times are inserted in the data file where data were not collected due to 
maintenance, sonde failure, etc., and the cells with this missing data are 
filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in the appropriate 
section of the metadata.  The first NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is then run to 
determine if there are any missing dates and times; and if so these missing 
dates and times are inserted.  Next, the second NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is 
used to find and filter all data readings outside the sonde specification 
measuring range for each parameter.  Here the outlier data generated by the 
second macro are examined and determined as either explained or unexplained 
anomalies, as specified by NERR CDMO Operations Manual (Version 4.0).  All 
anomalous data (explained and unexplained) are documented and explained in the 
appropriate sections of the metadata.  The explained anomalous data are then 
removed from the data file and replaced by periods.  The unexplained anomalous 
data are investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, 
instrument diagnostics, and Eco-Watch printouts.  If these data are rejected 
from the file then these are removed and replaced by periods.  Lastly, the third 
and final NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macro is used to reformat all the columns in the 
data file to the correct number of significant digits.  After this last step, 
once the file has been completely formatted and edited as specified by NERR 
CDMO, the file is saved as a Tab delimited (.txt) text file and sent by FTP to 
the CDMO.  The metadata form is also submitted with the data file to the CDMO, 
sent also as a text file (text only with line breaks).  Jim Dochtermann and 
Scott Orringer are responsible for this task of entry verification with the 
analyses of suspect and anomalous data.  Michele Dionne supervises, proofs and 
answers questions with the evaluation of suspect and anomalous data.

The use of the newest (Version 3.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 
System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water Quality 
Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in December 2000 when they became 
available.



3).  Research objectives:

The Webhannet River estuary is located in proximity to heavily used 
beaches in Wells, Maine.  It has a shoreline that is highly developed with 
residential and commercial structures.  The estuary receives water from a 14 sq. 
mi. watershed that is well forested.  We are measuring variations in hydrologic 
variables in the Webhannet River estuary at the Head of Tide and at the Inlet.  
Data from Head of Tide will integrate surface and ground water inputs (from both 
point and non-point sources) from the freshwater watershed into the estuary.  
Data from the Inlet will integrate surface and ground water inputs from the 
freshwater watershed and the estuarine watershed.  Differences in data between 
the Head of Tide and the Inlet will indicate inputs from the estuarine portion 
of the watershed (on the ebb tide), and inputs from the Gulf of Maine on the 
flood tide.  The instruments will track runoff events via salinity, and will 
measure pollutant-carrying sediment particles via turbidity.  Our working 
hypothesis is that the freshwater watershed is the primary source of sediment 
and therefore potential NPS pollutants in the estuary.  These two variables will 
indicate the potential for non-point source pollutants to enter the estuary, and 
whether they are of upland, estuarine or Gulf of Maine origin.  Other variables 
measured by the data loggers (DO, temperature, pH, specific conductivity, and 
water level) will provide important baseline data to track changes in the 
estuary's physicochemical parameters over the long term.  These variables can be 
affected by changes in human water use, and by natural or human induced changes 
in inlet and river channel morphology, climate, and organic loadings.  The Inlet 
site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term 
monitoring site.  The Head of Tide site is relatively unimpacted, located just 
east of the Route One bridge, and is our roving site.


4).  Research Methods

The Wells NERR YSI monitoring program began in April 1995 at one site 
(Head of Tide site-HT) and May 1995 at a second site (Inlet site-IN) in the 
Webhannet River estuary.  The two data loggers are installed with bottom 
moorings, as described below.  Both data loggers have 1/4 inch black vector mesh 
placed on the outside (using rubber bands) of the sonde guard to prevent fouling 
and unwanted animals.  All deployment structures (PVC tubes) described below are 
labeled with the Wells NERR information.

*IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN); where our telemetry unit is 
stationed: A new vented level YSI 6600 with its new vented level cable was 
deployed to collect its first data on 5/4/99 at 12:00.  The YSI telemetry unit 
began collecting its first data on 3/16/98 at 10:30:00.  

The Inlet site (IN) deployment methods are different than the other site (HT), 
due to the installation of a YSI telemetry unit.  A 23 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube was installed against a dock piling.  Four steel flat bars 
with bolts were used to attach this 23 foot PVC tube against the dock piling.  
A 3 by 1.5 inch PVC transducer was glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to 
allow the sonde to sit exactly 1.0 meter (3.28  ft) off the bottom.  Several 
vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A PVC threaded cap 
screws in to the threaded top of the PVC tube, also for security.  A hole was 
created in the PVC cap to allow the sonde to hook up with the telemetry unit 
using the 50 foot cable.  The collection of data parameters at the Inlet (IN) 
site are slightly different then at the roving (HT) site, due to the telemetry 
unit installation.  Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen due 
to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane and probe 
fouling.  Battery power is not needed anymore within the sonde itself (although, 
battery power is needed during calibrations and downloading) at the time of 
deployment at this site because of the telemetry unit¹s solar batter power.  
Measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and turbidity are recorded at 30 minute 
intervals throughout the deployment period.  Time, date, and battery voltage are 
no longer programmed to be recorded by the sonde, since these parameters are 
already programmed with the Eco-Watch Program (see YSI¹s Eco-Watch Users Guide).

The other site, Head of Tide (HT), is deployed similarly, except for sonde 
height off the bottom (see below).  This site uses a 5 foot, 4 inch diameter 
high grade PVC tube.  The PVC tube is attached to a 12 foot, heavy steel sign 
post using a stainless steel bolt at the bottom of the tube, a stainless steel 
cable wrap at the top, and several thick electrical cable ties in between.  The 
steel sign post was pounded in about 6 feet into the river bottom, such that the 
bottom of the PVC tube was flat on the river bottom.  The PVC tube has one 3 by 
1.5 inch PVC transducer glued on the inside bottom of the PVC tube to allow the 
sonde to sit exactly at a certain height off the bottom (see below).  Several 
vertical holes, representative of the sonde guard, were cut out the 
circumference near the bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  
An "L" shaped steel bar with two end-holes is placed through two created slits 
about a half of foot from the top of the PVC tube.  A stainless steel wire 
(1/16") is attached to the sonde bail using two stainless steel clips; and to 
one end of the "L" shaped steel bar for sonde deployment and retrieval.  A 
marine lock is attached through the other end of the "L" shaped steel bar to 
hold the bar, wire, and sonde in place and for security.  A flotation buoy is 
tied to the PVC tubes incase the deployment structure ever gets dislodged.  The 
deployment depth for the Head of Tide site (HT) is such that the probe-end of 
the data logger is secured 0.30 meters (1.0 ft) off the bottom.	

Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen for the data sonde 
due to limitations created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane, probe 
fouling, and limited battery power.  Measurements of temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and 
turbidity are recorded at 30 minute intervals throughout the deployment period.
	
After the deployment period, the data logger is brought back into the 
Wells Reserve Laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and calibration.  These 
procedures are carried out to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.  
Calibration standards are needed and used for only specific conductivity (10 
mS/cm), pH (buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10), and turbidity (100 NTU).  
Conductivity and pH standards are purchased from Fisher Scientific.  Turbidity 
standards are purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc. (Redwood City, CA).  
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced and sit 6-24 hours before each 
deployment.  After approximately 6-24 hours of down time for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration, the YSI Data logger is redeployed for another 
sampling period.  Also, with our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the 
amount of time of missing data from calibrations and maintenance for this site.

Note:  The Wells NERR two Drakes Island sites (see 1996-1997 metatdata) are 
currently being monitored (since 1996), but we are using the data for another 
project (CICEET-Wells Harbor dredge; see Section 7-Associated Researchers and 
Projects); and are not collecting the dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, and 
pH parameters.

The use of the newest (Version 3.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) 
System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water Quality 
Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in December Œ00 when they became 
available.
	

5).  Site location and character    

The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York County, 
within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and faces the Atlantic 
Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 miles) south of Portland, 
Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, Massachusetts.  The Reserve 
encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of Maine coastline of tidally-flushed 
wetlands, riparian and transitional upland fields and forests within the Little 
River Estuary and the larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in 
the sandy glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers empty 
into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles along the 
Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river's inlet are double spit barrier beaches 
attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system is approximately 5 sq. km and 
is composed of large intertidal marshes (predominantly S. patens and S. 
alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed 
for the Webhannet River estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 
streams, brooks or creeks, which enter the estuary.  These tributaries flow 
across sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the impermeable 
sandy muds of the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The Webhannet 
River is connected to the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a spring tidal prism 
of 28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). The force and volume of tidal action affect 
the salinity level of both rivers.  In the Wells region, the annual mean wave 
height is almost 20 inches.  The estuarine system is dominated by semi-diurnal 
tides having a range of 8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into 
both estuaries is moderate to low (on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), 
especially in the summer, because of the rivers' relatively small drainage areas 
and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The relatively low flows from these 
two rivers taken in with the 20 inch per year average runoff of the area 
surrounding the estuaries combine to form a fresh water flow which is dwarfed by 
tidal flushing.  Twelve-foot tides dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet 
estuary, which has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet estuary, 
fed by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and greatly 
developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for comparison with the 
relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land use of the Webhannet estuary 
include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh water, and tidal marsh; a total of 
63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 18.6% for developed land (compared to a 
total of 5.7% development in the Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 
1997).
	
There are two sampling sites in the Webhannet River estuary.  These are 
located at the Head of Tide and at the Inlet.  The tidal range at each of these 
sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.   
	
The Head of Tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just 
downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 
deg 17' 54.25227" Latitude, 70 deg 35' 13.82728" Longitude).  Route One is used 
heavily with traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  
This site has soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide 
depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean 
of 3.6 ppt.  These head waters of the Webhannet are relatively undeveloped.  
This site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is our 
roving site.
	
The Inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the 
Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19' 12.44804" Latitude, 70 deg 33' 13.82728" 
Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an extensive wetland/salt 
marsh area which is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most 
recently dredged in 1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing 
and recreational boats.  The mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the 
Atlantic Ocean.  This channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a 
predominately sand substrate and is characterized by strong current during 
incoming and outgoing tides.  The maximum depth of the Inlet site is 3 meters. 
The salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean of 31 ppt.  The Inlet site is 
heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is 
our long-term monitoring site.


6).  Data collection period:
	
The Webhannet River Head of Tide (HT) site data collection was re-deployed 
(after being pulled in every December from 1995-2000) on March 21, 16:00 and 
pulled after December 27, 10:00 for the winter months to prevent ice damage.  
This site gets a large amount of ice coverage from December through late March.
	
The Webhannet River Inlet (IN) site data collection began May 29, 1995, 
13:00.  The IN datalogger is ongoing throughout the year and is considered our 
long-term monitoring site, as this site remains relatively ice-free.

8). Associated researchers and projects

WELLS NATIONAL ESTUARINE RESEARCH RESERVE RESEARCH AT THE RESERVE for 2000-2001:

The Research Program at the Wells NERR conducts and supports research, 
monitoring, workshops, and research/resource management planning of relevance at 
local, regional and national levels.  The overall aim of our work is to produce 
science-based information needed to sustain or restore Gulf of Maine coastal 
habitats and resources, especially those found in salt marsh estuaries and 
watersheds.  During 2000-2001 twenty-three different studies (involving 79 
scientists, students, and staff  from the Reserve, 26 academic institutions and 
19 resource management groups) focused on several related themes:1) the quality 
of water resources  in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds 2) land conservation 
strategies to protect coastal watersheds 3) factors controlling salt marsh 
accretion, erosion and plant community vigor 4) the value of salt 
marsh as habitat for fish, shellfish and birds,  and 5) restoration of salt 
marsh habitat degraded through human actions.

Estuarine Water Resource Quality

Water quality is monitored continuously at several stations with automated 
instruments as part of a NERRS systemwide monitoring program, as well as 
bimonthly at 15-20 stations through our WET volunteer monitoring program.  The 
WET program also monitors two important biological parameters: fecal coliform 
bacterial contamination (an indicator of human health risk) and phytoplankton 
productivity (an indicator of estuarine health).  These data have 1) allowed us 
to identify several bacterial "hot spots" that we will be working to eliminate, 
2) are used to identify and open areas safe for shellfishing, and 3) have 
uncovered a relation between tides and low dissolved oxygen (a stressful 
condition for marine life) that needs further study.  Our water quality work has 
contributed to the designation of several Priority Watersheds in coastal 
Southern Maine by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 

Coastal Conservation Strategies

The Coastal Mosaic Project is a new program developed in response to requests 
for support from the conservation community to increase the quantity, quality 
and ecological integrity of conserved lands in our region.  Research staff 
organize and facilitate meetings, workshops, and communications for 18 partner 
conservation groups.  A key element of the Project is the Conservation Resource 
Center, a Reserve staffed GIS facility with a growing database able to 
provide maps of property, natural features and other data needed to develop 
effective conservation goals and strategies.  The Project is nearing completion 
of conservation lands maps for 13 Southern Maine coastal towns, and is 
undertaking an initiative to develop coastal watershed conservation strategies 
for 12 coastal watersheds within these towns.  The Reserve has a particular 
interest in educating communities about the ecologic and economic benefits of 
land conservation, especially along estuarine and riverine shorelines.

Salt Marsh Habitats and Communities

Factors that control the dynamics and vigor of salt marsh plant communities and 
marsh peat formation consequently determine the ability of a salt marsh to 
persist in the face of sea level rise.  Through a combination of experimental 
manipulations and long term monitoring, a number of multi-year studies are 
currently producing data to answer questions concerning the sustainability of 
salt marsh habitats in this region.  These studies are looking at nutrient-plant 
relations, plant community responses to physical and hydrologic disturbance, and 
the relative contribution of short-term natural events (e.g. storms) and human 
activities (dredging, tidal restriction) on patterns of sediment accretion and 
erosion.  The Reserve¹s marshes and beaches are already among the best studied 
sites in the U.S. with regard to long term accretion and erosion (over thousands 
of years).

HABITAT VALUE FOR FISH, SHELLFISH AND BIRDS

The Reserve combines long-term monitoring with periodic surveys and short-term 
experiments to identify species and measure trends and changes in populations of 
fish, crustaceans, clams and birds.   We have 10 years of data on upland and 
shore birds with which to assess the status of resident and migratory avian 
populations, and 8 years of wading bird data that we use as a gross level 
indicator of salt marsh health, which appears to be stable.  Our periodic 
larval, juvenile and adult fish surveys have produced the best available data 
for fish utilization of salt marsh estuaries in the Gulf of Maine.  In the 
coming year we plan to develop a long-term monitoring program for finfish that 
will be coordinated with other sites within the Gulf of Maine and along the east 
coast.  Since 1994 we have been conducting surveys and field experiments to look 
at the survival and growth of hatchery seed, juvenile and adult softshell clam 
with regard to habitat characteristics and predation by the invasive green crab.

Salt Marsh Degradation and Restoration

 Salt marsh ecosystems in the Gulf of Maine have sustained themselves in the 
face of sea-level rise and other natural disturbances for nearly five thousand 
years.  Since colonial times large areas of salt marsh (up to half of the total 
area) have been lost through diking, draining and filling.  Today, the remaining 
marshland is fairly well protected from outright destruction, but during the 
past 100 years, and especially since the 1950¹s, salt marshes have been divided 
into fragments by roads, causeways, culverts and tide gates.  Most of these 
fragments have severly restricted tidal flow, leading to chronic habitat 
degradation and greatly reduced access for fish and other marine species.  Since 
1991, the Wells Reserve has been studying the impact of these restrictions on 
salt marsh functions and values, and the response of salt marshes to tidal 
restoration.  We have been working to promote an awareness of the damage being 
done and the benefits of salt marsh restoration throughout the Gulf of Maine.

Research Program Update:
In addition to the Reserve-sponsored projects outlined above, numerous visiting 
investigators will be involved in on-site research.  Topics include: the effects 
of land use, sea level, and climate on estuarine productivity; the relationship 
between soil nutrients and plant community patterns; the influence of soil 
salinity on plant community interactions; the effect of tidal restriction on 
marsh peat accretion; the comparative ecology of fringe marshes and back barrier 
marshes; habitat use by upland birds, and the ecology of lyme disease.

€ The Wells NERR Research Dept. completed the work on the following project:  
"Community-based plan to manage current and future threats from point and non-
source point pollution in the Merriland River and Branch Brook Watersheds of the 
Little River Estuary".  There was a shoreline survey of the Little River and its 
Watershed this past March.  The goal of this project was a)to produce a 
community-based watershed management plan for the Branch Brook, Merriland River, 
Little River combined watersheds, and b)to convey the elements of the plan to 
critical audiences through a succinct "road show", culminating in a public event 
to showcase the plan.  The project results are currently being written up.

€ The Wells NERR Research Dept. also completed the work on the following 
project: 
"Measuring the Health of the York River Ecosystem using Fish as Indicators".  
The results of this study have provide information on the ecology and fisheries 
of the York River that is essential for wise stewardship of this precious but 
threatened community resource.  The goal of this project was to assist the York

€The Wells NERR Research Dept. is involved with the following two CICEET* 
Projects-

I. Project Title: Estuarine Responses to Dredging: Analysis of Sedimentary and 
Morphological Change in Back Barrier Marsh to Aid Local Management and Develop a 
Regional Management Tool 
Principal Investigator (s): Michele Dionne, Wells NERR, 
ME; Duncan Fitzgerald, Boston University; Joe Kelley, University of Maine; David 
Burdick and Larry Ward, University of New Hampshire

Management Issue: Coastal management tool for assessing the impacts of dredging 
in estuaries 
Project Summary: An adequate supply of sediment is essential for 
maintaining salt marshes.  Human activities, such as channel dredging and tidal 
restriction due to road construction, can alter water flows in estuaries and 
result in dramatic changes in salt marsh sediment supply, affecting the speed of 
salt marsh erosion.  The objective of this project is to determine the impact of 
dredging and tidal restriction on salt marshes in the Wells NERR.  A digital 
coastal management guide will be created on CD ROM, providing coastal managers 
with useful conceptual models for predicting the impacts of dredging and other 
activities that affect water flow and sediment deposition in salt marshes.

II. Project Title: Application of a Continuous Imaging Flow Cytometer for 
Monitoring Estuarine Microplankton Principal Investigators: Mike Sieracki and 
Chris. Sieracki, Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Studies

Management Issue: New technology for detecting harmful algal blooms
Project Summary: Marine plankton is a significant component of highly productive 
estuaries, affecting the distribution of oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants.  
Estuarine marine plankton is also the primary food for the larvae of many 
commercially and ecologically important finfish and shellfish. In addition to 
their highly productive role, some species of plankton occasionally form 
nuisance or toxic blooms that affect human health as well as fish and shellfish. 
This project is developing an imaging system, called FlowCam, to continuously 
monitor plankton for the presence and abundance of harmful algal species.  The 
same technology could also be used to monitor the effects of harbor dredging on 
plankton.

€The Wells NERR Research Dept. is assisting with the maintenance and data 
collection of the FlowCAM instrument and FlowCAM computer.

January, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until March.

Inlet: 
a) There is missing dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 1/1 0:00 
through 1/29 9:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction; and a high DO charge on retrieval (a continuation from the 11/18/00 
2:00 probe crash (see Wells NERR 2000 Metadata). 
b) The following were two high positive turbidity spikes that were not 
consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, 
as we are not absolutely sure that these values were bad.
1/6 17:00 (1,064)-17:30 (1,379)

February, 2001 Sampling Period
a) Head of Tide: None to report; sonde not deployed until March.

Inlet: 
a) Small negative turbidity values were collected sporadically throughout the 
following time span: 2/19 11:00 to 2/23 0:00 (logging period recorded 91 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
b) The following was a high positive turbidity spike that was not consistent 
with the overall data record.  This suspect datum was not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that this value was bad.
2/6 23:00 (296.0)
c) The following were a range of high dissolved oxygen (12.4 to 19.2 mg/l; mean 
of 16.0 mg/l) and percent saturation (120.1 to 185.0 percent; mean of 152.0 
percent) spikes that were not consistent with the overall data record. These 
suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values 
are bad (the post calibration checked out normal).
2/6 16:00
2/10 11:30-12:30, 13:30-14:30
2/13 15:00-16:00

March, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) No data on 3/1 0:00 to 3/21 15:30; this was the first logger deployment (3/21 
at 16:00) at this site for 2001.
b) There was a sharp increasing and decreasing range of high positive turbidity 
spikes that occurred during the deployment, from 3/22 6:30 through 3/24 1:30 (82 
values with a range from 6.7 to 950.6 NTU; mean of 99.9 NTU); [not including the 
five values > 1000 NTU listed below]; that were not consistent with the overall 
data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure 
that these values are bad (the post calibration checked out normal).
3/23	4:00 (1035.6); 6:00 (1035.6); 8:00 (1035.6); 13:30 (1035.8); 21:00 
(1035.7)

Inlet: 
a) Small negative turbidity values were collected sporadically throughout the 
following time span: 3/29 03:30 to 3/30 6:30 (logging period recorded 52 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
b) The following were sporadic high positive turbidity spikes (>50 NTU) that 
were not consistent with the overall data record (range from 63.4 to 851.4 NTU, 
mean of 355.7 NTU).  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values were bad. This may have been due to the 
snowmelt accompanied by the astronomical high tides.
3/7 7:00-7:30, 20:30
3/23 0:30
3/24 11:00-11:30
3/25 17:00-17:30
c) The following are episodes of high dissolved oxygen (range from 12.5 to 38.3 
mg/l, mean of 16.7 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 120.0 to 351.1 
percent, mean of 157.8 percent) during several low tide and high tide 
fluctuations that were not consistent with the overall data record (at high tide 
the readings returned to the consistency of the overall data record).  These 
suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values 
are bad.  Other parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration 
were good. This may have been due to the snowmelt accompanied by the 
astronomical high tides.
3/23 13:30-14:30, 18:00-18:30, 20:00-23:30
3/24 0:00-2:00, 8:30-17:30
3/25 8:30-17:30
3/26 9:30-11:00, 12:30-17:30
3/27 8:30-18:00
3/28 11:30-18:00
3/29 13:30-18:00
d) No data from 3/14 11:30 to 3/16 14:30; needed to use sonde for a separate 
project (and re-deployed when finished (without recalibration)).

April, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: 
a) There was a continuous range of high positive turbidity spikes that occurred 
after an initial high spike of 16.7 NTU on 4/12 19:00, from 4/12 19:00 through 
4/30 23:30 (873 values with a range from 7.9 to 580.3 NTU; mean of 79.4) that 
were not consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect data were not 
deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad (the post 
calibration checked out normal).  (Although this value range would not normally 
be labeled anomalous as they are not considerably high spikes, they are 
included in this range because of continuously stabilized values after the 
initial high spike on 4/12 19:00).  This may have been due to the snowmelt.
b) No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data during the time span of 
4/13 1:30 through 4/30 23:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and 
probe malfunction. 
c) No data collected on 4/5 19:00 and 4/17 12:00 due to a data gap.  Logger did 
not record data.

Inlet:
a) Small negative turbidity values were collected sporadically throughout the 
following time span: 4/14 05:30 to 4/30 23:30 (logging period recorded 527 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
b) The following were eight sporadic high positive turbidity spikes that were 
not consistent with the overall data record (range from 168.5 to 854.8 NTU, mean 
of 482.5 NTU).  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely 
sure that these values were bad. This may have been due to the snowmelt 
accompanied by the astronomical high tides.
4/1 7:00-7:30, 18:00-18:30
4/3 17:00-17:30
4/14 1:00-1:30
d) The following are episodes of high dissolved oxygen (range from 11.7 to 27.5 
mg/l, mean of 15.2 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 120.6 to 268.3 
percent, mean of 147.0 percent) during several low tide and high tide 
fluctuations that were not consistent with the overall data record (at high tide 
the readings returned to the consistency of the overall data record).  These 
suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values 
are bad.  Other parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration 
were good. This may have been due to the snowmelt accompanied by the 
astronomical high tides.

May, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data during the time span of 
5/1 0:00 through 5/8 12:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and 
probe malfunction.  This is a continuation from April 2001 (see above). 
There was a continuous range of high positive turbidity spikes that occurred 
from 5/1 0:00 through 5/8 12:30 (a continuation from the initial high spike on 
4/12 19:00-see above), (364 values with a range from 32.7 to 75.4 NTU; mean of 
47.9) that were not consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect 
data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad 
(the post calibration checked out normal).  (Although this value range would not 
normally be labeled anomalous as they are not considerably high spikes, they 
are included in this range because of continuously stabilized values 
after the initial high spike on 4/12 19:00).  This may have been due to the 
snowmelt.
b) The following were high positive turbidity spikes that were not consistent 
with the overall data record.  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values were bad.
5/27 1:30 (56.3); 3:30 (29.7); 14:00 (74.6)

Inlet:
a) Small negative turbidity values were collected sporadically throughout the 
following time span: 5/1 1:30 to 5/7 12:30 (logging period recorded 231 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
b) The following was a high positive turbidity spike that was not consistent 
with the overall data record.  This suspect datum was not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that this value was bad.
5/14 9:00 (93.4)

June, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) The following were high negative turbidity spikes that occurred that were not 
consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, 
as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad (the post calibration 
checked out normal).
6/03 18:00 (-72.2)
6/06 21:00 (-5.4); 21:30 (-111.8)
6/17 16:30 (-80.5)
b) The following were high negative turbidity spikes that occurred that were not 
consistent with the overall data record. These data were deleted due to animal 
in probe compartment.
6/17 19:00 (-743.7); 20:30 (-863.9); 21:00 (-103.8)
c) Small negative and/or zero turbidity values were collected sporadically 
throughout the following time span: 6/26 11:00-6/28 11:00 (logging period 
recorded 30 anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data 
were not deleted.
d) The following are episodes of low dissolved oxygen (range from 0.4 to 2.8 
mg/l, mean of 1.1 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 3.9 to 30.5%, mean of 
12.6%) during several low tide and high tide fluctuations that were not 
consistent with the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to 
the consistency of the overall data record).  These suspect data were
deleted from 6/19 16:30-6/21 0830.

Inlet:
a)No data from 6/23 9:30 through 6/30 23:30 due to a major data sonde crash.  
All data was erroneous, and the logged dates were erratic.  The pre-deployment 
calibration was accepted, and the raw data file consisted of the following dates 
(only) with erroneous data:
6/27/01, 10/6/91, 6/28/01, 6/28/01, 6/28/01, 6/29/01, 6/29/01, 7/16/01, 7/16/01,

July, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide: 
a) The following are episodes of low and high dissolved oxygen (low-range from 
1.0 to 3.3 mg/l, mean of 2.5 mg/l; high-range from 7.7 to 13.8 mg/l, mean of 
10.4 mg/l) and percent saturation (low-range from 11.6 to 36.9%, mean of 28.1%; 
high-range from 110.7 to 166.3%, mean of 131.8%) during several low tide and 
high tide fluctuations that were not consistent with the overall data record (at 
normal tides the readings returned to the consistency of the overall data 
record).  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure 
that these values are bad.  Other parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, 
and recalibration were good.  These fluctuations were consistent with extremely 
high and low tide events, with high and low specific conductivity and salinity 
readings.
Low readings:
7/7 4:00
7/8 5:00-6:00
7/9 5:30-6:30
7/21 4:00-4:30

7/27 17:30-20:00
7/28 18:30-21:30
7/29 19:30-22:00
7/30 20:30-22:00
b) The following were three high positive turbidity spikes that were not 
consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, 
as we are not absolutely sure that these values were bad.
7/7 13:00 (201.9)
7/10 19:00 (284.0); 19:30 (58.7)
c) The following are shallow positive depth data (160 values with a range of 
0.00 to 0.09 m; mean of 0.06 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as 
other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted.  These 
fluctuations were consistent with extremely high and low tide events, with high 
and low specific conductivity and salinity readings.

7/26 0:00-2:30, 7:00-9:30

Inlet:
a) No data from 7/1 0:00 through 7/31 23:30 due to a major data sonde crash 
(continued from the 6/23 9:30 crash-see above).  All data was erroneous, and the 
logged dates were erratic.  The pre-deployment calibration was accepted, and the 
data file consisted of the following dates (only) with erroneous data:
6/27/01, 10/6/91, 6/28/01, 6/28/01, 6/28/01, 6/29/01, 6/29/01, 7/16/01, 7/16/01,

mg/l, mean of 2.6 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 15.6 to 36.3%, mean 
of 28.9%) during several low tide and high tide fluctuations that were not 
consistent with the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to 
the consistency of the overall data record).  These suspect data were not 
deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.  Other 
parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.  These

mg/l, mean of 11.5 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 135.0 to 160.3%, 
mean of 144.9%) during several low tide and high tide fluctuations that were not 
consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect data were not deleted, 
as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.  Other parameters, the 
dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.  These fluctuations were 
consistent with extremely high and low tide events, with high and low specific 
conductivity and salinity readings.

8/27	18:30-19:00
8/28	19:30-20:00

Inlet:
a) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 8/3 16:30 to 8/31 13:30 (logging period recorded 847 anomalies), possibly 
due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
The following were 7 high positive turbidity spikes (>50 NTU) that were not 
consistent with the overall data record (range from 52.1-70.4 NTU, mean of 60.2 
NTU).  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that 
these values were bad.

8/23 9:00
8/25 23:00
8/30 20:30
b) There is missing specific conductivity and salinity readings from 8/23 15:00 
through 8/31 23:30 due to a catastrophic probe failure.  Normally observed 
values decreased quickly to negative values, which was consistent with a post-
calibration failure.  Since a YSI 6600 was being used at this site, all other 
data were not deleted (separate probes; depth values checked out normal).
c) No data from 8/1 0:00 to 8/3 15:00; due to the major data sonde crash 
(continued from the 6/23 9:30 crash-see above), and due to downtime for 
calibration, maintenance and downloading.

September, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 9/9 7:30 to 9/30 22:30 (logging period recorded 260 anomalies), possibly 
due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
b) The following are shallow negative depth data (20 values with a range of 
­0.09 to ­0.01 m; mean of -0.06 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as 
other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted
9/1 1:00-10:00
9/4 15:30
c) The following are shallow positive depth data (177 values with a range of 
0.01 to 0.09 m; mean of 0.06 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as 
other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted

d) The following are episodes of low dissolved oxygen (range from 1.7 to 3.1 
mg/l, mean of 2.67 mg/l) and percent saturation (range from 19.3 to 37.8%, mean 
of 32.76%) during several low tide fluctuations that were not consistent with 
the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to the consistency 
of the overall data record).  These suspect data were not deleted, as we are not 
absolutely sure that these values are bad.  Other parameters, the dissolved 
oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good. These fluctuations were consistent 
with high and low specific conductivity and salinity readings.

9/30 3:00-4:30

Inlet: 
a) There is missing specific conductivity and salinity readings from 9/1 0:00 
through 9/13 8:30 due to a catastrophic probe failure (a continuation of the 
8/23 15:00 probe crash-see above).  Since a YSI 6600 was being used at this 
site, all other data were not deleted (separate probes; depth values checked out 
normal).
b) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 9/1 0:30 and 9/28 08:00-09:00 (logging period recorded 16 anomalies), 
possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
c) No turbidity data from 9/5 3:00 to 9/13 8:30 due to a turbidity probe 
malfunction.  Turbidity values began to fluctuate inconsistently, ranging from 
­6.5 to 1940 NTU.  This was also consistent with a post-calibration failure.
There is missing dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 9/18 17:00 
through 9/30 23:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction.  This may have been a result of using sonde for the other NOAA 
project (see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes).
d) There is missing data from 9/17 9:30 to 9/18 16:30; logger was needed for 
another NOAA project (see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes).
e) There is missing dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 9/18 17:00 
through 9/30 23:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction.  This may have been a result of using sonde for the other NOAA 
project (see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes).


October, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 10/1 10:00 to 10/31 23:30 (logging period recorded 626 anomalies), 
possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
b) The following are shallow negative depth data (5 values, all ­0.01 m).  Sonde 
probes suspected to be underwater as other parameters check out normal.  These 
data were not deleted.
10/25	14:30-16:30
c) The following are shallow positive depth data (159 values with a range of 
0.01 to 0.09 m; mean of 0.06 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as 
other parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted

10/27	0:00-7:30, 15:00
d) The following are episodes of low dissolved oxygen and percent saturation 
during several low tide and high tide fluctuations that were not consistent with 
the overall data record (at high tide the readings returned to 
the consistency of the overall data record).  These suspect data were not 
deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values are bad.  Other 
parameters, the dissolved oxygen post-cal, and recalibration were good.
10/16 09:00
10/20 19:00
e) The following deployment recorded negative turbidity data due to small 
calibration error. All turbidity data were deleted for the following deployment. 
10/19 11:00 - 11/16 14:30

Inlet: 
a) There is missing dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 10/1 0:00 
to 10/17 13:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction (This is a continuation from the 9/18 17:00 through 9/30 23:30 probe 
malfunction-see above).  This may have been a result of using sonde for 
the other NOAA project (see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes).
b) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 10/2 21:00 to 10/31 23:00 (logging period recorded 513 anomalies), 
possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
c) The following were high positive turbidity spikes (>50 NTU), that were not 
consistent with the overall data record (range from 54.8-145.7 NTU, mean of 83.4 
NTU).  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that 
these values were bad.

10/13	18:30
10/15	6:00, 16:00, 21:00
10/25	20:00
d) The following were high negative turbidity spikes that occurred that were not 
consistent with the overall data record. These data were deleted due to animal 
in probe compartment.
10/5 1:00 (-803.3), 1:30 (-907.1)
10/13	19:00	(-862.5)
e) There is missing specific conductivity and salinity readings from 10/17 15:30 
through 10/31 23:30 due to a catastrophic probe failure.  Although all the data 
values within this deleted period were not anomalous (outside the probe¹s range 
of measurement -- 56 values, sporadically throughout 10/17 22:30 to 10/31 
13:00; range of ­35.9 to ­0.01 mS/cm, mean of ­10.86 mS/cm), it was decided to 
delete all the data within this time range due to suspected probe failure. From 
observing the graph of this time span; it could not be believed that these data 
values were real.  Since a YSI 6600 was being used at this site, all other data 
were not deleted (separate probes).  
f) There is missing depth data from 10/17 15:30 through 10/31 23:30 due to a 
suspected vented-level depth failure.  Although all the data values within this 
deleted period were not anomalous (outside the probe's range of measurement ­ 
127 values, sporadically throughout 10/18 13:30 to 10/28 22:00; range of ­2.79 
to 17.72 m, mean of 0.94 m), it was decided to delete all the data within this 
time range due to suspected parameter failure.  From observing the graph of this 
time span; it could not be believed that these data values were real.

November, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 11/1 0:00 to 11/29 9:00 (logging period recorded 1,035 anomalies), 
possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
b) The following are shallow positive depth data (57 values with a range of 0.0 
to 0.09 m; mean of 0.06 m).  Sonde probes suspected to be underwater as other 
parameters check out normal.  These data were not deleted:
11/10	23:30
11/11	0:00-5:00
11/19	17:00-23:30
11/20	0:00-1:30, 3:30-13:00, 16:30-19:30
c) There is missing dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 11/20 
20:30 to 11/30 23:30 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction.  Although post-calibration results were normal, readings increased 
from 13.4 mg/l and 106.5 percent to a constant 17.6 mg/l and 136.5 percent.
d) There are no missing data due to downtime for calibration, maintenance and 
downloading.  However, there was an overlap with a 1-hour time span.  Previous 
deployed sonde was pulled after its 14:30 data log (11/16 14:30), and newly 
deployed sonde took its first true reading at (11/16) 14:00.  We decided to use 
the previous sonde up to 14:30, and the newly deployed sonde at 15:00.


Inlet:
a) There is missing specific conductivity and salinity readings from 11/1 0:00 
through 11/15 13:00 (a continuation from 10/17 15:30 through 10/31 23:30-see 
above) due to a catastrophic probe failure.  Although all the data values within 
this deleted period were not anomalous (outside the probe¹s range of measurement 
-- 14 values, sporadically throughout 11/1 23:00 to 11/14 7:00; range of ­26.0 
to ­0.67 mS/cm, mean of ­8.92 mS/cm), it was decided to delete all the data 
within this time range due to suspected probe failure. From observing the graph 
of this time span; it could not be believed that these data values were real.  
Since a YSI 6600 was being used at this site, all other data were not deleted 
(separate probes).  
b) There is missing depth data from 11/1 0:00 through 11/15 13:00 (a 
continuation from 10/17 15:30 through 10/31 23:30-see above) due to a suspected 
vented-level depth failure.  Although all the data values within this deleted 
period were not anomalous (outside the probe¹s range of measurement ­ 7 values, 
sporadically throughout 11/2 18:00 to 11/11 15:00; range of ­0.241 to ­0.024 m, 
mean of ­0.128 m), it was decided to delete all the data within this time range 
due to suspected parameter failure.  From observing the graph of this time span; 
it could not be believed that these data values were real.
c) Small negative turbidity values were recorded sporadically throughout the 
following time span: 11/1 0:30 to 11/30 06:00 (logging period recorded 249 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
d) The following were 73(almost continuous) high positive "rollover" turbidity 
spikes (>1000 NTU), that were not consistent with the overall data record (range 
from 1000.2 to 2031.0 NTU), mean of 1497.5 NTU.  This suspect data were not 
deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values were bad (post-
calibration checked out normal).

f) No data collected on the following dates/times; due to a data gap.  Logger 
either (1) did not record data within this time range, possibly due to an 
overwrite of data; or (2) did record the same data values because of an 
overwrite (these data were deleted).

December, 2001 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
a) There is missing dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 12/1 0:00 
to 12/11 14:00 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture or tear and probe 
malfunction.  Although post-calibration results were normal, readings increased 
from 13.4 mg/l and 106.5 percent to a constant 17.6 mg/l and 136.5 percent.  
(This is a continuation from November 2001; where values increased in the 
December part of the deployment to an increased constant of 19.65 mg/l and 143.1 
percent).
b) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 12/2 4:00 to 12/27 9:30 (logging period recorded 1,088 anomalies), 
possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
c) The following was a range of low negative dissolved oxygen and percent 
saturation data.  These suspect data were deleted (although the post calibration 
checked out normal), as these readings were out of the probe's acceptable range. 
12/12	12:00-14:30
12/13	13:00-14:00
These readings led to a decision to delete all dissolved oxygen and percent 
saturation data within this time span, from 12/11 14:30 to 12/27 9:30 a probe 
malfunction.
d) There is missing pH data from 12/11 14:30 to 12/27 9:30 due to a probe 
malfunction prior to sonde deployment-we were unable to calibrate the probe.
e) No data from 12/27 10:00 to 12/31 23:30. This datalogger was pulled for the 
year (winter months) to prevent ice damage.

Inlet:
a) Small negative turbidity values were recorded throughout the following time 
span: 12/1 18:30 to 12/31 22:00 (logging period recorded 55 anomalies), possibly 
due to a small calibration error.  These data were not deleted.
b) The following were 14 high positive "rollover" turbidity spikes (>1000 NTU), 
that were not consistent with the overall data record (range from 1121.2 to 
1740.8 NTU), mean of 1344.1 NTU.  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are 
not absolutely sure that these values were bad (post-calibration checked 
out normal).

c) The following were 42 (almost continuous) high positive turbidity spikes (>50 
NTU), that were not consistent with the overall data record (range from 50.4 to 
917.6 NTU), mean of 239.9 NTU.  This suspect data were not deleted, as we are 
not absolutely sure that these values were bad (post-calibration checked out 
normal).

d) The following were three high positive percent saturation and dissolved 
oxygen spikes that were not consistent with the overall data record.  These 
suspect data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values 
were bad.
12/24	16:00	(166.7, 16.6)
12/27	5:00 (145.5, 14.7)
12/28	22:30	(143.0, 14.4)
e) The following DO (% and mg/L) data were deleted due to a torn membrane toward 
end of deployment.
12/19 14:00 - 12/21 11:00


12).  Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14).  Other Remarks/Notes:

A) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): where our telemetry unit is 
stationed: A new vented level YSI 6600 with its new vented level cable was 
deployed to collect its first data on 5/4/99 at 12:00.  The YSI telemetry unit 
began collecting its first data on 3/16/98 at 10:30:00 (see Section 4-Research 
Methods).  

B) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): No data collected from 9/17 
9:30 through 9/18 16:30, as the logger was used for another NOAA project.  The 
logger was calibrated on 9/13 for its 9/14 10:00 deployment; deployed until 9/17 
9:00, removed for the NOAA project, and then replaced without re-calibration 
for 9/18 17:00 through 10/17 13:30 deployment.

C) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): For all data collected from 
9/14 10:00 through 10/17 13:30, a non-vented YSI 6000 was used.

D) IMPORTANT CHANGES TO NOTE AT THE INLET SITE (IN): After the telemetry unit 
was finally fixed in October 2001, the first telemetry deployment of 2001 began 
on 10/17 15:00.  Note:  All of 2001 did use the vented-level cable for the 
accurate depth (and the solar panel did power the sonde), but we were unable to 
download telemetry-the 
YSI 1240 radio boxes were sent back for repairs.

Note:  The Wells NERR two Drakes Island sites (see 1996-1997 metatdata) are 
currently being monitored (since 1996), but we are using the data for another 
project (CICEET-Wells Harbor dredge; see Section 7-Associated Researchers and 
Projects); and are not collecting the dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, and 
pH parameters.

E) The use of the newest (Version 3.0) National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(NERR) System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP) YSI 6-Series Multi-Parameter Water 
Quality Monitor Standard Operating Procedures began in December Œ00 when they 
became available.

F) With our extra data sonde, we have been reducing the amount of time of 
missing data from calibrations and maintenance for all sites.  Some months have 
no missing data from the use of this extra sonde.

G) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
