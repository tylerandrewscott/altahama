2.  Entry Verification:
	The data are uploaded directly from the YSI model 6000upg dataloggers to 
the YSI PC6000 software into a file appended with the suffix .dat. The data are 
also downloaded directly from the datalogger into a spreadsheet importable file 
appended with the suffix .csv.  The data are then reviewed for major problems 
(i.e. logger out of water, probe malfunction, battery failure etc.) using the 
YSI PC6000 plotting software.  The resulting plot is printed out and saved in a 
folder named "datalogger deployment log".  The .csv file is imported 
into Excel 5.0 for Macintosh and is edited and formatted.
	The tails of each sampling period are deleted and any suspect data is 
identified with the aid of Excel CDMO 5.0 macros and are evaluated and dealt 
with according to CDMO Operations Manual (ver.3.0) guidelines.  The parameter 
columns are checked for proper order and formatted to the correct decimal places 
using the "column reformat" macro supplied by the CDMO.  Missing data fields are 
inserted into the Excel spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Reasons for 
any missing or anomalous data are entered directly into the data file and the 
edited file is saved as a two-week excel file.  When an entire month of 
two-week edited data files have been collected, the files are combined into a 1 
month excel file.   Any dates and times when data was not collected are inserted 
and the reason for the missing data (from the deployment log) are entered 
directly into the excel file along with the editing information from the two 
week files.  All editing and missing data documentation are also recorded in an 
excel file named "missing data log".  The information in the "missing data log" 
is transferred to the metadata form. The edited and raw files are archived on a 
Sun Sparc 20 workstation and backed up to tape weekly.  Data and metadata files 
are uploaded via ftp to the CDMO. The person responsible for the data management 
is Michelle Cordrey. 

3.  Research Objectives:
	The Tijuana Estuarine Research Reserve is impacted heavily by both 
periodic raw sewage outflows and urban development. Only about a quarter of the 
reserve's 2,531 acres are tidally influenced with few channels deep enough for 
deployment of dataloggers.   

Initially two stations were set up; the "treatment" station was set up close to 
the mouth on the Southern end of the Oneonta Slough.  It was thought that this 
location would be best suited for monitoring changes caused by sewage outflow 
events.   The "control" station was set up on the northern end of Oneonta 
Slough.  Deployment at the treatment station, however, was continually halted by 
both shifting sediment and massive wracks of Kelp (macrocystis pyrifera) which 
would often bury the deployment set-up on incoming tides.  After a number of 
different deployment equipment designs were implemented, with no success, 
logging at this site was terminated.  Recently, however, a new channel was 
dredged in the northeast section of the estuary to increase tidal flushing.  
This restoration site named the "Tidal Linkage" will be the new location of the 
"treatment" site.  Comparisons will be made with the natural site as the 
hydrology of the constructed treatment site changes over time.

4.  Research Methods (Dataloggers)
	A 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was strapped to a 6 ft length of steel fencing 
post and driven into the sediment until refusal prior to datalogger deployment 
in the center of the channel.  The bottom of the pipe is raised 1' off of the 
channel bottom and is capped. Multiple 1.5" holes have been drilled in the 
bottom  cap and sides to permit unrestricted flow to the sensors.  The 
datalogger units are then placed into and rest on the bottom of the tubes during 
deployment.  The sampling period is two weeks with measurements being taken 
every 30 minutes.  Measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved 
oxygen (percent saturation), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), temperature, turbidity and 
water level are recorded.  At the end of each two week period, the YSI data 
logger unit  is replaced by another YSI datalogger unit and brought back to the 
laboratory for downloading, cleaning and recalibration. These procedures are 
carried out according to the methods described in the YSI Operations Manual 
version 3.0(see sections 3 and 7). Calibration standards for Specific 
Conductivity, pH and turbidity are purchased pre-made from VWR scientific.  The 
QA/QC procedures for the collected data are followed as given in the CDMO 
Operations Manual version 3.0. 
	In May 1997 sampling at the "Tidal Linkage" station began.  All 
deployment, calibration and QA/QC procedures were followed exactly as they are 
at the Oneonta Slough station. 
	Additionally, starting on May 23, 1997 plastic mesh sleeves were placed on 
sondes at both stations to inhibit crabs from interfering with the sensors.

5.  Site location and character
General site Characteristics (TJE)
a) Tidal exchange (extremes): approx. -2 +7 MLLW,
b) Salinity: 4 ppt (extreme rain events) to 38 ppt
c) Potential impacts: storm drain runoff from military airfield and adjacent 
residential areas, occasional sewage spills (10-15 MGD) into the Tijuana River 
from Mexico.  The area surrounding the estuary is heavily developed by 
residential housing as is the watershed which drains into the estuary.  
Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico.  The North Eastern section of 
the reserve is bordered by a military helicopter training base.  Vegetation 
in the area is dominated by common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) and Pacific 
cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).  

Specific Site characteristics: Oneonta Slough
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger is located on the upper portion of Oneonta 
Slough.  The channel runs North to South and is located on the northwestern edge 
of the reserve. Latitude is 32 deg  34 min 04.8 sec N, longitude is 117 deg 07 
min 52.3 sec W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom directly below the datalogger is approx. 
0.55m below Mean Sea Level.
c) Channel width is approx. 20 meters.  Datalogger site is located 1km from 
mouthd) Bottom type: sand and sediment
e) Area adjacent to west side of channel is developed. There is a 50 meter 
buffer of natural vegetation between development and the channel.  Area adjacent 
to east side of channel is relatively natural.
f) Direct impacts are estimated to be runoff from streets into channel during 
rain events.

Specific Site Characteristics: The Tidal Linkage
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger is located in the middle of the constructed 
channel known as the Tidal Linkage.  The channel runs Northwest to Southwest and 
is located adjacent to the visitor's center in the northeastern section of the 
reserve. Latitude is 32 deg 34 min 24.9 sec N, longitude is117 deg 07 min 32.2 
sec N.  In November of 1999 the datalogger site was moved approximately 180 
meters northwest to a deeper section of the same channel.  The latitude of 
the new site is 32 deg 34 min 27.9 sec N, the longitude is 117 deg 07 min 37.8 
sec W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom at the site prior to November 1999 is 
approximately 0.9m below Mean Sea Level. The depth at the new site has not yet 
been surveyed.
c) Channel width:  Approximately 5 meters at both the old and new sites
d) Bottom type: mostly mud at both old and new sites.
e) Direct impacts: none that are specific to the Tidal Linkage and not to the 
estuary as a whole. i.e.  urban development, high periodic sewage inputs from 
Mexico, etc.

7.  Associated researchers and projects
Sharook Madon (PERL) is using temperature data from the dataloggers in a model 
to evaluate the value of marsh surface access in killi fish growth.  Greg 
Williams and Janelle West (PERL) are looking at shifts in fish and invertebrate 
assembleges associated with the 1997 - 1998 el nino event. The Tidal Linkage 
channel is the ongoing site of research being conducted by PERL which focuses on 
methods for increasing the success of saltmarsh revegetation projects.
