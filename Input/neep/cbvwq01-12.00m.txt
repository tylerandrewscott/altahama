2. Entry verification
The data were uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 data loggers and reviewed 
using PC6000 software from YSI.  Graphs were produced and examined using the 
PC6000 software then printed out and filed in order to aid in reviewing data to 
correlate any anomalous and outlying data.  Next, files were uploaded in comma-
delimited format, which were opened in Excel 5.0 software and edited to remove 
extraneous information (headers, footers, spaces, and pre- and post-deployment 
data).  Monthly templates were used to form complete sets of monthly data sets. 
Macros supplied by NERRS/CDMO were used to help with editing, formatting and 
identifying outliers in the database.  Suspect data (as in data believed to 
result from a damaged or biofouled probe) were evaluated according to Appendix B 
of the CDMO manual, edited and documented. Missing data due to YSI maintenance 
(downtime) was inserted into the spreadsheet and was denoted by periods (.).  
Data that was not within calibration range of the instrument were evaluated and 
removed from the record and denoted by periods (.).  Edited and raw data files 
were copied and archived in the CBNERRVA file server and uploaded to the CDMO 
FTP site.  All Taskinas Creek and Goodwin Islands files from 2000 have been 
verified using the latest update of the CDMO Microsoft Excel 5.0 macro programs, 
which identified outliers (values that fall outside of the calibration - see 
section II.8 of this document) and other erroneous data.  Outliers were 
determined according to the instruments' manufacturers manual.  Janet Nestlerode 
collected 2000 Goodwin Island data from 01/00 to 12/00.  Robert Carrol collected 
the 2000 Taskinas Creek data.  Eric Wooden processed the 2000 data from both 
sites through the latest update of the CDMO macro and conducted final editing of 
the data.  Following final editing, Eric Wooden uploaded the database to the 
CBNERRVA server and to CDMO.  

3. Research Objectives
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain rural 
watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This watershed is 
dominated by forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land 
use component.  The drainage basin is suited for investigating hydrologic and 
non-point source water quality issues associated with changing land use 
patterns; these issues are of prime importance to the U.S. EPA Chesapeake Bay 
Program.  Continuously monitored physical water quality parameters (dissolved 
oxygen, pH, specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) provide long-term 
measurements which can be supplemented with shorter-term monitoring and process-
oriented studies.  Measurements were taken every 15 minutes at the Taskinas 
Creek site and the YSI dataloggers were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and 
calibrated at two-week intervals from early October to the end of May.  The two-
week intervals of YSI dataloggers deployments are increased to one-week 
intervals from beginning of June to late September.  This may vary from year to 
year and site to site depending on the amount of fouling on the instruments.
 
Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Goodwin Islands represent marsh islands surrounded by intertidal flats, 
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, oyster reefs, and shallow open 
estuarine waters.  Because minimal human activities occur within upland 
portions, the Goodwin Islands are suitable as a reference or control site for 
non-point source water quality issues.  Furthermore, due to extensive wetlands, 
intertidal, and submerged habitats, the Goodwin Islands are used extensively for 
SAV, material flux, and trophic interaction research activities.  Measurements 
were taken every 15 minutes at the Goodwin Islands site and the YSI dataloggers 
were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at two-week intervals from 
early October to the end of May.  The two-week intervals of YSI dataloggers 
deployments are increased to one-week intervals from beginning of June to late 
September.  This may vary from year to year and site to site depending on the 
amount of fouling on the instruments.

4.  Research methods 
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a long-term water quality-
monitoring program, which consists of two stations.  The Taskinas Creek station 
is located in the transitional zone of the York River tributary in the York 
River State Park.  A simple deployment was arranged with the State Park in 
September 1995, where the secured unit hung at a fixed depth (0.5 m above the 
creek bed) from an overhanging tree approximately six meters upstream from the 
parks canoe landing.  In September 1997, the deployment was modified so that the 
datalogger remained secure at all times within a 4-inch PVC housing 0.5 m above 
the bottom.  Three wood pilings were driven into the sediment in an equilateral 
triangle arrangement and the PVC pipe bolted to one piling.  Specific 
conductivity, pH, depth, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity are 
recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity and DO saturation are determined from 
temperature and specific conductivity readings.  At approximately two-week 
intervals or one-week intervals depending on the time of year, the data logger 
is returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, membrane replacement and 
recalibration.  Maintenance intervals are determined according to the amount of 
biofouling that occurs and to accommodate battery life.  A second YSI 6000 
datalogger is deployed following retrieval of the original YSI datasonde in 
order to maintain a continuous record.  Field verification of pH, dissolved 
oxygen, salinity, and temperature are taken during the deployment/retrieval 
procedure.  PH is tested in the lab with a Fisher Accumet pH Meter Model 600.  
Dissolved Oxygen was determined by a Winkler titration.  Salinity was determined 
by using a Rosemount Analytical Induction Salinometer.  Temperature was measured 
with a Hanna Instrument HI 9063 microcomputer K-thermocouple thermometer.  All 
YSI procedures are in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, sections 
3 and 7.  Standards for pH, and conductivity were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity 
standards were purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems.  
Data are reviewed and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing 
Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO manual.  

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a second long-term water quality-
monitoring program at Goodwin Islands, located at the mouth of the York River.  
This station is located on the southeastern side of the main island in a shallow 
embayment, approximately 400 meters from shore.  A stable and permanent 
structure was built in October 1997 where 4-inch PVC pipe is housed inside of a 
commercially available galvanized steel communications tower with the datalogger 
0.5 m from the bottom.  Specific conductivity, pH, depth, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature, and turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity and DO 
saturation are determined from temperature and specific conductivity readings. 
At approximately two-week intervals or one-week intervals depending on the time 
of year, the datalogger is returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, 
membrane replacement and recalibration.  Maintenance intervals are determined 
according to the amount of biofouling that occurs and to accommodate battery 
life.  A second YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed following retrieval of the 
original YSI datasonde in order to maintain a continuous record.  Field 
verification of pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature are taken during 
the deployment/retrieval procedure.  PH is tested in the lab with a Fisher 
Accumet pH Meter Model 600.  Dissolved Oxygen was determined by a Winkler 
titration.  Salinity was determined by using a Rosemount Analytical Induction 
Salinometer.  Temperature was measured with a Hanna Instrument HI 9063 
microcomputer K-thermocouple thermometer.  All YSI procedures are in accordance 
with the YSI operating manual methods, sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH, and 
conductivity were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity standards were purchased from 
Advanced Polymer Systems.  Data are reviewed and edited according to the YSI 
Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO manual.

5.  Site location and character

(1) Goodwin Islands (37 deg 13' 02.65093"; 76 deg 23' 32.75799")

The Goodwin Islands component of the CBNERR-VA is on the mouth of the York River 
at the northeastern tip of York County. Circulation patterns at the Goodwin 
Islands are influenced by York River discharge and the wind patterns of the 
Chesapeake Bay. The Goodwin Islands represent relatively pristine marsh islands 
surrounded by intertidal flats, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, oyster 
reefs, and shallow open estuarine waters.  Dominant marsh species include 
Saltmarsh Cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), Salt Grass (Distichlis spicata), 
and Saltmeadow Hay (Spartina patens).  Estuarine scrub/shrub vegetation 
dominates the forested ridges.  The sampling station is located in a shallow 
embayment on the southeastern side of the main island.  The station is located 
approximately 400 meters from shore, average water depth on the order of 1m, 
amongst submerged aquatic vegetation beds dominated by eelgrass (Zostera marina)
and Widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima).  Salinity at this site ranges from 9.9-27.5 
ppt and a multi-year average salinity is 19.3 ppt.  Tides are semi-diurnal and 
range from 0.4-1.1 m.  The data logger probes are located 0.5 m above the sandy 
substrate bottom.  Potential activities that could impact the site include light 
recreational and commercial boating activity.


(2) Taskinas Creek (37 deg 24' 54.04617"; 76 deg 42' 51.75733")

The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain rural 
watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  Taskinas Creek is a third 
order stream approximately 3 km in length and flows in a northeasterly direction 
eventually emptying into the York River.  This watershed is dominated by 
forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land use component.  
The non-tidal portion of Taskinas Creek contains feeder streams, which drain 
oak-hickory forests, maple-gum-oak-ash swamps and freshwater marshes.  Dominant 
low tidal creek marsh species include Saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina 
alterniflora), Salt Grass (Distichlis spicata), and Saltmeadow Hay (Spartina 
patens) at the creek mouth, three-square (Scirpus americanus and S. olneyi) and 
Big Cordgrass (Spartina cynosauroides) in the middle marsh reaches, and 
freshwater mixed (no single species covers more than 50%) wetlands in the 
upstream reaches.  The data logger station is located near the mouth of Taskinas 
Creek in the lower tidal creekbank region.  Water depth and width are 
approximately 2 and 20m, respectively.  Salinity at this site ranges from 0.2-
20.3 ppt and a multi-year average salinity is 9.6 ppt. Tides are semi-diurnal 
and range from 0.4-1.2 m.  The data logger probes are located 0.5 m above the 
mixed substrate (42% fine sand, 30% clay, and 28% silt) bottom.  Potential 
activities that could impact the site include residential development, selective 
hardwood logging, and light recreational boating activity.  Wildlife populations 
have been shown to influence microbiological water quality within the watershed.

6.  Data collection period:
Sampling at Taskinas Creek (TC) and Goodwin Islands (GI) began January 2000.  
Sampling was continuous at both sites through December 2000.  

7.  Associated researchers and projects:
A volunteer water quality monitoring program sponsored by the Alliance for the 
Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing at Taskinas Creek for several years, beginning 
January 10, 1990.  This project samples some overlapping parameters including 
dissolved oxygen and salinity on a two-week basis.

at the top of the page which identifies measurements and units for each column.

9. Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions 

Site definitions: TC = Taskinas Creek, GI= Goodwin Islands 
File definitions: YSI deployment site/month/year (example: TC0995 = Taskinas 
Creek data from September 1995). 

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data):
Frequent data anomalies were recorded in depth levels for several months 
potentially due to low-pressure weather fronts.  This data remained in the 
database.  According to the CDMO Operations Manual Version 3.0, depth 
measurements taken with the non-vented level probe can be influenced by up to 
0.39 m (1.3 ft) during some low-pressure hurricane events.  Specific dates and 
time ranges of potentially influenced data are listed with each respective 
month.  Starting with January, data were extracted in accordance with Version 
3.0 of the CDMO Manual.

12. Remarks

A) Any regions of data with negative depth values due to low tides or low-
pressure systems should be viewed with caution.  In some instances the probes 
are clearly out of water and have been noted.  Depth data should be considered 
relative depth. 

B) Due to conductance calibration error, salinity values were adjusted based on 
field verification samples taken at each datasonde deployment and retrieval. 
Datasonde specific conductance data were deleted and replaced with periods.  
Corrected salinity values are presented in edited and raw data files. Percent 
dissolved oxygen saturation values were computed based on equations provided by 
APHA Standard Methods 1989. No changes were made to raw dissolved oxygen 
concentration data.

C) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
