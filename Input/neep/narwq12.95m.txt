2.  Entry verification.

Other water quality measurements are made by standard field methods at the time 
of datalogger deployment and weekly thereafter.  Results are compared with YSI 
6000 data records.  Data may be corrected based on the comparative analyses and 
is then so noted in the data anomalies section of the metadata form.  
Temperature is measured by  mercury thermometer calibrated with a NBS certified 
thermometer.  Dissolved oxygen is determined by a modified Winkler titration.  
Salinity is measured with a Hydrolab Surveyor 3 equipped with a 
salinity/conductivity sensor.  The pH is determined by a Corning benchtop pH 
meter.  Turbidity is presently measured with a Secchi disk.  (This method does 
not provide data that is comparable to the YSI data.  An appropriate method 
recommended by the manufacturer and accepted by the scientific community will be 
used in the near future.)  Allan Beck is responsible for these water quality 
measurements.

Data is uploaded to a PC from the YSI datalogger using the PC6000 software in 
both the PC6000 format and in comma delimited format.  The comma delimited data 
is opened in Excel 5.0 and edited to remove headers and extra spaces.  Each file 
contains a months data and missing days are denoted by periods.  All files 
(December) have been verified using the Excel 5.0 macro programs which discover 
outliers (values out of the measurement range of the dataloggers).  Eleanor 
Kinney is responsible for formating and QA/QCing the data.  All data are 
archived on a Gateway PC at the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of 
Oceanography.  Data is then sent to CDMO via ftp.  

3.  Research objectives.

YSI6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR) Water Quality 
Monitoring Program.  The goal is to develop long-term datasets for 
representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over 
time. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time and 
measurements taken every 30 minutes.  Currently one station on Prudence, Potter 
Cove, has been established.   Potter Cove receives waste from boaters and is 
considered an impacted site.  In September, 1996, another monitoring station 
will be established within the reserve at an relatively unimpacted site at the 
southern tip of Prudence Island.

4.  Research Methods.

Before each deployment, routine maintenance and calibration of the YSI 
instrument is carried out.  The instrument is cleaned to remove any biofouling 
and the probes checked for cracks or other visible signs of damage.  O-rings are 
cleaned and greased, and batteries installed.  Calibrations are performed for 
salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, depth, and turbidity.  For the salinity 
calibration, filtered seawater from Narragansett Bay is collected and its 
salinity determined using an autosal.  This seawater is then used  as a salinity 
standard. A two point pH calibration is performed using premade buffer solutions 
of pH 7 and 9 obtained from Fisher Scientific. Old pH solutions are used for 
rinsing the probes.  The dissolved oxygen membrane is replaced 24 hours prior to 
calibration.  The DO probe is then calibrated by placing a wet sponge in the 
calibration cup and allowing the instrument to equilibrate as per the 
manufacturers instructions for 100% air saturation calibration.  The depth 
sensor is calibrated to sea level with the sonde standing up in air, calibration 
cup removed. Turbidity standard of 200 NTU has been ordered and will be diluted 
to 20 NTU and used in two point turbidity calibrations along with distilled 
water (NTU 0).  A one point calibration with distilled water was performed on 
the sonde containing a turbidity probe before its deployment.  

Currently one site, Potter Cove, which is found on the northern end of Prudence, 
is being monitored.  The sondes are deployed in a PVC tube with sections cut out 
to allow water flow.  The PVC tube is attached to a dock in the cove, and the 
instrument is deployed one meter above the bottom.    Another station is being 
set up on the T-wharf at the south end of the island and should be in use 
sometime in September, 1996.   The sondes are programmed to collect data every 
30 minutes during deployment.  Deployments generally last two to four weeks, 
depending on season.  At the end of each deployment, the data is uploaded, put 
in Excel format and QA/QC¹d using the Excel Macros provided by the CDMO.  

5. Site Location and Character.
The NARNERR  consists of 2200 acres of diverse estuarine and terrestrial 
habitats ranging from deep water to salt marshes to forested uplands.  The land 
holdings include 60% of Prudence Island, most of nearby Patience Island and all 
of Hope Island off the west shore of Prudence.  The Reserve is located close to 
the geographical center of Narragansett bay in Rhode Island.
	Tidal range:  -0.2 to 1.7 meters  MLW
	Salinity:  15 to 32 ppt
	Temperature:  -1.0 to 26 C
	Province:  North temperate, Virginian bioregion
	Lat. 41 38¹ 30²    Long. 71 20¹ 30²

Specific characteristics of the Potter Cove site are:
	Depth:  2.2 to 3.8 meters
	Bottom habitat:  Sand, silt, some organic mud
	Pollutants:  Boaters’ wastes
	Watershed:  Narragansett Bay, North Prudence (4801 square km)
	Location:  41 38¹ 25² N, 71 20¹ 28²W

6.  Data Collection Period

Potter Cove data collection began December 3, 1995 and is ongoing.  No turbidity 
sensors are installed yet.

 7.  Associated Researchers and Projects.

There is a research grade meteorological station located approximately 200 yards 
from the Potter Cove station.  Data are currently being collected by Chris 
Turner, R.I. Department of Environmental Management, Water Resources Division.  
Parameters measured include wind speed and direction, air temperature, humidity, 
precipitation, barometric pressure and solar radiation.
