2. Entry verification
Raw data were uploaded from the YSI 6600EDS data loggers to a PC, 
graphs were produced and data were visually examined after each deployment using 
the EcoWatch software. Data files were then exported from the EcoWatch format 
into Excel (for Windows 2000) files, where the headers, footers, and 
inappropriate spaces were removed.  Raw data was archived, plotted and suspect 
data (outliers) or trends noted initially to verify accurate instrument 
operation for service as needed prior to redeployment.  John Zimmerelli and 
Chris Trumbauer were responsible for these tasks.

Data from each deployment was processed initially using macros in the CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls program.  Steps in the program include procedures which allow users 
to automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places 
based on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows users to QA/QC each data 
logger generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not 
contain data with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range 
of what the data logger is designed to measure (outliers). The CDMO import.xls 
macro allows PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly 
Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data. 
Periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. In 
2004, John Zimmerelli with the help of Mark Trice at the Department of Natural 
Resources changed the import macro to allow PC users to import 15-minute data 
into this form. In addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to 
this macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point 
graphs on a monthly basis.

Raw data from successive deployments were merged using the CDMO import.xls 
macros to produce monthly files.  Resulting monthly Excel files at each site 
(eg. JB0302.xls) consist of continuous data for all variables measured, with a 
period (.) to denote any missing data.  At this point, these data have not been 
modified except for replacement of missing entries with a period. Data were then 
processed using the CDMO cdmomac3.xls macros as an initial step in QA/QC
procedures to identify outliers, defined simply as values outside the respective 
sensor specifications.  Results are retained as monthly Excel files for each 
site (eg. JB0302outliers.xls). 

The final data processing involved identification and documentation of data 
points judged to be anomalous (suspect) or erroneous due to extreme natural 
events or equipment malfunctions using various procedures including 
recommendations from CDMO Operations Manual Appendix B, YSI 6000 Data Review and 
Editing Protocol.  Anomalous data were retained in cases where no definite 
reason for deletion was found.  Periods during which data were found to result 
from equipment malfunctions, failure, tampering or exposure to air by low tides 
were identified, times with causes or related observations documented below and 
respective data removed or deleted. These resulting edited data and 
documentation (metadata) were archived, formatted in comma delimited file format 
and submitted to the CDMO for further QA/QC.  John Zimmerelli and Katie Diblasi
were responsible for these tasks.

3. Research Objectives        
The purpose of the monitoring program at CBM NERR is to conform to the NERR SWMP 
monitoring program looking at trends in water quality over both temporal and 
spatial scales. Observed effects of water quality, habitats and living resources 
in the river channel site and the nearby emergent tidal fresh marshes are being 
studied using various comparative field sampling methods with the backdrop of 
long term high resolution data from four representative fixed monitoring sites.  
Water quality measurements were taken every 15 minutes from April through 
December 2003 at the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (RR) site that conform to 
seasonal measurements collected each year since 1995.  In 2003, the Patuxent 
River Park (PR)site was moved to Mataponi Creek (MC), and the CBM NERR expanded 
its water quality component by two (2) stations.  These new stations were 
installed at Otter Point Creek (OC) and Ironpot Landing (IP), and measurements 
were taken every 15 minutes from April through December of 2003.

4. Research methods (YSI dataloggers)

Dataloggers and methods of deployments were replaced and upgraded during 2003 
after tests of existing YSI 6000 data loggers and consultation with YSI 
technicians determined new dataloggers with upgraded sensor packages to be 
more cost effective.  Deployment methods were changed considerably in 2003 to 
ensure a better quality of data.  New deployment apparatus' were constructed out 
of 4" diameter PVC pipe and suspended vertically in the water column.  2" 
diameter holes were cut into the PVC pipes at 2" intervals to guarantee free 
flow of water through the PVC pipe.  The pipe was painted with Interlux Micron 
Extra w/ Biolux antifouling paint.  The pipe was then attached to a 2X4 using 
copper plated clevis hangers.  The 2X4 was then bolted to a piling with the 
bottom of the PVC pipe resting on the bottom of the river.  A stop bolt was 
placed 0.25 meters from the bottom of the pipe to keep the YSI instrument at a 
constant depth.  Measurements for temperature, specific conductance, salinity, 
percent oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, water depth, pH, 
turbidity, and Chlorophyll were recorded every 15 minutes.  Deployments ranged 
from one to three weeks, depending on biofouling intensity (temperature 
dependent).  When a deployment concluded, dataloggers were replaced with newly 
serviced and calibrated instruments.  At the time of replacement two (2) 
simultaneous overlapping readings were taken between the old and new YSI 
instruments, as well as an in situ reading with a series 3 Hydrolab sonde.  All 
simultaneous overlapping readings were taken prior to the previously deployed 
sonde being disturbed in any way.  Once retrieved, the sondes are wrapped in a 
damp towel and placed in a cooler for transport back to the lab.  The sondes 
are then stored in the cooler overnight at the lab, continuing to log data every 
15 minutes.  DO post-calibration record is taken from this logged data the 
following morning.  Logging is then stopped, and YSI sondes are post calibrated 
using the same standards as used in the calibration.  Deployment data was 
collected, data was downloaded, archived, and then visually examined.  Efforts 
were made to relate sensor conditions to any apparent outliers or anomalies (eg. 
battery charge status, or normal DO data at the beginning of a deployment may be 
distinguished from erroneous data resulting from a known malfunction, such as a 
punctured DO membrane due to crabs).  Data loggers and sensors were cleaned, 
serviced and calibrated according to the methods described in the YSI Operating 
Manual and SWMP Operating Procedures.  Laboratory calibration procedures were 
carried out in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods.  Standards for 
turbidity were purchased from YSI.  Standards for pH and Chlorophyll were 
purchased from Fisher Scientific, a YSI approved vendor.  Specific conductance 
standards were prepared in-house, from A.C.S. certified KCl.  Data were reviewed 
and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B 
of the CDMO manual.  After cleaning the data loggers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) 
membrane were replaced and allowed to stretch for at least 24 hours before 
calibration.  The pH, specific conductance, depth, turbidity, and chlorophyll 
sensors were calibrated using the following methods: 2-point pH 7 and 10, 
specific conductance standard of the nearest concentration of river (ranging 
from 0.294 mS/cm to 58.64 mS/cm), zeroed depth in the air, 2-point turbidity 
standards of 0 (deionized water) and 123 NTUs for the 6136 turbidity sensor, and 
2-point chlorophyll standards of 0 (deionized water) and temperature dependant 
Rhodamine WT fluorescense standard typically at or near 118 ug/l as Chlorophyll.  
The DO sensor was calibrated using the YSI reccommended wet towel method.  As a 
quality insurance check, YSI datalogger records during sonde deployment and 
retrieval are compared to the series 3 Hydrolab instrument.  Post-deployment 
measurements of all the parameters were recorded before cleaning the data 
loggers. Sensors were immersed in  the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., pH) 
and readings recorded using discreet sampling.  

5. Site location and character
The Chesapeake Bay Maryland NERR has three components in Maryland's portion of 
Chesapeake Bay.  Monie Bay is a mesohaline region on the lower Eastern Shore; 
Otter Point Creek is a tidal freshwater tributary of the Bush River; and Jug Bay 
is part of the freshwater portion of the Patuxent River.  Three (3) of the data 
loggers during 2003 were within the Jug Bay component and one (1) logger was in 
the Otter Point Creek component.

     Mataponi Creek (MC) 38° 44.599'N, 76° 42.446'W (NAD83) or 38.74331667,
			  -76.70743333 (GIS format)
 
Site MC is located in a small tributary off the upper tidal headwaters of the 
Patuxent River, Maryland.  MC is 2.4 km upstream of the mouth, midchannel in 
the creek, which is approximately 7m wide.  The southern bank is steep and 
covered mainly with hardwood trees while the Northern bank is tidal marsh.  The 
sonde was deployed vertically in a perforated PVC pipe.  Average depth at this 
site is roughly 0.7 meters with a mean tidal fluctuation of approximately 0.6 
m..  The YSI is deployed 0.25 m off of the creek bottom.  Salinities at this 
site rarely exceed 0.1 ppt.  The bottom habitat is soft sediment, and SAV 
grassbeds are abundant during the summer months.  Because this site is located 
along the main channel of the Mataponi Creek, water quality is reflective of the 
general quality of water flowing along the main portion of the creek. The SAV 
community as this site is seasonally very dense and thus water quality is 
thought to be strongly influenced by the presence of SAV during the summer 
months.

     Railroad Bridge (RR) 38° 46.877'N, 76° 42.822'W (NAD 83) or 38.78128333,
			 -76.7137 (GIS format)

Jug Bay is a 722-acre tidal estuary providing a narrow transition zone between 
brackish marshes and upland freshwater wetlands. The broad, shallow waters of 
Jug Bay support a profusion of freshwater plants and animals. Vegetation crowds 
the river channel and forms an interlaced pattern of tidal and nontidal marshes, 
swamps and forested wetlands surrounded by upland woods and fields.  Site RR is 
located in the mainstem of the upper tidal headwaters of the Patuxent River, 
Maryland.  The site is slightly upstream (roughly 0.3km) from Jackson's Landing 
at the Patuxent River Park (previous PR site). This section of the Patuxent 
river is approximately 70m wide and average depth at the site is 1.4m.  The YSI 
is deployed 0.25 m off of the river bottom.  Bottom habitat is soft sediment, 
and grassbeds are evident in the area during summer months.  Mean tidal  
fluctuation is approximately 0.6 m.  Salinity in 2003 ranged from 0.05 - 0.4 
ppt.  In 2003 this site was moved from 38° 46' 50.6" N, 76° 42' 29.1" W (Jug 
Bay) to its present location because of the shallow nature of the old site.  The 
new site location (RR) is at the end of the old railroad bed and is deployed 
vertically in a perforated PVC pipe near midchannel of the Patuxent River.  
Because this site is located along the main channel of the Patuxent River, water 
quality is reflective of the general quality of water flowing along the main 
portion of the river.  The site is roughly 1km downstream of the confluence of 
the Western Branch tributary and the Patuxent River Mainstem, thus water quality 
is influenced by Western Branch.  A large wastewater treatment plant (averaging 
10-20 mgd ) discharges directly into the Western Branch tributary of the 
Patuxent River just upstream of IP.  

	Iron Pot Landing (IP) 38° 47.760'N, 76° 43.248' W (NAD 83) 
				or 38.796, -76.7208 (GIS Format)

Site IP is located 2.09km from the mouth of Western Branch.  IP is attached 
vertically off of a small pier near midchannel of the river and has an average 
depth of 1.6m.  The YSI is deployed 0.25 m off of the river bottom.  The site is 
roughly 1km downstream of a large (10-20 mgd) wastewater treatment plant 
effluent.  The river is approximately 15m wide and flows through extensive 
riparian buffers.  Both banks of the river are flanked by hardwood flora.  Tides 
are semi-diurnal and mean tidal fluctuation is approximately 0.6 m.  Salinity at 
this site is generally 0.1 ppt.  Bottom habitat is soft sediment, and grassbeds 
are evident during the summer months.  This site is part of the NERR build out 
and is new for 2003.

	Otter Point Creek (OC) 39° 27.047'N, 76° 16.474'W (NAD 83) 
				or 39.45078333, -76.27456667 (GIS Format)

Otter Point Creek is a tributary of the Bush River in the upper Chesapeake Bay 
and consists of 672 acres of open water, tidal marshes, forested wetlands and 
upland hardwood forests, surrounded by major highways, large residential 
communities, and heavy commercial and industrial development.  Site OC is 
located approximately 0.3km from the Anita C. Leight Estuary Center.  OC is 
deployed vertically in a perforated PVC pipe and has an average depth of 0.7m.  
The YSI is deployed 0.25 m off of the creek bottom.  Bottom habitat is extremely 
soft sediment, and grass beds inundate the site during summer months.  Salinity 
at this station rarely rises above 0.1 ppt.  Tides in Otter Point Creek are 
semi-diurnal and have a mean range of about 0.3 m. The average water levels are 
generally lower in the winter due to north and northwest winds that increase the 
egress from Chesapeake Bay.  The sonde was periodically exposed to very low  
tides, and sediments at the site are extremely fine and flocculent.  Because of 
the shallowness of the tidal marsh, coupled with the dramatic daily changes in 
the depth and width of the stream, deployments at the site presented many 
problems.  These problems included periodic exposure of the sonde, very high 
turbidity and sedimentation rates associated with tidal infiltration and wind 
and wave generated resuspension which caused severe fouling of the probes.  
Water quality at the site represented extreme shallow water habitats.  Thus it 
is not uncommon to see very large fluctuations in temperature and dissolved 
oxygen at this site ranging from complete anoxia to full saturation, due in part 
to the shallow nature of the site and the effects of marsh processes on water 
quality.  Additionally, the site was dominated by dense SAV communities from 
June-October 2003 and thus water quality conditions were likely influenced by 
the presence of these macrophytes.

The Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary staff has been collecting weekly to monthly 
temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient samples at the same 
location as the data logger at JB until 2003.   The Anita C. Leight Estuary 
Center at Otter Point Creek, in conjunction with CBNERR/MD staff has also been 
collecting bi-weekly to monthly temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, total 
suspended solids, chlorophyll a, and nutrient samples at the same location as 
datalogger OC for 2003.  Additional discrete data is also available that 
provides increased spatial coverage of many of the same parameters around both 
RR and OC sites for 2003.

11. Data anomalies (suspect data)
Any data outliers detected using CDMO macros and any data deletions are detailed 
below. Suspect and outlier data were detected and considered for deletion from 
the edited data using combination of methods, including ECOWATCH graphical 
software and CDMO macros.  All outliers are detailed below. Any data determined 
to be due to instrument errors or malfunctions were retained in raw data. 
Missing data and any intended deletions from edited data were replaced with a 
period (.) in accordance with CDMO QA/QC guidelines and detailed below. 
According to the CDMO Operations Manual Version 4.0, depth measurements taken 
with the non-vented level probe can be influenced by up to 0.39 m (1.3 ft) 
during some low-pressure hurricane events.  Specific dates and time ranges of 
potentially influenced data are listed with each respective month.

Anomalous DO spike in data on 09/02/2003 14:30:00 was deleted. Reason for spike 
unknown.  

October 2003
Negative depths retained in data set for month of October because salinity 
showed meter to be in water, possibly changes in pressure caused negative 
readings. (Depth Not Vented)

In-situ match-up readings on 10/14/03 exhibit high deviation from check meter 
and Hydrolab instrument.  It is likely due to variation in depth rather than 
instrument malfunction.  SAV beds at sight make it difficult to put YSI, check 
YSI, and Hydrolab at same depth.  Data retained but should be considered 
suspect.
10/14/03	12:30:00

Following record logged by check meter (Babs), meter does not have depth sensor.

05/12/2003	09:00:00 - 05/12/2003 11:45:00

Turbidity matchup for retrieval of the sonde on 5/28/03 is off. Determined the 
approximate point where upward drift started and deleted all subsequent data for 
that deployment.  
05/23/2003	11:00:00 - 05/28/2003	10:15:00	

Depth measurements were lower than normal after deployment on 5/28 10:30 through 6/3 1230. 
Sonde appeared to be in the water during this time.    

June 2003
Depth measurements were lower than normal after deployment on 5/28 10:30 through 6/3 1230.
Sonde appeared to be in the water during this time.       

The following negative depth readings were removed.  The data recorded at these 
times was not deleted because the meter was not out of the water.  There may 
have been something blocking the depth sensor. 
06/03/2003	12:30:00 - 12:45:00

Depth measurements suddenly spiked after deployment on 6/3 12:45 through 6/3 1415 but 
returned.  Sonde appeared to be in the water during this time.     

The following turbidity data point was found as an outlier by the NERR macro, 
but was not deleted.  The high turbidity value was a result of a rain event.  
There may have been a sewage overflow upstream.  Turbidity values did not return 
to under 50 NTU until 6/28/2003 at about 14:00:00. 
6/27/2003	19:45:00

on probe or wiper.  
08/04/2003	15:15:00 - 08/05/2003	09:30:00

The following reading was taken from check sonde.  The deployed meter was out of 
the water for data retrieval.  The check sonde used was "CINDY," which does not 
have a depth sensor.  Therefore, we do not have a depth reading for this data 
point.

was out of the water for data retrieval.  No Depth recorded for this data point.  
10/01/2003	10:00:00

DO membrane punctured.  The following DO data set deleted.
10/07/2003	09:30:00 - 10/14/2003	09:45:00

Drop in dissolved oxygen on 10/20/2003 18:30:00 (13.7%). Data suspect, but 
retained. 	

Check sonde (BABS) in water for the following 2 readings. The deployed sonde  
was out of the water for data retrieval.  "Babs" does not have a depth sensor, 
so there are no depth readings for these intervals.  
10/14/2003	10:00:00 - 10:15:00

The deployed sonde, "HeMan," had a bad DO membrane, so it was not redeployed. 
The check sonde could not be deployed immediately because it was needed for 
other sites.  "Babs" was returned at Iron Pot Landing at the end of the field 
day.  It was re-deployed at 12:30:00.  Thus there is no data for the following 
period:
10/14/2003 10:00:00 - 12:15:00

sonde, but determined to be anomolous.  All parameters were removed for the 
following sates/times: 
10/28/2003	12:45:00

No Depth data recorded for the following period because we had to deploy a 
backup sonde because the DO membrane was punctured on the deployed meter.  The 
backup sonde ("Babs") had no depth sensor.  
10/14/03 12:30:00 - 10/22/03 10:00:00.

12) Missing data
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

For the following deployments, the dataloggers were not equipped with depth 
sensors, therefore depth data was not collected:
Site MC	11/04/2003 	12:15:00 – 11/13/2003 11:45:00
Site IP 04/08/2003	10:00:00 – 04/15/2003 12:30:00


13) Post Deployment Information
End of deployment Post-calibration Readings in Standard Solutions:
na = no data available for that particular standard
