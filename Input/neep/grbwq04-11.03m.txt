2. Entry verification
At two sites the data are transmitted every thirty minutes from YSI 6600 
datasondes via VHF packet radio using Ecowatch software to a base station PC. At 
the other two sites data are collected in an unattended mode and stored in the 
instruments internal memory.  Files are first examined and graphed using 
Ecowatch software.  Missing and/or  anomalous data are noted. Files are then 
transferred to a Macintosh computer and opened in Microsoft Excel software and 
edited. Missing data due to routine YSI maintenance and probe failure or 
communication errors are inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods 
(.). Periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. 
Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Files are 
verified by means of CDMO Excel macros. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow 
the user to automatically format column widths to the correct number decimal 
places based on the YSI sensor specifications. It also allows the user to QA/QC 
each data logger generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do 
not contain data with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the 
range of what the datalogger is designed to measure (outliers). The CDMO 
import.xls macro will allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create 
a monthly Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing 
data. Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data. In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing point graphs on a monthly basis. All files 
are graphed in Excel and examined by Jaimie Wolf in order that anomalous data 
points can be identified.


3. Research Objectives
In 2003, YSI 6600 datasondes were deployed in Great Bay and in the Squamscott, 
Oyster and Lamprey Rivers part of the National Estuarine Research Reserves' 
(NERRS) System-wide Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to develop and 
maintain temporally intensive long-term datasets of physio-chemical parameters 
of water quality at locations that are representative of the Great Bay Estuarine 
System. The Great Bay site is relatively unimpacted, while the three tidal river 
sites (Lamprey, Oyster and Squamscott) have large drainage basins and are 
impacted by both point (wastewater treatment plants) and nonpoint sources of 
pollution. In addition to establishing a baseline of water quality, and 
understanding the spatial and temporal variability of important indicators of 
estuarine water quality, the data is used by a number of researchers in the 
analysis of physical and biological processes.


4. Research Methods
Datasondes are programmed to obtain measurements of specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, pH, temperature, water level, 
and turbidity every half-hour. All sondes used in 2003 were model 6600 equipped 
with non-vented depth sensors. The instruments are deployed continuously during 
ice-free seasons, except for brief periods when they are removed for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration. Pre and post-deployment calibrations are 
performed using the diagnostics menu of the YSI Ecowatch program and QA/QC 
procedures developed by NERR Research Coordinators and YSI engineers. 
VWR conductivity and pH standards are used for calibration. YSI turbidity 
standard is used to calibrate turbidity probes. In previous years the sonde in 
Great Bay was deployed in a YSI EM 550 buoy, however after the first few weeks 
of the 2003 deployment, the buoys radio ceased to operate. It was sent to YSI 
for repair but the company no longer supports this equipment so was unable 
to repair it.  For the rest of the year the Great Bay sonde was moored one meter 
off the bottom in central Great Bay.
The Lamprey and Squamscott river stations are piling mounted deployments (see 
below).  Due to shallow depths and narrow channels, the Oyster River sonde has 
to be deployed with the least amount of vertical expression above bottom.  This 
is accomplished by placing it horizontally in a perforated PVC pipe with four 
weighted "legs" to keep the instrument above bottom.  The Oyster River sonde is 
hard-wired to a radio telemetry station on shore (approximately 25 meters away).

Site definitions: GB = Great Bay, SQ = Squamscott River, LR = Lamprey 
River, OR = Oyster River


11. Data Anomalies:
Anomalous data is usually the result of fouling of the probes, probe failure, 
out of range data, or defective equipment. Removed anomalous and retained 
suspect data are listed below. 
Occasionally the values for specific conductivity and salinity will drift 
downward at the end of deployments. This is most likely caused by sediment 
build-up on the probe.

Great Bay
April
No data 4/1 0000 to 4/16 1500. Sonde not yet deployed

No depth data 4/16 1530 to 4/23 1330. Sonde was in the floating buoy at this 
point and the Squamscott sonde had not yet been deployed. GB depth data was 
calculated based upon SQ data during times the GB sonde was deployed in the 
buoy.

No data 4/23 1330 to 4/25 1330. The buoy radio ceased reporting to the lab, so 
the equipment was taken to the lab for trouble-shooting.Subsequently the sonde 
was deployed at a mooring because the buoy radio was not operational for the 
remainder of the year.

No data 4/28 730 to 4/30 2330. The sonde ceased recording for unknown reasons. 
Upon retrieval it was found that batteries were fully charged and sufficient 
memory remained. Possible equipment failure or malfunction.

No turbidity data 4/16 1900. Data was out of range and deleted. 335.8 NTU
Between 4/17 0000 and 4/26 2300 there were 168 negative turbidity values. All 
were deleted.

No pH data 4/16 1530 to 4/23 1300 and 4/25 1400 to 4/28 700. All values were out 
of range (abnormally high) and deleted. Possible probe malfunction.

The following dissolved oxygen data was deleted because it was out of range.
4/28 130 172.0
4/28 400 166.4


May
No data 5/1 000 to 5/15 900. Sonde stopped recording for unknown reasons. This 
was the same deployment that began in April. It was not possible to ascertain 
that the sonde was not recording until the end of the deployment because the 
buoy radio failed in April. This sonde was sent to YSI for repairs.

No turbidity data 5/16 1930. Data was out of range and deleted. 367.0 NTU
In May there were 204 negative turbidity values. All were deleted.
 

June
The turbidity wiper became stuck over the optics on 6/12 2130 until the end of 
the deployment. All values were over 700 NTU and were deleted. No turbidity data 
6/12 2130 to 6/30 1100.

The following negative turbidity values were deleted.
06/01/2003	01:30:00			-0.3
06/01/2003	02:00:00			-1.9
06/01/2003	02:30:00			-0.4
06/01/2003	03:00:00			-0.8
06/01/2003	03:30:00			-1.5
06/01/2003	04:00:00			-1.1
06/01/2003	15:30:00			-0.7
06/02/2003	03:00:00			-0.4
06/02/2003	03:30:00			-0.5
06/02/2003	04:00:00			-0.3

No data 6/03 1430 Instruments being swapped for new deployment.

Conductivity probe failed 6/24 300. For the period 6/24 300 to 6/30 1100 (end of 
deployment) the following data was out of range and deleted: Specific 
conductivity, salinity, DO mg/l. Although depth data is normally affected when a 
conductivity probe fails, the data seemed to be correct. The depth data may be 
suspect but was retained. 

DO% was also out of range 6/24 300 to 6/30 1100, therefore data were deleted. 


July
No data 7/14 1530. Instruments were being swapped for new deployment.
The tide signal data changes on the 7/14 deployment date because the sonde was 
not returned to exactly the same depth it had been placed during the prior 
deployment. Data is retained.

Dissolved oxygen data drifts upward from 7/2 until the end of the deployment on 
7/14 probably due to fouling. The data is suspect but was retained.


August
No data 8/8 900 to 1600 because the sonde in lab for cleaning and calibration.

No data 8/28 1330 Instruments being swapped for new deployment.

Turbidity data was deleted on the following dates because it was above normal 
range. These values ranged from 101.1 to 1714.5.
8/7 1000,1500,1830,1900,2000,2100
8/8 000 to 100, 230 - 430, 530, 830
8/13 500
8/22 830
8/24 800, 1130, 1200
8/26 2330
8/27 000, 1230, 1700
8/29 230 Turbidity was negative 0.2 and deleted.

8/28 1400 to 8/31 2330 pH data somewhat low possibly due to eelgrass found to be 
wrapped on probes upon retrieval of sonde on 9/12. Data suspect but retained.

Dissolved oxygen values drift downward (range 69.1 - 90.1) at the end of the 
deployment that ended 8/28 probably due to fouling. The post calibration value 
was 105.8%. DO data deleted 8/23 2330 to 8/28 1300.

There was a steady decrease in salinity values from 8/1 to 8/8 due to heavy rain 
during that period. Data is retained.


September
There were 942 negative turbidity values in September. All were deleted.

The following out of range turbidity values were also deleted.
9/14 900 203.8 NTU
9/14 1000 176.3 NTU
9/26 730 3081.5 NTU

From 9/12 1030 to 9/30 2330 all but 15 turbidity values were negative, so all 
were deleted for this period because the probe was obviously malfunctioning.
Eelgrass was found wrapped around the probes at the end of the deployment.

From 9/1 000 to 9/12 1000 pH values were lower than for the rest of the month, 
possibly due to eelgrass fouling. Data is suspect but retained.

There are several DO spikes over 150% perhaps due to intermittent eelgrass 
interference. Data is outside normal range, suspect but retained.

The reduction in salinity at the end of the month is due to 27mm rain on 
September 23.


October
No turbidity 10/1 000 to 10/14 1000. All values except 21 were negative, so all 
were deleted for this period. Eelgrass was found to be wrapped around the probes 
at the end of the deployment.

The following turbidity values were also out of range and deleted.
10/14 100  105.3
10/25 230  121.8
10/26 700  462.5
10/26 800  204.3
10/29 130  742.4
10/29 200  318.6

pH values drift downward in the middle of October perhaps due to rain on the 
12th and 15th (63mm) or end of deployment fouling. Data is suspect but was 
retained.

DO% data out of range (high) 10/14 1030 to 10/31 2330. Data were deleted.

All specific conductivity, temperature, and salinity was also aberrant 10/14 
1030 to 10/31 2330, so evidently the specific conductivity probe malfunctioned. 
Though pre and post deployment calibration values were normal. DO mg/L, 
salinity, specific conductivity and temperature data were deleted for this 
period. Although depth data is normally affected when a conductivity probe 
fails, the data seemed to be correct. The depth data may be suspect but was 
retained. 



November
No data 11/7 1030 sondes swapped for new deployment

No turbidity 11/14 1130, out of range (136.4NTU) and deleted.

From 11/7 1100 to 11/13 630, 38 negative turbidity values were deleted.

From 11/1 000 to 11/7 1000 (end of deployment) pH values drift down possibly due 
to fouling or probe malfunction. Data is suspect but was retained.

Specific conductivity, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen deleted for the 
period of 11/1 000 to 11/7 1030 because of failure of specific conductivity 
probe.

No data 11/25 1100 to 11/30 2330. Sonde was removed for the winter.


Squamscott River
April
No data 4/1 000 to 4/23 1530. Sonde not yet deployed.

20 negative turbidity values were deleted.

4/29 800 102.1 NTU out of range and deleted..

May
No data 5/22 0830 Sondes swapped for new deployment. 

122 negative turbidity values were deleted.

The following turbidity values were out of range (high) and deleted.
5/3 1000  99.9

5/28 1800  119.8
5/29 1030  711.7
5/29 1130  1473.5

No pH data 5/12 1100 to 5/22 800. Data out of range (0 - 18.7) and was deleted. 
This probe was less than a year old, yet it failed. Extra pH probes were back 
ordered, so the sonde was replaced on 5/22 after a 10 day deployment.

On the following dates DO values were out of range and deleted. This was 
probably temporary fouling because DO levels recovered to normal range later 
during the same deployment. The deleted DO values ranged from 142% to 241%No 
dissolved oxygen data:
5/27 700-730, 900-1030,1400,2300
5/28  030-100, 200-400, 500-730, 830, 930-1000, 1130, 1600-1700,1800, 1900-1930.

6/13 830  108.9
6/16 2300  103
6/17  1230  106.9

Slight drop in pH from 6/18 to 6/24 is probably due to rain on June 18-23. Data 
retained. 

6/24 1100 to 6/31 2330 DO range is lower than normal perhaps due to fouling. 
Post deployment DO value was 85%. Data is suspect but was retained.


July
The following out of range and negative turbidity values were deleted.
7/25 1900  -2.2
7/25 2230  -1.9
7/25 2330  -1.8
7/27 1900  -2.6
7/30 000  183.7

7/1 000 to 7/3 1830 Dissolved oxygen range lower than normal, perhaps end of 
deployment drift. Data is suspect but was retained.

Temperature probe failed shortly after the beginning of the 7/3 deployment. 
Temperatures ranged from 25 - 33C. 7/3 1830 to 7/9 830 specific conductivity, 
salinity, DO mg/l, temperature and pH were deleted. Although depth data is 
normally affected when a temperature probe fails, the data seemed to be correct. 
The depth data may be suspect but was retained. 

From 7/11 to 7/20 pH values are somewhat lower than normal. This is probably due 
to heavy rain on 7/11, 7/16 and 7/19. Data was retained.

7/19 1600 to 7/21 830 DO data out of range probably due to end of deployment 
drift and fouling and was deleted.

7/25 1900 DO out of range DO% 210.1 mg/l 14.72. Data was deleted.

DO aberrant (low) 7/27 130 to 7/31 1130, probably from probe fouling. Data was 
deleted.

No data 7/31 1200 to 2330. Instrument stopped recording for unknown reasons. 
Batteries and memory were okay. Sonde subsequently was found to be 
malfunctioning and was returned to YSI for repair.


August
No data 8/1 000 to 8/6 830. Sonde stopped recording, equipment defect, repaired 
by YSI.

Turbidity values were negative on the following dates and deleted.
8/8 830, 1030,1900
8/9 1930, 2330
8/27 1300, 1330, 1430
8/28 100, 130
8/29 200

Turbidity values were above normal range on the following dates and deleted.
8/10 000 
8/23 1130
8/25 530, 700-1030
8/29 730

No turbidity data 8/25 1530 to 8/26 2000. All values were over 100. Possibly the 
wiper or an organism became stuck over the optics for that period of time. Data 
was deleted.

Between 8/23 and 8/25 turbidity values are somewhat higher than normal. A crab 
was discovered in the sonde guard and it could have been interfering with the 
probes. Data was retained because it was not over 99NTU.

No turbidity data 8/29 1500 to 8/31 2330. The instrument recorded only zeros. 
This was the first deployment of a new 6600 EDS sonde which was discovered to 
have a defect or maladjustment. It was returned to YSI and repaired.

DO was out of range and deleted on the following dates.
8/8 830  206.1, 1030  185.3, 1130  141.8, 1330  148.5, 1900  224.3
8/9 1200 192.9, 1830  143.9, 1930  234.1, 2330  170.5
8/10 000  211. 1000 168.7

No DO data 8/28 1830 to 8/29 1300. Data was extremely aberrant (including 
negative numbers, ranged from -6.9 to 142.4). No explanation for this as post 
deployment DO value was 106.3. Possibly malfunctioning probe or interference by 
debris.

No DO data 8/29 1500 to 8/31 2330. Values extremely low, out of range and 
deleted.

No data 8/29 1330 to 1430. Instruments were being swapped for new deployment. 
The sonde was only out from 8/27 to 8/29 and had to be replaced because of the 
DO readings.

No data 8/31 700 to 800. Sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.

Salinity values are higher at low tide in the second half of August because 
there was rain almost every day from August 1 to 16, and the remainder of the 
month was dry.


September
No data for the following dates. Instrument failed to record for unknown 
reasons.
9/1 1030, 1200

9/24 730 - 800
9/25 730, 830

No turbidity data 9/1 000 to 9/25 1530. The instrument returned only zeros for 
this deployment. It was later found that the sonde was faulty and it was 
returned to YSI for repair.

No turbidity data 9/30 1700, value out of range (2306.3), deleted.

No DO data 9/1 000 to 9/25 1530 and 9/25 1600 to 9/30 2330. Data very aberrant, 
and out of range. For the month of September DO% values ranged from 49 to 240. 
Possibly debris in the pvc pipe was interfering with the water flow.


October
No data 10/9 1200 sondes being swapped for new deployment.

No DO data 10/1 000 to 10/9 1130.  Values too high, range from153% to 235%. Data 
deleted.

Turbidity was out of range and deleted for the following dates.
10/27 000  132.6
10/28 130  338.2
10/29 1300  152.2

10/31 2300  804
10/31 2330  743.2


The following DO data was out of range and deleted.
10/30 1530  137.1
10/30 1600  224.2
10/31 530  130.8
10/31 600  120.9

Lower salinity values from 10/16 to 10/17 and 10/29 to 10/31 are the result of 
heavy rain on 10/15 and 10/27-29.


November
No data 11/3 1330
Date		Time       Temp  SpCond  Sal	 DO	DO	Depth	  pH	 Turb

All data is wrong for this time. Data deleted for all parameters. Possible 
temporary interference by debris or eelgrass.

There were 76 negative turbidity values in November. All were deleted.

There were 44 out of range (high) turbidity values from 11/ 1 to 11/25. They 
ranged from 100 to 1900 NTU and were deleted.

No pH 11/3 1700 8.26 Out of range, deleted.

No temperature 11/3 230 9.27. This was not probable because the temperatures 
before and after 230 were over 11 degrees. Data point deleted.

Water temperature declines then rises between 11/13 and 11/25. The air 
temperature also increased for the same period, so the data is correct.

DO data aberrant 11/1 000 to 11/6 1100. Values ranged from 61.8% to 315%. 
Possibly end of deployment fouling. Data was deleted.

DO out of range 11/7 1000 to 11/9 1130. Ranged from 55.3% to 85.5%. Values lower 
than normal and were deleted. Possible probe failure.

All DO data from 11/13 1000 to 11/25 1200 were extremely aberrant ranging from 
39% to 150.9%, possibly due to debris in the pvc pipe or probe malfunction. Data 
was deleted.

No data 11/25 1230 to 11/30 2330. Instrument removed for the winter.


Lamprey River
April
No data 4/1 000 to 4/23 1530. Sonde not yet deployed.

No turbidity for 4/23 1600 to 4/30 2330. All (352) values were negative and were 
deleted. Pre and post deployment calibrations were satisfactory.

Salinity is low 4/27 to 4/30 as a result of heavy rain on 4/26.


May
There were 1102 negative turbidity values in May. All were deleted. Post and pre 
deployment calibrations were satisfactory so perhaps the probe malfunctioned 
during deployment.

The instrument failed to record for unknown reasons on the following dates.
No data:
5/20 130 ñ 330

5/31 100
5/31 500

No pH data 5/13 1030 to 5/31 2330. pH out of range (5.66 - 6.65). Pre and post 
deployment calibrations on this probe were correct, possible contamination of 
probe in the field by eelgrass or other.

Salinity is low during periods beginning 5/14 and 5/27 due to heavy rains.


June
On 6/1 00:00 and 6/2 1330 64 negative turbidity values were deleted.

No data for the following dates. The instrument failed to record for unknown 
reasons.
6/1 530-600
6/1 730-830
6/1 1030
6/1 1200

No pH data 6/1 000 to 6/2 1400. Data out of range (5.66 to 7.54) and was 
deleted. Possible probe contamination.

No pH data 6/25 1100 to 6/30 2330. Data out of range (high) and was deleted. 
Post deployment calibration value was 7.57 so probe may have been fouled or 
malfunctioning.


July
108 negative turbidity values deleted in July.

No turbidity 7/31 2100. Out of range (126.5) and deleted.

No pH data 7/1 00:00 to 7/11 1300. Out of range and deleted. Possible probe 
malfunction.


August
552 negative turbidity values were deleted.

8/23 0500 through 8/31 2330 most turbidity values were negative. Since probe was 
clearly malfunctioning, all turbidity data for that period was deleted.

No data 8/11 1330 to 8/13 1230. Sonde in the lab. At this time there were no 
extra instruments to swap because they were back ordered.

DO values lower than normal 8/1 to 8/5. Possibly due to heavy rains during those 
five days. (almost 3 inches.) Data was retained.

Low salinity 8/2 to 8/17 resulted from heavy rains.


September
124 negative turbidity values were deleted.

The following turbidity values were out of range and deleted.
9/30 2000  795.8
9/30 2100  1428

No DO data 9/19 830 to 9/24 530. Data was out of range and deleted. (12.6% to 
90.1%) This occurred in the middle of a deployment and the data subsequently 
returned to normal range. So it is possible that something temporarily attached 
to the probe, interfering with its function.

Low salinity at the end of September is due to heavy rainfall on 9/23 and 9/26.


October
538 negative turbidity values were deleted in October.

10/17 2100 to 10/31 2330 most turbidity values were negative for this period. 
Probe was obviously malfunctioning or fouled so all turbidity was deleted.
Turbidity 10/2 100  482.3 NTU out of range, deleted.

pH slightly higher than normal at the end of deployment which ended on 10/14. 
Possible end of deployment fouling. Data is suspect but was retained.

No pH data 10/28 2000 to 10/31 2330. Data was out of range (low) and deleted. 
Data ranged from 5.67 to 7.09. Possible end of deployment fouling.

No DO data 10/14 1500 to 10/15 2100. Data was out of range (67.2% - 76.6%). Data 
subsequently recovered to normal levels. Possible temporary probe interference 
by organism or eelgrass.

Salinity is low on 10/30 to 10/31 due to heavy rain from 10/27 to 10/29.


November
No turbidity data 11/1 000 to 11/6 1130. Out of 264 data points, 220 were 
negative, so all were deleted for this period. Possible probe malfunction.

No pH data 11/1 000 to 11/6 1130. Data out of range (5.6 - 6.9). Possible end of 
deployment fouling.

All DO data from 11/6 1230 to 11/25 1100 is questionable. The data is at times 
very much higher than is normal. The sonde may have moved or been moved within 
its pvc pipe. The data is suspect but was retained.

Periods of extremely low salinity from 11/1 to 11/10 due to heavy rain.

No data 11/25 1130 to 11/30 2330. Instrument removed for the winter.

DO values drifts down from 7/1 000 to 7/9 1030. Possibly end of deployment 
drift. Data is questionable but was retained.

Between 7/9 and 7/22 some aberrant DO data, including negative values. This DO 
probe was only one year old. Passed pre deployment calibration and failed post 
deployment calibration. Out of range DO was deleted on the following dates.
7/12 200 - 1000
7/16 630 - 700

7/28 130
7/31 300 ñ 1130

7/9 to 7/22 salinity is somewhat lower than previous and subsequent deployments 
in July. Possibly due to sonde being placed in a slightly different position. 
Data was retained.


August

No DO data 8/13 1100 to 8/14 1230. DO values jumped to over 500%. Post 
deployment DO calibration was 107.7%. Possibly something attached to the 
membrane, which was washed off when the sonde was retrieved. Data was deleted.

DO data was out of range (high) and deleted for the following dates.
8/1 1830
8/20 1400 to 8/22 630
8/22 1530 - 1830
8/23 800 to 8/25 930

8/28 1530 - 8/29 030
8/29 830 ñ 8/31 2330
When the sonde was retrieved on 9/8 eelgrass was found to be wrapped around some 
probes. This could have interfered with the functioning of the DO probe.

Salinity drops 8/2 930 to 1230 as a result of heavy rain on 8/1 and 8/2.


September
No data 9/1 2130 and 9/1 2230 - 9/2 1000. Instrument failed to record for 
unknown reasons.

The following turbidity data was out of range and deleted.
9/3 1800

No DO data 9/1 000 - 9/30 2330. DO values for the entire month were extremely 
aberrant, ranging from 14.8% to 210%. Fishing line was found wrapped around 
probes when the sonde was retrieved on 9/8. At the end of the second September 
deployment, it was discovered that the membrane was punctured, probably by a 
crab that was living in the sonde guard.All of September DO data had to be 
deleted for these reasons.

Salinity drifts downward 9/1 to the end of the deployment on 9/8 probably due to 
fouling, then resumes normal values with 9/8 deployment.  Data is questionable 
but was retained.

Low salinity values on 9/24 caused by heavy rain on 9/23.


October
76 turbidity values were out of range and deleted. They ranged from 99.4 to 
1827.3

No DO data 10/1 000 to 10/13 1230. Out of range due to membrane puncture caused 
by a crab in the sonde guard.

Salinity drops 10/9 - 10/13. Possibly due to end of deployment fouling. Data is 
questionable but was retained. 

Low salinity on 10/15 caused by heavy rain that day. Low salinity 10/27 - 10/31 
due to heavy rainfall on 10/27 and 10/29.


November
343 negative turbidity values were deleted.

No turbidity 11/21 500 137.8

Low salinity on 11/1, 11/8 - 11/9 due to rain.

No data 11/7 1030. Instrument swapped for new deployment.

No data 11/25 1330 - 11/30 2330 Instrument removed for the winter.


12. Missing Data:
All missing data is noted with a period (.). Periods were later removed for data
dissemination purposes and left blank.  Data are missing due to equipment 
failure, probe failure, fouling, or maintenance/calibration of equipment. For 
more details on the deleted data, see the Data Anomalies Section. To find out 
more details about missing data, please contact the research technician at the 
Great Bay site.
