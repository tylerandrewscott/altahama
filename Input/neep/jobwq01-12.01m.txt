2. Entry verification:
 	After retrieving and carefully cleaning the dataloggers, they are examined 
to detect any structural damage to the body or to the probes. The DO membrane is 
checked for ruptures and then replaced if needed. The turbidity probe is 
examined to assure that no obstruction affects the wiper and that the sensor is 
clean. Manipulation and observations are registered in the field log for each 
deployment respectively.
	The YSI is connected to a Pentium II 400 MHz IBM compatible computer and 
the data is reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowatch for Windows that 
accompanies the YSI 6000 datalogger. The file is uploaded in two formats, one in 
YSI PC6000 format and the other in Comma and "Delimited format then the file is 
renamed to have a ".txt" extension. The YSI Ecowatch for Windows program is used 
to plot the data and delete the pre- and post deployment data that are not in 
range of the other readings. The program is used to perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.). Data is initially reviewed using 
the Ecowatch graphing tool. Data for a month is compiled into one single 
Excel 2000 data sheet for further examination to detect gross outliers, and data 
recorded during instrument retrieval or caused by instrument failure. 
	Missing dates and times are checked before submitting the data to the 
Central Data Management Office. CDMO Excel macros are provided to assist in data 
reviewing and data editing. Data is opened with this program and empty or 
unrecorded data spaces are filled with periods. Columns are corrected for 
Specific format (correct data size and number of decimal place holders are 
specified by the NERR CDMO). Data and time readings are also checked. This 
program also identifies outliers. Outliers file is saved and printed for 
revision of each file. Missing data and explanatory reasons are recorded in the 
Anomalous data section. 
	Data that is found to be out of the instrument range or normal parameters 
for each sampling station is removed from the file and a period is inserted into 
the cell(s). Explanations for changes in data are also included in the metadata. 
Data that is outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site 
is investigated for validity based on field observation, QC check, Ecowatch for 
Windows printouts, and the instrument diagnostics. The metadata form is 
submitted with the data to the CDMO. Data is stored in zip disks. Dr. Pedro 
Robles and Luis Encarnación were responsible for data management during this 
period. 
 
3. Research Objectives:
  	Two dataloggers are deployed at Mar Negro area, a major component of Jobos 
Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The instruments are suspended from a 
pole at a distance of 0.3 meter from the bottom at each selected site. Data from 
stations 9 and 10 is being submitted to the Central Data Management Office as 
part of the System-Wide Monitoring Program. Measurements are taken at thirty-
minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. The sites are identified as 
representative of areas within the reserve and comparable to the sites that may 
be receiving impact from human activities from surroundings areas.
	Station number nine (9), the impacted site, collects water quality data in 
a site associated with runoff from littoral and basin mangrove areas. This 
sampling station is closer to the Thermoelectric Power Plant it is subjected to 
runoff and potential oil spill contamination from this industrial facility. 
Information compiled from historical environmental documents, indicate that 
station nine (9) was used as a disposal site for residues of the previously 
operating sugar mill operation, and therefore might have high organic input into 
the sediments.
	Station number ten (10), located in the mangrove lagoon area is the 
reference or non-impacted site.

4.	Research methods:
 	The National Estuarine Research Reserve Water Quality Monitoring Program 
began sampling at Station nine (9) on December 20, 1995 and Station ten (10) on 
February 1, 1996. Long term water quality monitoring is being performmed at 
these stations.
         Before each YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer's instruction (YSI Manual 
addendum 7/94, sections 3, 4 and 7). Calibration standards are only required for 
pH, salinity, and turbidity, all other parameters are done as described in the 
manual. Buffer solutions for two-point calibration (pH 7 and pH 10) are 
purchased from a scientific supply company. Salinity is calibrated with a 
specific conductance standard 100 mS/cm and is purchased from a scientific 
supply company.
         The two-point turbidity calibration is performed using a 0 NTU (DI 
water) and 100 NTU standard purchased from a scientific company. The dissolved 
oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to Sit at least 
24 hours prior to deployment. Weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in 
the field observation log during deployment. Measurements of DO, pH, salinity, 
specific conductance, and temperature, are taken with other calibrated field 
instruments to check the accuracy of the instrumentation.
	Each YSI datalogger is tied with steel cable to a wrought iron galvanized 
pole, which is plunged into the sediments at each sampling area.  Dataloggers 
are suspended from a pole at 0.3 meter from the bottom of the selected site. 
Every 30 minutes during the sampling period the following measurements are 
recorded: date, time, temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved 
oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, pH, and turbidity. 
Every two weeks the dataloggers are retrieved, uploaded, cleaned, inspected, and 
calibrated as noted previously. The datalogger is then ready to be deployed 
again.

5. Site location and character:
 	The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JOBNERR) is located on 
the southern coastal plain of the island of Puerto Rico, a reserve within the 
West Indies geographical area. JOBNERR is composed of two major areas: (1) Mar 
Negro, located on the western margin of the Bay, and (2) Cayos Caribe, a chain 
of 15 tear-shaped islets located to the southeast. The Mar Negro area comprises 
the bulk of the Reserve, and consists of mangrove forests and a complex system 
of lagoons and channels interspersed with salt and mud flats.  Coral reefs and 
seagrass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas fringe Cayos Caribe 
mangrove islands.
 	Station 9 is an impacted site and is located on the northeastern section 
of the Mar Negro component. This sampling station is associated with mangrove 
lagoon areas and receives runoff from mudflats, the Thermoelectric Power Plant, 
and adjacent areas. The tidal range varies from 12 to 14 inches in the vicinity 
of the monitoring station. The salinity at the vicinity of the monitoring 
station varies from 0.0 ppt to 41.1 ppt. The average depth at station 09 is 1 
meter. The bottom is covered by a thick layer of thin sediments with a high 
content of organic material. Brown and green algae are also present at this 
site, but a better assessment is needed. The station pole is located at 17° 56' 
36.8" N and 66° 14' 18.5" W.
 	Station 10 is located in a mangrove lagoon not impacted directly by any 
upland or marine activities. It provides a reference for comparison of data 
obtained in other stations, especially to the station in Mar Negro lagoon.  The 
tidal range varies from 12 to 14 inches. The salinity at the vicinity of the 
monitoring station varies from 0.0 ppt to 41.7 ppt. The average depth at station 
10 is 1 meter. The bottom is covered with a layer of fine sediments with organic 
material, followed by a layer of calcareous material mainly from shells and 
oysters. At this site we can find seagrass ( Thalassia), calcareous algae 
( Halimeda sp.), green algae (Caulerpa sp.) and brown algae( Dictyota sp.) among 
others. The pole is located at 17° 56' 20.3" N and 66° 45' 26.7" W.
  	Data from stations 9 and 10 is being submitted to the CDMO. Four sondes 
are permanently devoted to taking readings from these two sites, to assure 
continuous readings while sondes are taken out of the water for data upload and 
maintenance. This will avoid data gaps for station 9 and 10 between sonde 
maintenance procedures. All monitoring is considered long term.
 
6. Data collection period: 
 	Station nine (9) sampling with the YSI began on December 20, 1995.
	Station ten (10) sampling with the YSI began on February 1, 1996.

Values not registered by sonde:

Suspicious pH values were deleted:
03/18/2001 10:30:00 throughout 03/27/2001 09:00:00
Deleted bad data due to sonde maintenance. Sonde was clearly still out of water 
when the sonde took reading:
03/18/01 10:00:00
Suspicious DO% and DO mg/l values retained:
03/15/01 00:00:00 through 22:00:00
It's a possibility this could be due to algae activity or other organism 
activity example (Cassiopeia) in the bottom of the sonde.

12. Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by any period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
Anomalous Data Section (11.) To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

B) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them. 

C) Both stations 9 and 10 are in shallow water, with an average depth of one 
meter. The sensor is about six inches off the bottom. This can cause high and 
low turbidity data due to organisms entering inside of the sensor area.
