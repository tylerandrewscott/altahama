2.  Entry verification:

The data are directly downloaded in the YSI-PC6000 format (as a .dat file) and 
the Comma & ³ ³ Delimited format (as a .csv file) from the dataloggers to an IBM 
compatible lap-top (Epson Equity LT-286e).  The data are reviewed using the 
PC6000 software.  Graphs and basic statistics are then generated with the PC6000 
program and the information is printed out for each data file.  These graphs are 
used to determine any obvious data outliers and sonde and/or probe malfunction.  
All downloaded data files from the dataloggers (both raw unedited .dat and .csv 
files) are then transferred via disk to a Power Mac 7100, where all files are 
reviewed and  formatted for CDMO and stored.  Here the raw unedited .csv data 
files are imported into Microsoft Excel 5.0.  After a complete month of data has 
been recorded, each file is ready to review which requires several steps.  The 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel macros are used for all data.  A data file is created 
(from the merged raw unedited .csv data files) in Excel format with a full month 
of data.  The first step is to make sure that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order, specified by the NERR CDMO.  If any parameters are not collected 
due to probe failure or other causes, the cells with this missing data are 
filled in with periods (.) and documented and explained in the appropriate 
section of the metadata.  Secondly, missing dates and times are inserted in the 
data file where data were not collected due to maintenance, sonde failure, etc., 
and the cells with this missing data are filled in with periods (.) and 
documented and explained in the appropriate section of the metadata.  The first 
NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel 5.0 macro is then run to determine if there are any 
missing dates and times; and if so these missing dates and times are inserted.  
Next, the second NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel 5.0 macro is used to find and filter all 
data readings outside the sonde specification measuring range for each 
parameter.  Here the ³outlier² data generated by the second macro are examined 
and determined as either explained or unexplained anomalies, as specified by 
NERR CDMO Operations Manual.  All anomalous data (explained and unexplained) are 
documented and explained in the appropriate sections of the metadata.  The 
explained anomalous data are then removed from the data file and replaced by 
periods.  The unexplained anomalous data are investigated for validity based on 
weather data, field observations, instrument diagnostics, and PC6000 printouts.  
If these data are rejected from the file then these are removed and replaced by 
periods.  Lastly, the third and final NERR CDMO QA/QC Excel 5.0 macro is used to 
reformat all the columns in the data file to the correct number of significant 
digits.  After this last step, once the file has been completely formatted and 
edited as specified by NERR CDMO, the file is saved as a Tab delimited (.txt) 
text file and sent by FTP to the CDMO.  The metadata form is also submitted with 
the data file to the CDMO.  Scott Orringer is responsible for this task of entry 
verification with the analyses of suspect and anomalous data.  Michele Dionne 
supervises, proofs and answers questions with the evaluation of suspect and 
anomalous data.


3.  Research objectives:

	The Webhannet River estuary is located in proximity to heavily used 
beaches in Wells, Maine.  It has a shoreline that is highly developed with 
residential and commercial structures.  The estuary receives water from a 14 sq. 
mi. watershed that is well forested.  We are measuring variations in hydrologic 
variables in the Webhannet River estuary at the head of tide and at the inlet.  
Data from head of tide will integrate surface and ground water inputs (from both 
point and non-point sources) from the freshwater watershed into the estuary.  
Data from the inlet will integrate surface and ground water inputs from the 
freshwater watershed and the estuarine watershed.  Differences in data between 
the head of tide and the inlet will indicate inputs from the estuarine portion 
of the watershed (on the ebb tide), and inputs from the Gulf of Maine on the 
flood tide.  The instruments will track runoff events via salinity, and will 
measure pollutant-carrying sediment particles via turbidity.  Our working 
hypothesis is that the freshwater watershed is the primary source of sediment 
and therefore potential NPS pollutants in the estuary.  These two variables will 
indicate the potential for non-point source pollutants to enter the estuary, and 
whether they are of upland, estuarine or Gulf of Maine origin.  Other variables 
measured by the data loggers (DO, temperature, pH, specific conductivity, and 
water level) will provide important baseline data to track changes in the 
estuary's physico-chemical parameters over the long term.  These variables can 
be affected by changes in human water use, and by natural or human induced 
changes in inlet and river channel morphology, climate, and organic loadings.  
The inlet site is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term 
monitoring site.  The head of tide site is relatively unimpacted, located just 
east of the Route One bridge, and is our ³roving² site.
	Efforts are underway to restore tidal flow in New England salt marshes 
that were negatively impacted by tidal restrictions (Burdick et. al. 1997).  The 
Wells NERR has been instrumental in identifying and measuring the damaging 
effects of tidal-restriction, due to roads and culverts, on salt marsh 
ecosystems.  The second area of monitoring is known as Drakes Island Marsh, a 
barrier island salt marsh in Wells, Maine, that was impounded with a road and 
culvert by farmers in the late 1800¹s.  The Wells NERR began monitoring the 
natural restoration of this degraded marsh in 1988 after a neglected flapper 
valve failed and partial restoration of tidal flow occurred.  Vegetation data 
including biomass and percent coverage and environmental data including 
salinity, water table, and tidal heights have been collected in several 
locations in the marsh since that time (Hoffman 1997).At the northern-most 
branch of the Webhannet River estuary in Drakes Island Marsh, two more data 
loggers have been deployed above (upstream) and below (downstream) a culvert in 
a road crossing that greatly restricts tidal flow.  We want to determine if 
tidal restriction does influence water quality of the tidally restricted 
(upstream) marsh acreage, since changes in hydrology are also considered to be a 
type of non-point source pollution.  The upstream site is the impacted or 
treatment site, and the downstream site is the control or reference site.


4.  Research Methods

	The Wells NERR YSI monitoring program began in April 1995 at one site and 
May 1995 at a second site in the Webhannet River estuary.  Two more sites were 
added in April 1996.  All four data loggers are installed with bottom moorings, 
as described below.  Each data logger was placed in a 4 inch diameter, 2 1/2 ft. 
long PVC pipe housing for protection.  Several holes were cut out near the 
bottom of the PVC pipe to allow water flow to the probes.  There are three 
stainless steel bolts drilled into each PVC housing to hold the data logger in 
place.  Two bolts near the top allow the YSI to hang by its bail and one bolt 
near the bottom is placed just under the sonde guard.  Each PVC housing uses an 
underwater float and a surface buoy  attached to the outer top bolt with 3 feet 
of rope.  This allows the top end of the data logger to float freely while the 
probe-end is fixed to the bottom mooring.  Before deployment, duct tape is used 
to keep bolt nuts secure and clean.  Both data loggers have 1/4 inch vector mesh 
placed on the outside (using rubber bands) and bottom (using cable ties) of the 
sonde guard to prevent fouling.
	The head of tide site (HT) uses a steel sign post (hammered about 1.5 ft) 
for a bottom mooring, and two stainless steel clips are used to secure the 
probe-end of the data logger 0.30 meters (1.0 ft) off the bottom.  One of these 
clips is attached to the sign post with a marine lock for security.  A 4-lb. 
dansforth anchor is also clipped to the probe-end of the data logger with 20 ft 
of rope for secondary security measures.  
	The inlet site (IN) uses a 50 lb. mushroom anchor as a bottom mooring, 
with 15 ft of rope slack clipped and tied to the pier.  The inlet site is 
secured at 1.0 meter (3.28  ft) off the bottom using a stainless steel link 
attached to the rope.  The probe-end of the data logger was attached to this 
link with stainless steel clips (the buoys attached to other end of the housing.
		The Drakes Island upstream site (UP) uses a steel sign post 
(hammered about 1.5 ft) for a bottom mooring, and two stainless steel clips are 
used to secure the probe-end of the data logger 0.30 meters (1.0 ft) off the 
bottom.  One of these clips is attached to the sign post with a marine lock for 
security.  A 4-lb. dansforth anchor is also clipped to the probe-end of the data 
logger with 20 ft of rope for secondary security measures.  
		The Drakes Island downstream site (DN) uses a steel sign post 
(hammered about 1.5 ft) for a bottom mooring, and two stainless steel clips are 
used to secure the probe-end of the data logger 0.23 meters (0.75 ft) off the 
bottom.  One of these clips is attached to the sign post with a marine lock for 
security.  A 4-lb. dansforth anchor is also clipped to the probe-end of the data 
logger with 20 ft of rope for secondary security measures.  
	Two to four week variable sampling periods were chosen due to limitations 
created by the life of the dissolved oxygen membrane and limited battery power.  
Measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and turbidity are recorded at 30 minute 
intervals throughout the deployment period.
	After the deployment period, the data loggers are brought back into the 
Wells Reserve Laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and calibration.  These 
procedures are carried out to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.  
Calibration standards are needed and used for only specific conductivity 
(10mS/cm), pH (buffer solutions of pH 4, 7, and 10), and turbidity (0.0 and 200 
NTU).  Conductivity and pH standards are purchased from Fisher Scientific.  
Turbidity standards are purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc. (Redwood 
City, CA).  The 200 NTU standard is diluted with distilled water to create 100 
NTU standard.  The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced and sit 6-24 hours 
before each deployment.  After approximately 6-24 hours of down time for 
cleaning, maintenance and recalibration, the YSI Data loggers are redeployed for 
another sampling period.  Also, with our extra data sonde, we have been reducing 
the amount of time of missing data from calibrations and maintenance.


5.  Site location and character    
	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York County, 
within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and faces the Atlantic 
Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 miles) south of Portland, 
Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, Massachusetts.  The Reserve 
encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of Maine coastline of tidally-flushed 
wetlands, riparian and transitional upland fields and forests within the Little 
River Estuary and the larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in 
the sandy glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers empty 
into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles along the 
Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river¹s inlet are double spit barrier beaches 
attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system is approximately 5 sq. km and 
is composed of large intertidal marshes (predominantly S. patens and S. 
alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed 
for the Webhannet River estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 
streams, brooks or creeks which enter the estuary.  These tributaries flow 
across sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the impermeable sandy 
muds of the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The Webhannet River is 
connected to the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a spring tidal prism of 
28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). The force and volume of tidal action affect the 
salinity level of both rivers.  In the Wells region, the annual mean wave height 
is almost 20 inches.  The estuarine system is dominated by semi-diurnal tides 
having a range of 8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into both 
estuaries is moderate to low (on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), 
especially in the summer, because of the rivers¹ relatively small drainage areas 
and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The relatively low flows from these 
two rivers taken in with the 20 inch per year average runoff of the area 
surrounding the estuaries combine to form a fresh water flow which is dwarfed by 
tidal flushing.  Twelve-foot tides dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet 
estuary, which has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet estuary, 
fed by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and greatly 
developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for comparison with the 
relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land use of the Webhannet estuary 
include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh water, and tidal marsh; a total of 
63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 18.6% for developed land (compared to a 
total of 5.7% development in the Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 
1997).
	There are four sampling sites in the Webhannet River estuary.  These are 
located at the head of tide and at the inlet, and two sites at the northern-most 
branch of the Webhannet River estuary in Drakes Island Marsh, above (upstream) 
and below (downstream) Drakes Island Road.  The tidal range at all of these 
sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.   
	The head of tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just 
downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 
deg 17¹ 00² Latitude, 70 deg 35¹ 30² Longitude).  Route One is used heavily with 
traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  This site has 
soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide depth is 
relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean of 3.6 
ppt.  These head waters of the Webhannet are relatively undeveloped. This site 
is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is our ³roving² site.
	The inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the 
Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19¹ 12² Latitude, 70 deg 33¹ 50² Longitude).  The 
mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an extensive wetland/salt marsh area which 
is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most recently dredged in 
1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing and recreational 
boats.  The mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the Atlantic Ocean.  
This channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a predominately sand substrate 
and is characterized by strong current during incoming and outgoing tides.  The 
salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean of 31 ppt.  The inlet site is 
heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term monitoring site.
	The second area of monitoring is known as Drakes Island Marsh, a barrier 
island salt marsh in Wells, Maine, that was impounded with a road and culvert by 
farmers in the late 1800¹s.  The Wells NERR began monitoring the natural 
restoration of this degraded marsh in 1988 after a neglected flapper valve 
failed and partial restoration of tidal flow occurred.  Salt intolerant 
vegetation was soon killed across 40 percent of the 40 hectare (upstream) site.  
Both sites are composed of large intertidal marshes (predominantly S. patens and 
S. alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud flats, and tidal channels.The marsh 
formed landward of a barrier beach system in a lagoon estuary.  Use of the 40 
hectare upstream marsh as a pasture led to hydrographic manipulations since 1848 
when a dike was built.  A road providing access to the Drakes Island beach and 
running parallel to the dike had a box culvert with a water control structure 
that operated from the 1920s to the 1950s.  Another beach access road was built 
at the north end of the marsh, preventing spring tides entering the marsh from 
the Little River estuary.  The sedimentary record indicates that the impacted 
area (upstream) was originally dominated by high marsh, and was similar to the 
adjacent salt marsh found downstream (reference area) of the road today (Burdick 
et. al. 1997).Drakes Island Marsh is located at the northern-most branch of the 
Webhannet River estuary, and the data loggers have been deployed above 
(upstream) and below (downstream) this 1.2 meter diameter culvert in Drakes 
Island road that greatly restricts tidal flow.  Both sites are located 1.0 miles 
south of the Wells NERR.  The upstream site is 43 deg 19¹ 50² Latitude, 70 deg 
33¹ 25² Longitude, with the salinity range 9-35 ppt, with a mean of 30 ppt.  The 
downstream site is 43 deg 19¹ 45² Latitude, 70 deg 33¹ 45² Longitude, with the 
salinity range 5-35 ppt, with a mean of 29 ppt.   


6.  Data collection period:

	The Webhannet River head of tide (HT) site data collection was re-deployed 
(after being pulled in December 1995) on April 12 17:00, and pulled December 16, 
9:30 for the winter months to prevent ice damage.  This site gets a large amount 
of ice coverage from December through late March.
	The Webhannet River inlet (IN) site data collection began May 29, 1995, 
13:00.  The IN datalogger is ongoing throughout the year and is considered our 
long-term monitoring site, as this site remains relatively 
ice-free.
	The Drakes Island upstream impacted site (UP) data collection began April 
23, 11:00, and was pulled December 16, 10:00, for the winter months to prevent 
ice damage.  This site gets a large amount of ice coverage from December through 
late March.
	The Drakes Island downstream control site (DN) data collection began April 
23, 11:00, and was pulled December 16, 9:30:00, for the winter months to prevent 
ice damage.  This site gets a large amount of ice coverage from December through 
late March.

	We began measuring turbidity as soon as the data loggers were upgraded at 
YSI.  The first turbidity measurement was taken at the inlet (IN) site on 
February 16, 1996 at 12:30, and has been ongoing; and began with the HT, UP, and 
DN data loggers since their first 1996 deployment in 
April.


7.  Associated researchers and projects

	Ongoing research at the Wells Reserve is designed to address issues of 
concern to the Gulf of Maine management community; sea level rise, beach 
erosion, coastal water quality and nutrient enrichment, coastal habitat value, 
habitat restoration of shellfish and finfish, marsh plant community dynamics, 
and plant-soil-nutrient relationships.  Active research 
topics include:
	€ rates of accretion of salt marsh peat
	€ hydrologic and ecological response of impounded marshes to restoration
	€ assessment of shellfish resources in the Webhannet River flats
	€ assessment of resident and migratory fish use of Little River estuary
	€ use of large wading birds as indicators of salt marsh habitat health
	€ watershed nutrient loading to Little and Webhannet River estuaries
	€ linkage between estuarine nutrient enrichment and oxygen dynamics 
throughout coastal 
	Maine
	€ climatic versus competitive control of salt marsh plant communities
	€ effects of climate on salt marsh plant phenology and phenotype
	€ associations between marsh plant distribution, soil nutrients, and soil 
type

Although many of these projects are ongoing some of the findings to date are:
€ Impounded salt marshes can respond quickly to restored tidal flow, with early 
colonization by salt marsh vegetation and by resident and migratory marsh 
fishes.	
€ Seed clam density declines with distance from the Webhannet River inlet, 
indicating an external as opposed to an internal source of recruitment to the 
clam population.  There is a small but significant relationship between density 
and sediment organic matter.
€ Juvenile striped bass utilize the Little River estuary as a food resource; 
diet analysis indicates a preference for sand shrimp.
€ The Reserve¹s estuaries appear to be nitrogen limited; primary nitrogen source 
is ocean water.  Nutrients from fresh surface 	water influence nutrient 
concentrations in the upper estuary.  Ground water may be a significant source 
of nitrogen in the upper Webhannet River estuary.
€ Maine¹s estuaries and embayments show no serious oxygen depletion, with a few 
exceptions.  Dissolved oxygen and nitrogen levels are related to freshwater 
runoff, indicating that activities in the watershed can influence the estuaries 
even in the face of the high tidal flushing rates typical of Maine¹s estuaries.
€ Salt marsh plant phenology varies significantly between Wells NERR and 
Prudence Island NERR;  trends suggest possible genetic variation within species.
€ Soil nitrogen concentrations are directly related to forbe distribution on the 
Reserve¹s salt marshes.


	The Research Program¹s volunteer water quality monitoring program (W.E.T.) 
has been monitoring fecal coliform contamination and other water quality 
parameters in the estuaries since 1991.  W.E.T. (Watershed Evaluation Team) was 
established to characterize and monitor the aquatic environment of the Little 
and Webhannet River estuaries.  This program allows students from local schools 
and volunteers to participate in ³hands-on² scientific research and management 
activities at the Reserve.  Information yielded by this effort is valuable as 
baseline data for research conducted at the Reserve and may help in guiding 
current management priorities.  Reserve staff with W.E.T. volunteers and 
students, working with the Town of Wells and the Maine Department of Marine 
Resources (DMR), have recently opened selected shellfish beds in the Webhannet 
River after seven years of closure.  This was a direct result of monitoring 
fecal coliform contamination (and other water quality parameters), which is the 
major source of non-point source pollution in southern Maine.  W.E.T. is part of 
a National Monitoring Program called Estuary-Net.  This program allows students 
to share their data and compare their results with other monitoring groups via 
the web.
	University of New Hampshire researchers completed a year long monitoring 
project measuring the volume, nutrient concentrations, and total suspended 
solids of freshwater discharge into the Webhannet River estuary, relating these 
inputs to precipitation, and measuring their effects on estuarine water quality; 
using a hydrolab.  Research staff and students have completed a four year study 
of hydrology and vegetation of a degraded Webhannet River marsh recovering from 
roadway impoundment after restoration of tidal flow.  In June of 1994, Reserve 
research staff and students completed an 18 month survey of larval fish 
distribution and abundance in the Wells Reserve¹s estuaries and in the near-
shore waters of Wells Bay. University of New Hampshire researchers are working 
with eelgrass beds in Wells Embayment to develop criteria for siting and 
evaluating eel grass restoration projects.  Both salt marsh and eelgrass are 
thought to be important habitats for many Gulf of Maine fishes. University of 
Maine Machias is collaborating with Reserve staff to determine the status of the 
soft-shell clam resource in the Reserve¹s estuaries.  Reserve staff are working 
with the Maine Dept. of Environmental Protection to survey the dissolved oxygen 
status of 25 estuaries throughout Maine, using data sondes to measure oxygen 
depletion as an indicator of non-point source pollution (Coastal Hypoxia Study).

April, 1996 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No data on 4/1 0:00 to 4/12 16:30; this was the first logger deployment (4/12 at 
17:00) at this site.
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 25 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
	4/13 10:00, 13:00, 14:30, 16:00, 17:30, 19:00-21:00, 22:00-23:00
	4/15 9:00-10:30, 11:30, 13:00-13:30, 17:00-18:30, 19:30
No turbidity data from 4/16 9:30 through 4/30 23:30:00 due to turbidity probe 
malfunction.  There was a turbidity probe wiper malfunction (the wiper was 
parked over the optics), and seawater leaked into the turbidity probe aux port.  
There was a large drop of normal readings to 665 high negative values (range -
719.3 to -739.4).  These anomalous readings were due to a turbidity probe 
failure and these data were deleted.  The turbidity probe was sent back and 
replaced by YSI.
DO deleted from 4/12 17:00 to 23:30; first few records are high and appears that 
the membrane may have still been settling.  
Inlet:
No turbidity data from 4/12 17:00 to 4/25 10:00 because of turbidity probe wiper 
malfunction.  After logger retrieval, the wiper was observed parked on the 
optics.  The probe did malfunction and needed to be replaced at YSI.  These data 
were deleted.
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 79 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.
	4/25 13:30-20:00, 22:00-23:00

Drakes Island Upstream:
No data on 4/1 0:00 to 4/23 10:30; this was the first logger deployment (4/23 at 
11:00) at this site.
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 128 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.

	4/30 0:00-23:30
There are suspect turbidity data from 4/23 11:00 (190.7) to 4/29 06:30 (129.3) 
(280 values with a mean of 67.4; including small negative turbidity values), 
where turbidity values increased sharply and decreased sharply to small negative 
values.  These data are suspect not only due to this unusual range of high 
values.  The data also alternated (within the above range of dates and times) to 
a high positive value and then immediately decreased to a small negative value 
the next reading (a half an hour later).  The value then returned to a high 
positive value on the next reading (a half an hour later), and continued.  For 
example, the turbidity values from 4/28 21:30 to 23:00, at every 30 minutes, 
were: 284.3, - 2.2, 291.9, -3.4.  This could be from probe malfunction, but the 
data trailed off to small negative values by the end of the month.   
These data were not deleted.
Drakes Island Downstream:
No data on 4/1 0:00 to 4/23 10:30; this was the first logger deployment (4/23 at 
11:00) at this site.
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 102 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.

	4/29 6:00-10:30, 18:30-22:30
	4/30 8:30-11:00, 19:30-23:30
There are suspect dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 4/23 11:00 
through 4/30 23:30 due to a very gradual decrease of values.  All DOmg and DOsat 
data, after a certain point, decreased steadily while fluctuating until reaching 
values of 7.4 and 70.8, respectively.  These data were not deleted, however, 
since values did not decrease too low (i.e. negative values).  These data 
continued to decrease gradually while fluctuating until the next calibration 
(5/9 13:30).  

May, 1996 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No turbidity data from 5/1 0:00 through 5/9 8:00 due to turbidity probe 
malfunction (continuation from 4/30/96).  There was a turbidity probe wiper 
malfunction (the wiper was parked over the optics), and seawater leaked into the 
turbidity probe aux port.  There was a large drop of normal readings to 401 high 
negative values (range -725.4 to ­740.2).  These anomalous readings were due to 
a turbidity probe failure and these data were deleted.  The turbidity probe was 
sent back and replaced by YSI.
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 107 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not

There was one high positive turbidity spike on 5/26 15:00 of 67.0 NTU; it is not 
consistent with the overall data record.  This suspect datum was not deleted, as 
we are not absolutely sure that this value is bad.
There is possible suspect percent saturation and dissolved oxygen data from 5/8 
9:30 to 5/9 12:00.  Percent saturation and dissolved oxygen data increased from 
values of 88.3 and 8.5, respectively, on 5/8 9:00 to values of 133.3 and 12.8, 
respectively, on 5/8 9:30.  From 5/1 0:00 to 5/8 9:00, the percent 
saturation and dissolved oxygen data had average values of 92.7 and 8.9, 
respectively (355 values each).  
From 5/8 9:30 to 5/9 12:00 (last data value before calibration), the percent 
saturation and dissolved oxygen data had average values of 133.1 and 12.3, 
respectively (54 values each).  These data are possibly suspect because after 
5/8 9:00 these data remained at these increased values.  The data were not 
deleted.
Drakes Island Downstream:
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 129 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.

	5/8 0:30-5:00, 13:30-17:30
	5/9 1:00-6:00
No turbidity data were collected from 5/13 14:30 to 5/31 23:30 due to a 
turbidity probe malfunction.  This probe had to be replaced by YSI.
There are suspect dissolved oxygen and percent saturation data from 5/1 0:00 
through 5/9 13:00 due to a very gradual decrease of values.  All DOmg and DOsat 
data, after a certain point, decreased steadily while fluctuating until reaching 
values of 5.9 and 60.3, respectively, on 5/5 7:30.  These data were not deleted, 
however, since values did not decrease too low (i.e. negative values).  
These data continued to decrease gradually while fluctuating until the next 
calibration (5/9 13:30).  This was a continuation from 4/23 11:00.

we are not absolutely sure that this value is bad.
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 6/6 09:30 through 7/1

Drakes Island Upstream:
No data on 6/4 13:30 to 18:00 and 6/5 0:00 to 6/7 14:30 due to a battery crash; 
and due to downtime for calibration, maintenance and downloading.  The logger 
stopped recording during these times (finally stopped for good on 6/5 0:00), 
although there was a small amount of data recorded between 6/4 18:30 to 
23:30.  The battery voltage decreased to 6.0 volts at this time.
Drakes Island Downstream:
No turbidity data were collected from 6/1 0:00 to 6/7 9:30 due to a turbidity 
probe malfunction.  This probe had to be replaced by YSI (this was a 
continuation from 5/13 14:30).
There were two high positive turbidity spikes on 6/22 21:00 (240.2) and 21:30 
(252.0) that were not consistent with the overall data record.  These suspect 
data were not deleted, as we are not absolutely sure that these values were bad.
There are suspect pH data from 6/11 17:00 to 6/30 23:30, where pH values dropped 
sharply to 6.6 (from 7.9 on 6/11 16:30) and then gradually decreased to values 
fluctuating between 5.9-6.3.  These data were not deleted.  The post-calibration 
readings were acceptable.

July, 1996 Sampling Period
Head of Tide:
No dissolved oxygen data or percent saturation data from 6/6 09:30 through 7/1 
11:00 due to a suspected DO membrane puncture.  All DOmg and DOsat data, after a 
certain point, decreased steadily until reaching values of 0.0 followed by 
negative values.  These data were suspect and deleted.
The following were small negative turbidity values (logging period recorded 396 
anomalies), possibly due to a small calibration error.  These data were not 
deleted.

There are suspect pH data from 7/13 20:00 to 7/18 1:30, where pH values dropped 
sharply to 4.9 and then gradually increased back to normal values.  These data 
were not deleted.  The post-calibration readings were acceptable.
There are suspect turbidity data from 7/13 15:30 to 7/15 12:30, where turbidity 
values increased sharply to a high value of 138.5 and dropped back to normal 
values.  These data were not deleted.  However, there was a large storm when 
logger was deployed on 7/1 which could have been the cause.
Inlet:

No turbidity data collected from 12/1 0:00 to 12/16 10:00.  We had a 
malfunctioning probe that was sent back to YSI for repair; did not have a probe 
available for this deployment (this was a continuation from 10/25 17:00 and all 
through November).
No data from 12/16 10:30 to 12/31 23:30.  This datalogger was pulled for the 
year (winter months) to prevent ice damage.
Drakes Island Downstream:
No data from 12/16 10:00 to 12/31 23:30.  This datalogger was pulled for the 
year (winter months) to prevent ice damage.



12.  Other Remarks/Notes:

	-We began measuring turbidity as soon as the data loggers were upgraded at 
YSI.  The first turbidity measurement was taken at the inlet (IN) site on 
February 16, 1996 at 12:30, and has been ongoing; and began with the HT, UP, and 
DN data loggers since their first 1996 deployment in April.

	-Turbidity values for the inlet (IN) logger from 10/22 14:00 to 10/31 
23:30 were higher than usual for this length of time (3,868 readings with a 
range of 88.9 NTU decreasing gradually to 1.2 NTU, mean of 8.5 NTU).  This was 
probably due to a large storm hitting the northeast coast (10/19-10/22), where 
the town 15 miles north of Wells (Biddeford) received approximately 18 inches of 
rain. These data were not deleted.

	-In October the Head of Tide (HT), Drakes Island Upstream (UP), and Drakes 
Island Downstream (DN) loggers were all unretrievable because of the extreme 
high tide, due to a large storm hitting the northeast coast (10/19-10/22), where 
the town 15 miles north of Wells (Biddeford) received approximately 18 inches of 
rain.  The batteries for all sondes crashed and was unable to retrieve these 
sondes, until after the storm.
