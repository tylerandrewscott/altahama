2. Entry Verification:

Data are uploaded to the PC from the Data loggers and graphs are produced using 
EcoWatch software.  Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from 
probe failure.  Notes are made of any unusual data, and sensors are 
reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .csv files using 
EcoWatch software.  The .csv files are imported into EXCEL, edited by removing 
headers and footers, and saved as EXCEL files.  Data at the beginning and end of 
each data record that were recorded when the instruments were out of the water 
are deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document the times 
in and out of the water, and by unusual depth data (usually negative or near 
zero).  The appropriate files are merged to form complete monthly data sets and 
are saved as separate EXCEL files.  Data that are missing because the 
instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are denoted by 
periods (.).  These times are noted in section 11 of this document. Two types of 
post-calibration values are also used to determine operational viability of the 
sensors while deployed.  One is obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes 
in standard solutions and recording the values given by the Data loggers.  The 
second type is obtained in the field using a newly calibrated Data logger 
(referred to as a control sonde).  Data from this instrument are recorded in the 
field at the time of the last scheduled reading by the deployed Data loggers.  
Both post-calibration values are reported in section 13 of this document, and 
may be used to determine the quality of the data recorded by the instruments 
(particularly DO) after two weeks in the field.  Any erroneous data that are 
identified as being caused by probe failures (as determined upon examination of 
the data plots, or by post-calibration values) are deleted and replaced with 
periods, and noted in section 11 of this document.  Sensor readings that greatly 
deviate from known values of standards after the two week deployment are not 
necessarily believed to be a result of probe failure, however.  If biofouling is 
believed to be the reason for poor agreement between the sensors and the 
standard values at the end of a deployment, the data are retained and noted in 
section 11 of this document.  Symptoms of probe failures are extreme noise in 
the record, unrealistically high or negative data, or noisy or negative readings 
in standard solutions.  Examples of many such failures are given in the CDMO 
Manual (Version 3.0). Finally, the CDMO macros (update version 11/96) are used. 
The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macros allow the user to automatically format column 
widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications. It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated file 
for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with periods, 
and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data logger is 
designed to measure (outliers). Scott Phipps was responsible for all data 
management.

3. Research Objectives/Study Purpose:

The Data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 
minutes.  Presently, two instruments are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve.  One 
is located at the mouth of Fish River (provides ~73% of Weeks Bay's freshwater), 
and the other is located on the eastern side of Weeks Bay, near the mouth.

Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon Secour 
Bay.  Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show that 
bottom waters (which flow into Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic in 
summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also in question, as 
largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during 
periods of high flow in the river.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if 
poor water quality periodically observed in Weeks Bay is generated within the 
bay proper, or is being introduced from Fish River or Bon Secour Bay with 
changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these 
two sites may be used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.  

There is a great deal of value in having a baseline data set for any management 
site.  Changes or trends in any monitored parameters are readily apparent.  
Weeks Bay is useful as a model for estuary function and this data is necessary 
for the profile of the model. 

4. Research Methods:

Data loggers are moored on private docks.  At each dock, a PVC tube is attached 
to a piling at the end of the dock using ratchets equipped with zinc disks (to 
help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A chain, attached to the cap of the 
tube, is shackled to the bail of the Data logger.  Chains and tubes were cut to 
a length that places the Data logger probes just below the bottom of the tube 
and 0.5 m above the sediment when in place.  A nylon rope tied to the bottom of 
the piling also runs through the tube and is attached to the bale of the data 
logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the data loggers in the event 
that the tube breaks away from the piling.

The data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation and concentration, pH, water 
level and turbidity every 30 minutes central standard time (CST).  When 
available, a newly calibrated data logger is also used to record the above 
parameters at the same time the deployed data logger takes its first reading to 
insure its initial accuracy.  The instruments are usually serviced (instruments 
post-calibrated, data uploaded, instruments cleaned and re-calibrated) every 14 
days; however, they are programmed to log for 30 days in the event they cannot 
be serviced on schedule.  Just before deployment, window screening (1mm mesh 
size) is wrapped once around the cage that protects the sensors, and secured 
with plastic electrical tape.  Window screening is also secured in the bottom of 
the cage with silicone sealant.  This is done to reduce error in the data that 
may be due to larger animals moving in and out of the cage during the 
deployment.  This does not, however, preclude smaller animals such as barnacle 
and polychaete larvae from entering the cage and settling on the sensors.

Before the data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated data logger (when 
available) is lowered to the depth of the deployed instrument, and readings are 
logged at the same time that the deployed instruments are programmed to record.  
Post-calibration values are obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in 
standard solutions and recording the values given by the data loggers.

Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as described in 
the YSI Operating Manual.  Calibration standards, required for pH, turbidity and 
salinity, are purchased from a scientific supply house.  Dissolved oxygen is 
calibrated using a calibration cup filled with about 1/2 cm tap water, which 
creates a 100% water-saturated air environment for the sensors when the sonde is 
placed in the cup.  The sensors are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 
minutes in the cup before DO (%Saturation) is calibrated.  

Servicing the instruments may result in a period of about 3 to 4 hours of 
missing data every two weeks at each site. When sufficient numbers of data 
loggers in good working order are available, newly calibrated sondes are swapped 
with sondes at the end of their deployments so that no data points are missed. 
In this case a control sonde, the new deployment sonde and the old deployment 
sonde all log at the same time at the same depth (ie. first log, last log and 
control) for QA/QC comparison.  

5. Site Location and Character:

Weeks Bay (30 23' N, 87 50' W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, 
located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It 
is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) runs nearly 
north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to the mouth, where 
water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near 
the center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side 
of Weeks Bay.  Average depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths 
are significantly greater.  The first is in the mouth of the bay, where the 
average depth is 6 m; the second is about 100 m upstream of the mouth of the 
Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally diurnal, 
and have a mean range of 0.4 m. 

The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 14300 hectares and contributes 
approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow with the Magnolia River 
supplying the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 cubic meters per second; 
although freshets up to 4 times larger occur throughout the year.  These 
characteristics result in a freshwater residence time of 13 days under average 
discharge conditions, with a range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay 
varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  During periods of high flow 
in the river, salinity in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, 
except in the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  
However, during periods of low flow in the river, wind velocity and tidal stage 
are strong factors influencing salinity structure.  Salinity greater than 25 ppt 
is rarely observed in Weeks Bay and is usually restricted to the southern 
portion of the estuary near the mouth.

Site FR (Fish River; 30 24.97'N, 87 49.37'W) is located near the mouth of Fish 
River at a mean depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there are 
small patches of Vallisneria sp. growing near (but not directly under) the data 
logger.  Land use in the water shed is agricultural, forested and residential 
with the residential portion rapidly increasing.  Directly surrounding the site, 
land use is residential and forested.  Nutrient concentrations at this site are 
variable and may be quite high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations 
ranging from approximately 4-100 然 and <0.5 to 7.5 然, respectively, over the 
previous 10 years (Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Geological 
Survey of Alabama).  Over the past year, salinity ranged from 0 to 25 ppt at 
this site.

Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 22.85' N, 87 49.92' W) is located near the south-east 
shore of Weeks Bay, about 0.5 kilometers from the mouth of the estuary.  Mean 
water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land use 
around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture occurring 
inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at site FR; 
over the previous 10  years, nitrate and phosphate concentrations here ranged 
from approximately 0.1 to 50 然 and 0.04 to 0.45 然, respectively.  Salinity 
ranged from approximately 5 to 25 ppt over the past year.

11. Data Anomalies:

General Information:

We have deleted data only when technical difficulties resulted in questionable 
data.  Therefore, we feel that extreme caution should be used when evaluating 
these data (especially DO % sat. and concentration) because of problems with 
biofouling.  Particularly during the summer months, biofouling can cause severe 
degradation of the DO calibration over the two-week deployments.  At times the 
DO deviation from calibration at the end of a deployment was greater than 80% 
(in a water-saturated air environment).  We have made note of any data that we 
consider suspect because of biofouling, based on post-calibration values 
reported by the sensors.  The year 2000 was a year of severe drought in the 
Weeks Bay watershed. This drought resulted in higher than normal salinity at 
both data logger sites and this, coupled with record breaking heat, resulted in 
greater than normal levels of biofouling. This increase in biofouling especially 
impacted dissolved oxygen measurements. Therefore all DO data following the 
first 2 - 4 days after initial deployment should be viewed as at least somewhat 
degraded (in some cases severely degraded). We also have provided the data that 
were taken in the field at the time of the final logging interval before 
retrieval of the deployed Data loggers, as well as the post-calibration values 
(for details see section 4, above) in section 13 below.  We encourage anyone 
using these data to first compare them to the discrete data logger readings and 
post-calibration values on the given dates before evaluating the data.  If the 
user desires, it is possible to use these data to correct the deployed YSI data 
using regression analysis.  If not, then the user should delete compromised data 
at his or her discretion.

Specific information: 

January 2000: 
At site FR, 
1/10/00 at 0630, Missing turbidity point, high spike probably due to detritus at 
sensor.
1/12/00 at 1730, DO went suddenly negative, reason unknown, probable failure of 
probe membrane, all DO data for the rest of this deployment were deleted (to 
1/19/00, 0830).
1/19/00, 0900-1130, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between 
deployments.
At site WB, 
1/19/00 - 2/3/00, DO readings 70% below ambient by end of deployment, heavy 
biofouling, barnacles, data left in the record.
No Turbidity data at site WB for the entire month of January, no probe deployed.
 
February 2000:
At site FR,
2/3/00 1300 - 2/17/00 0900, DO erratic but the post-calibration appears correct 
so data were left in the record. Salinity and Sp Cond. were somewhat depressed 
upon post-calibration, reason unknown, data also left in the record.
2/17/00 1230 - 2/29/00 1200, DO degraded by the end of this deployment due to 
biofouling, data left in the record.
2/3/00, 0930-1230, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between 
deployments.
2/17/00, 0930-1200, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between 
deployments.
2/29/00, 1230-1530, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between 
deployments.
At site WB,
2/3/00 - 2/17/00, DO response much reduced by the end of this deployment due to 
heavy biofouling, barnacles, data left in the record.
2/5/00 0800 - 1030, No Data, probes out of the water due to low winter tide 
coupled with strong wind causing low water levels. 
2/17/00 - 2/29/00, DO values were very high (supersaturated) during this 
deployment but post-calibration indicated that the probe was accurate, data left 
in the record.
No Turbidity data at site WB for the entire month of February, no probe 
deployed. 
 
March 2000:
At site FR,
3/20/00, 2230 - 3/23/00, 1200, No data, battery failure.
3/30/00, 0930 - 4/2/00, 0830, No data, sonde apparently lodged in the deployment 
tube due to biofouling inside the tube and then dropped down to normal 
deployment at 4/2/00, 0900. All data prior to this were deleted because it would 
have been from non-moving water inside the pipe. 
At site WB,
2/29/00 - 3/7/00, Very erratic DO data, highly supersaturated (see February 
deployment 2/17/00 - 2/29/00). It is apparent that this was a supersaturation 
event but real values may be inaccurate. It is important to note that during 
supersaturation of DO, there is a great deal of spatial variation in surface 
water and real values may fluctuate wildly. This site is essentially surface 
water during the winter months due to low winter tides.
3/7/00, 0400 - 3/23/00, 0900, No data, battery failure.
3/30/00, 1130, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between deployments.
No Turbidity data at site WB for the entire month of March, no probe deployed.

April 2000:
At site FR,
3/30/00, 0930 - 4/2/00, 0830, No data, sonde apparently lodged in the deployment 
tube due to biofouling inside the tube and then dropped down to normal 
deployment at 4/2/00, 0900. All data prior to this were deleted because it would 
have been from non-moving water inside the pipe. 
3/30/00 - 4/6/00, DO degraded by the end of the deployment (4/2/00 0900 - 4/6/00 
0930) due to biofouling, data left in the record.

deployments.
4/19/00, 0830 - 1200, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between 
deployments.
4/28/00, 0830 -0900, No data, sonde maintenance, re-calibration, between 
deployments.
At site WB,
3/30/00 - 4/6/00, pH probe had slow response on post-calibration, however, 
deployment data appears to be accurate, data left in the record.
4/28/00 - 5/4/00, DO appears higher than normal, post-calibration of probe read 
15% higher than actual, but periodicity remains accurate, data left in the 
record.

fluctuated wildly for the remainder of the deployment. Damaged membrane 
suspected, all DO values deleted.

May 2000:
At site FR,
5/4/00, 0030, Turbidity point deleted, high spike, probably detritus.

deployments.
5/18/00 1200 - 5/19/00 2230, No depth data, depth sensor did not respond during 
first 10.5 hours of deployment, then seemed to respond normally. This lack of 
response was then duplicated several times under controlled circumstances, 
indicating a possible problem with the sensor. The rest of the deployment depth 
data was left in the record but should be viewed with skepticism although it 
appears accurate when compared with data from the other site.
At site WB,
5/18/00 - 6/1/00, Very heavy biofouling, all data, especially DO were degraded 
by the end of this deployment. Data were left in the record.

October 2000:
At site FR,
9/29/00 - 10/20/00, Malfunctioning DO probe caused deletion of data following 
failure at 10/4/00, 0300 (see below). DO data prior to that time were left in 
the record, data appear to be accurate but may be viewed with skepticism.

12. Missing Data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post). For more details on deleted data, see 
section 11, Data Anomalies. To find out more details about missing data, contact 
the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks/Notes:

The year 2000 was the driest in 50 years and the hottest on record for the Weeks 
Bay watershed. Typically, the Bay is nearly freshwater for a portion of the 
year, but this did not happen in 2000. The Fish and Magnolia Rivers are deeper 
than Weeks Bay and this, combined with the low flow from the rivers caused by 
the drought caused an influx of seawater up the rivers. During midsummer, there 
was measurable salinity in 3/4 of the watershed. Most of the rivers volume was 
in the range of 15 - 20 ppt salinity. The deep parts of the rivers were 
essentially non-flowing and became anoxic as temperatures rose. The rain that 
did fall failed to flush out the deep portions of the rivers and simply flowed 
over this hypoxic/anoxic saline water. These conditions were less apparent at 
the data logger sites where the Bay is shallow and benthic algae somewhat 
ameliorate the oxygen problem.
