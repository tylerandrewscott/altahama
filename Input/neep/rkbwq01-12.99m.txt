2. Entry verification.
	The data contained herein were directly downloaded from the YSI 6000 data 
sonde to the PC6000 software on a DOS-based 486 computer.  The data were graphed 
and printed using the PC6000 software and then exported to Microsoft Excel.  
Charting and plotting routines within PC6000 and Excel were used to verify the 
accuracy of the data.  In addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros provided by the CDMO 
were used to format and check the dataset for outliers beyond what the probes 
measure.  Outliers and erroneous data were checked manually using the protocol 
defined in Appendix B of CDMO Operations Manual (v. 3.0).  Heather Stoffel was 
responsible for all data management.  

3. Research objectives.
	Henderson Creek, the system site #1 is located, is Rookery Bay's principal 
water conduit feeding the estuary.  Most of the Henderson Creek system is under 
public ownership, though historically much of its watershed was privately owned 
and developed.  Additional components include a water control structure 
maintained by the South Florida Water Management District.  The structure is a 
gated arcflow spillway with a vertical sluice gate and flap gate.  There are two 
additional gated weirs on the east and west-side ditches downstream of the main 
weir. This structure prevents salt water intrusion and controls the water level  
to prevent  continuous drainage for the Henderson Creek basin. Consequently, 
Henderson Creek represents an altered system and serves as a management model 
for water control issues in southwest Florida.  Altered timing and quality of 
freshwater has the potential to disrupt the biological processes of the Rookery 
Bay estuarine system.  The long term water quality monitoring began in early 
November 1996. Site  # 1 is located high within the estuary where salinities 
fluctuate drastically through tidal, seasonal, and management influences. In 
contrast to the Henderson Creek system, the Blackwater River system is a 
relatively undisturbed system. The Blackwater River watershed is primarily under 
state ownership with lessor amounts of agricultural influences.  The objective 
of moving the second site to the Blackwater River system is to compare an 
altered estuarine system (Henderson Creek) with a relatively undisturbed 
estuarine system (Blackwater River).  The second site was established in late 
February 1998 in the upper portion of the river (to be comparable to site # 1) 
and will remain the second site until February 2000.	These water quality 
stations are providing essential information to guide restoration efforts.  
Grant funding through NMFS has been obtained to retrofit the Henderson Creek 
weir.  Water releases strategies based on the water quality information will be 
implemented to allow for a more natural freshwater inflow pattern.

4. Research methods.
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific 
conductivity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen following the procedures outlined 
in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  A two point calibration is used for pH 
(Fisher buffers 7& 10) and turbidity (0 & 100 NTU from Advanced Polymer Systems, 
Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution (YSI conductivity calibrator) is used to calibrate 
specific conductivity.  Dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % saturation.  Sondes 
are deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 weeks time the 
fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling period is set for 30-minute 
intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the half-hour).  The following 
physical water quality parameters are recorded: temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (mg/l), dissolved oxygen (% 
saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A post-deployment calibration is done 
after the sonde is taken out of the water using the same calibration protocol.   
NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and the original data files are 
reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST).
	Both sondes are housed within 4-inch diameter, PVC pipes, which are 
attached to "aid-to-navigation" pilings.  The pipes are oriented vertically and 
are attached tightly with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom portion of 
the pipe is open and sits 6 inches above the bottom.  Probe readings are 
measured approximately 6-8 inches above the substrate.  Numerous 1-inch diameter 
holes are drilled circumferentially around the lowest 8 inches of the pipe to 
ensure adequate water flow around the probes.  Sondes are hung by plastic coated 
steel chain inside the pipes; the chain is bolted to the piling.  A 'kryptonite' 
bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde inside the housing.
	The sondes are further protected from fouling by restricting the openings 
within the sonde guard with plastic screening. The plastic mesh (with 0.5-cm 
square holes) was attached on the inside of the guards' circumference and on the 
inside of the guards' lowermost disk. 


5. Site location & character.
Site #1- Upper Henderson (UH):
	The "Upper Henderson" site, site #1, is located on the upper region of 
Henderson Creek.  The piling (manatee caution sign) is located right of center 
(while facing downstream) of the creek channel, approximately 50 meters 
downstream of State Hwy 951's crossing of Henderson Creek.  Facing the channel, 
this segment of Henderson Creek has RKBNERR headquarters on the left bank and a 
mangrove restoration site on the right.  A residential area, consisting of 
trailer parks, is located immediately upstream.  These may be delivering point-
source pollutants.
	The substrate within the channel is composed of organic-rich silt layer 
over fine grain sand.  The bottom is riddled with road debris and rocks from old 
seawalls.  Henderson Creek has tidal influences along with a fresh water control 
structure in its headwaters controlling its salinity range. The tide range for 
Henderson Creek varies between 0.5 and 1.5 meters.

Site #2- Upper Blackwater River (BR):	
	The " Upper Blackwater River" sonde, site #2, is located upstream at a 
juncture which leads to a small bay named Mud Bay.  The sonde is affixed to 
navigational marker #47 within the river channel.
		The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with 
little to no organics.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of the 
river.  Upstream influences consist of Collier-Semonile State Parks boat basin 
and upstream agricultural fields, adjacent to Blackwater River's main feeder 
canal, SR 41 canal.  Salinities range from 0-30ppt on average and fluctuate 
daily with the tides and seasonal rainfall.UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone

7. Associated researchers & projects.
	 RKBNERR also has a YSI 600XL, using telemetry data collection, and 
YSI6600 monitoring station recording the same physical water quality parameters 
(minus turbidity) at both sites downstream from the Upper Henderson Creek and 
the Blackwater River sites.  These units are deployed, serviced and calibrated 
using the same protocols, except for the sampling interval is hourly.  These 
data are also available upon request.

10. Data anomalies.

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, January 1999:
	No data anomalies occurred

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, February 1999:
	No data anomalies occurred

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, March 1999:
(a)	Turbidity. Turbidity values were slightly negative throughout the month 
(possibly due to calibration error with 100 NTU standard), but will remain in 
the dataset. However, upon conversion to txt. Files, slight negatives were 
converted to zero's.

(b) 	Turbidity.  Many out of range (negative or >1000 NTU) anomalous values 
were recorded (possibly due to the wiper not working properly) and will be 
deleted for the following dates/times:
		03/17/99   13:07, 13:37

12. Other remarks/notes.

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, March 1999:
 (a)	Data recorded at this site was logged at 00:05 and 00:35 minutes after 
every hour instead of the standard 00:00 and 00:30 intervals for the following 
dates/times:
		03/03/99  15:05 through 03/17/99  12:35

Site #2: Blackwater River, March 1999:
(a)	Data recorded at this site was logged at 00:02 and 00:32 minutes after 
every 
hour instead of the standard 00:00 and 00:30 intervals for the following 
dates/times:

Due to a third sample taken on the 03/17/99 because of the time variances, these 
times were corrected by pasting CDMO time templates over the incorrect times.
