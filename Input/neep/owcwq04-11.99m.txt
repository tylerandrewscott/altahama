2. Entry verification:

The data were directly downloaded from the YSI data loggers into the YSI 
PC6000 program in the PC. The data were graphed and visually checked for any 
obvious outliers. The data were then transferred to an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and spaces. All three CDMO 
macros were used to QA/QC the data.  Missing data were inserted into the 
spreadsheet and denoted by periods. The data files were then checked 
for readings that were outside the instrument range.  These data were removed 
and replaced with a period. An explanation for the missing and the deleted data 
is included in this metadata sheet.  The files were then transferred along with 
the associated metadata by disk to the CDMO.  The files are archived at OWC. 
Dr. David Klarer is responsible for both data logger deployment and data 
management.


3.Research Objectives:

Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two-week periods at 
two sites within the Old Woman Creek estuary- one in the upper reaches at State 
Route 2(SU) and the other near the mouth, just south of State Route 6 (WM). The 
purpose of this monitoring program is to document the role of Great Lakes 
estuaries in mitigating storm flow that passes through them.  


4. Research methods:

The YSI monitoring program began on 1 April, 1999 at both sites.  Prior to 
deployment of the data loggers, a 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was bolted to a metal 
sign post that had been driven into the sediment.  Each pipe had 4 rows of holes 
drilled into it spanning the area of the probe guard on the data logger so that 
the probes would have direct contact with the surrounding waters.  The data 
logger at site SU is .47 meters above the bottom, while the YSI at site WM is 
0.32 meters above the bottom. Due to very low Lake Erie water levels, it was 
necessary to move both the data logger sites  in November 1999. The data logger 
was moved less than .5 meters into a deeper water area on 10 November 1999. The 
new datalogger site was 0.275 meters deeper than the previous depth at site WM 
and 0.225 meters deeper at site SU. The data logger at site WM was 0.10 meters 
above the bottom at the new location and at site SU the data logger was 
also 0.10 meters above the bottom.  Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, 
turbidity, and specific conductance readings are taken when the instrument is 
pulled at each site. On alternate weeks, the data loggers are pulled.  The data 
is retrieved from each data logger and each data logger is recalibrated 
(according to the directions in the YSI Operations Manual) before being returned 
to the field.  Conductivity, pH (2 point calibration), and turbidity (2 point 
calibration) was calibrated using commercial standards.


5. Site location and character:

Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the southern 
shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio (Latitude 41 22' N; 
longitude 82 31' W). The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) (Latitude 41 22' 
57" N, 82 30' 52") W site is very near the southern boundary of the reserve.  
The data logger is sited near a concrete piling of the eastbound Ohio State 
Route 2 bridge.  At this site the creek is relatively deep and narrow.  Although 
water direction and flow is influenced at this site by changes in Lake Erie 
water levels, this site doesn't have direct contact with Lake Erie waters. 
The data logger at State Route 6 (WM) (Latitude 41 22' 56" N, 82 30' 26") is 
very close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In this portion of the Reserve, the 
creek is very shallow but extends over a large surface area.  This site  
frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie waters. 

6. Data collection periods:

Sampling at WM began on April 1, 1999 at 00:00:00.  Sampling ceased at WM 
site on November 30, 1999 at 23:45:00.  Sampling at SU began on April 1, 1998 at 
00:00:00.  Sampling ceased at SU site on November 30, 1999 at 23:45:00.

7. Associated projects: Samples for chemical analysis of the water and 
phytoplankton analysis are collected at each site every time the data loggers 
are changed.

10. Data anomalies (suspect data):

April 1999: 
WM: 
SU: Water levels were intermittently at or below 0 from 04/01/99 through 
04/09/99 and again from 04/15/99 through 04/17/99.  This was due to the low 
water levels so that the depth recorder was often above water level at this time 
coupled with changes in barometric pressure. Jump in DO from 73.2% to 139.2% due 
to 
redeployment of instrument at 04/19/99 (07:45).

May 1999:
WM: Two high turbidity values (>1500 NTU) on 05/04/99 (19:15) and 05/08/99 
(20:30)- could be due to biological or wind activity.  Low oxygen levels from 
05/17/99 through 05/19/99 at 08:00 due to periphyton growth on oxygen membrane. 
Low oxygen on 05/29/99 through the end of the month due to periphyton growth on 
oxygen membrane. 
SU:

June 1999:
WM: Low oxygen levels until 06/01/99 at 08:45 due to periphyton growth on oxygen 
membrane. Turbidity erractic from 06/05/99 through 06/08/99 possibly due to carp 
activity - DO and pH level off during this same time period.  Low oxygen from 
06/09/99 to 06/15/99 at 08:30 due to periphyton growth on oxygen membrane. Two 
high turbidity values (>1500 NTU) on 06/16/99 (12:30) to 06/19/99 (07:45) 
possibly due to biological activity.  
SU:

July 1999:
WM: Low and/or erratic oxygen from 07/01/99 (00:00) through 07/06/99(08:15) due 
to periphyton growth on oxygen membrane. One high turbidity value on 07/06/99 
(14:30).  Several small negative turbidity readings throughout the following 
time period: 07/18/99 (12:30) to 07/19/99 (13:15).  Negative water level 
readings from 07/09/99 (08:15 to 16:15) and 07/10/99 (00:30 to 02:30) due to low 
water levels. 
SU: Negative oxygen readings deleted 07/04/99 (05:45 to 11:15) and on 07/06/99 
(04:45; 05:30; 06:15). Oxygen readings from 07/04/99 at 05:45 through 07/06/99 
at 08:15 should be viewed with some reservation due to these negative readings.
Negative depth readings on 07/09/99 (09:30 through 18:15) due to very low water 
levels and changing barometric pressure.  

August 1999:
WM:  Turbidity erractic from 08/01/99 (00:00 to 23:30).  All data missing from 
08/23/99 (21:15) reason unknown (glitch in datalogger?)	
SU: 

September 1999:
WM: Negative oxygen readings from 09/05/99 (05:30); (06:30 to 07:00); (07:30).
One high turbidity value on 09/14/99 (18:30).  Negative oxygen readings deleted 
from 09/05/99 (23:45) through 09/06/00 (09:45), on 09/07/99 (00:30 and 07:15) 
and on 09/08/99 (00:00-00:15; 03:30-03:45; 05:45; 06:15-06:30). Oxygen readings 
from 09/05/99 at 23:45 through 09/08/99 at 07:15 should be viewed with some 
reservation due to these negative readings. 
SU:

October 1999:
WM:
SU: Negative oxygen readings deleted from 10/16/99 (11:45-13:15; 15:15-16:30;

through 10/18/99 (15:45); 10/18/99 (19:45) through 10/23/99 (13:15); 10/31/99 
(09:15- 12:30)- probe failure.  All oxygen readings from 10/16/99 through the 
end of the month are suspect due to problems with the oxygen probe.  Negative 
water level readings from 10/22/99 (05:30 to 06:00) due to low water levels.  

November 1999:
WM: All data deleted 11/05/99 (19:00) through 11/10/99 (15:45) data logger out 
of water. Negative depth readings on: 11/12/99 (14:45-23:15); 11/13/99 (09:00-
12:45; 13:15-13:45); 11/13/99 (20:45) through 11/14/99 (08:45); 11/15/99 (12:45-
15:15; 16:15-16:30); 11/17/99 (11:30); 11/17/99 (21:15) through 11/18/99 
(16:15); 11/18/99 (19:30) through 11/19/99 (18:45); 11/20/99 (15:00); 11/22/99 
(07:15)- due to very low water levels. 
SU: Negative Dissolved Oxygen readings deleted 11/01/99 (05:00; 06:45-09:15;

from 11/01/99 (00:00) through 11/03/99 (08:00) suspect due to oxygen probe 
failure.  Jump in DO due to redeployment of instrument on 11/03/99 (08:15);
Jump in DO due to redeployment of instrument on 11/10/99 (16:00). 
Negative water level readings 11/13/99 (20:00) through 11/14/99 
(09:45); 11/23/99 (19:30) through 11/24/99 (03:15); 11/25/99 (22:15-22:30); 
11/26/99 (05:45) through 11/27/99 (02:00); 11/27/99 (04:30) due to low water 
levels.
