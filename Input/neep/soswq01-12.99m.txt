2.	Entry verification
The data are uploaded from the YSI-6000 data logger in the PC6000 format using 
the PC6000 software.  Graphs are printed for an initial visual QA/QC check of 
the data.  Using the Export command, the .dat files are saved in the PC6000 
software as .csv files.  A CDMO macro imports data files into a monthly MS Excel 
spreadsheet.  Missing dates and times are inserted into the spreadsheet as 
necessary.  Data files are then run through CDMO Excel 5.0 macros that: 1) add 
periods to cells with no data points; 2) check for variable outliers; 3) correct 
date and time intervals; and 4) format the data columns to the CDMO standard.  
The file is then printed out, and the data reviewed.  Pre- and post-deployment 
calibration data are used to verify probe reliability throughout the sampling 
period.  Data are deleted only if the probe has failed mechanically or 
electronically or (after Research Coordinator review) if the data are clearly 
not possible given the specific site characteristics.  The data files are saved 
as Text (tab delimited) within the MS Excel software and are submitted to the 
CDMO via FTP.  Regional Watershed Coordinator Sue Powell has been in charge of 
data management since 9/99. 

3.	Research objectives
The South Slough NERR Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program is designed as 
a Before/After, Control/Impact Study.  The purpose of the research is to 
determine if the restoration activities change water quality parameters in a 
measurable way.  The YSI-6000 data loggers are deployed within the South Slough 
watershed along estuarine tidal channels immediately adjacent to intertidal salt 
marshes.  One station serves a reference site and is located in the Sengstacken 
Arm (Talbot Creek) adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural marsh.  The second station 
serves as a non-point assessment site.  It is located in the Winchester Arm of 
the slough adjacent to a dike-removal/marsh restoration area (5.1 ha) and 4.2 ha 
of natural marsh (Rumrill and Cornu 1995).  The Valino Island site, installed in 
June 1999, is a second reference area which is located in the main tidal channel 
of South Slough, downstream from both of the other sites.  

4.	Research methods
Measurements with YSI data loggers are taken every 30 minutes over 22 day 
(approximately) periods.  Sonde cleaning and calibrations of the DO, 
conductivity, depth, pH and turbidity probes are performed as outlined in the 
YSI manual. For conductivity and salinity, YSI conductivity calibrator solution 
3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used without dilution.  For pH calibrations, Corning  pH 
7 and 10 solutions are used, and for turbidity, Hach turbidity standard is 
diluted to 100 NTU.  To deploy, each data logger is lowered by chain into a 
protective case constructed of 4-inch diameter ABS plumbing pipe that is affixed 
vertically on an existing log piling driven into the mud.  The cases were 
drilled out to ensure adequate tidal flushing and exposure of the probes to 
ambient water conditions.  The sensor arrays are held 0.5 m off the bottom of 
the tidal channels that are approximately 3 m deep at high tide.  Access to the 
sonde sites are by skiff or sea kayak.  The sondes are out of the field for 24-
60 hours for cleaning, downloading and calibration.  Post-deployment 
calibrations are performed immediately upon retrieval to determine if instrument 
drift has occurred.

5.	Site location and character
South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-
Pacific subarea of the Columbian Bioregion, from Cape Mendicino, California, 
north to the Columbia River estuary.  The mouth of South Slough, located 
approximately 8 km southwest of the city of Coos Bay, Oregon, is one of seven 
tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos estuary.  The three sites within 
the South Slough that are monitored with YSI data loggers are:

1)  Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W]  
This station serves as a reference site located in the eastern riverine portion 
of the estuary and is approximately 7.7 km from the mouth of the South Slough 
estuary.  It is adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural marsh. Tidal range is 
approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt.  Freshwater inputs 
have not been quantified. 

2)  Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project site):  
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 deg 19.216' W]    
This station serves as a management-treatment site located in the western 
riverine portion of the estuary and is approximately 7.3 km from the mouth of 
the South Slough estuary.  The site is adjacent to the Winchester Tidelands 
Restoration Project, where dikes were removed from a 5.1 ha area in 1996 and 
1998.  About 4.2 hectares of natural marsh surround the project site.  Tidal 
range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-28 ppt. Freshwater 
inputs are between 1-23 cfs.   

Both sites 1 and 2 are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to 
intertidal marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera 
marina).  The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in 
channel width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel with regard 
to the predominant north-south winds.  The watershed above both sites is 
primarily second-growth coniferous forest, and there are few industrial and 
residential sites in the watershed.  Outside the boundary of the Reserve, the 
South Slough watershed is managed primarily for the production of timber (i.e., 
71% cover classification for commercial timber).

3)  Valino Island:  [43 deg 19.034' N, 124 deg 19.298' W]
This station serves as a secondary reference area located in the marine-
dominated central portion of the estuary and is approximately 3.6 km  from the 
mouth of South Slough estuary.  The Valino Island station is located in the 
primary tidal channel and is adjacent to expansive eelgrass beds, tidal 
mudflats, sandflats, and commercial oyster cultivation areas.  The tidal range 
is about 11.5 ft. and salinity ranges between 10-33 ppt.

10.	Data anomalies
	
Editing of data followed CDMO protocol.  Data outside the range specifications 
of the instrument were rejected, except for depth and turbidity.  Negative depth 
values were not rejected unless they corresponded to specific conductivity data 
indicating that the sonde was out of the water.  Large positive turbidity spikes 
(>100 NTU) were reported in the anomalous data section.  In general, if no probe 
failure could be documented from the pre- and post-deployment calibration data, 
the data were retained but reported in the anomalous data section.  A hand-held 
YSI 85 was used for field calibration.  DO, temperature, salinity, and 
conductivity were recorded at the surface and near the bottom during deployment 
and retrieval of the sondes.
