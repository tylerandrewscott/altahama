2. Entry Verification:

	The data are downloaded to an IBM compatible computer from the Hydrolab 
Datasonde I, Hydrolab Datasonde III, Hydrolab Recorder, or YSI 6000UPG as a raw 
file.  The YSI 6000 data are reviewed using the YSI computer program PC6000 that 
accompanies the YSI 6000 data logger.  After the file is uploaded from the 
datatlogger, PC6000 is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.)  This information is printed out 
and attached to the Field Log for the particular deployment.  The information 
obtained from this printout is used during file review to detect any gross 
outliers such as data taken when the datalogger was removed from the water or 
those caused by instrument failure.  Georgianne Coker, Research Technician, was 
responsible for the data collection, management, and monitoring of the three 
sites.  The data are imported into a Microsoft Excel file that contains the 
current month’s cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of data has been 
recorded the file is ready for review.  The data review includes several steps.  
The first step is to format the data so that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order and the data has the correct number of decimal place holders by 
using the Column Reformat CDMO Excel 5.0 Macro.   Secondly, the Date Hour Count 
CDMO Excel 5.0 macro is used to determine if there are any dates and times that 
data was not recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  
Missing dates and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into 
the cells where data would normally be.  The reason for the missing data is 
recorded on the Water Quality Editing Log.  Next, the data are filtered using 
the Find Variable Outlier CDMO Excel 5.0 macro to find readings outside the 
instrument measurement range and the “normal” range for the site in question.  
Data outside the instrument range is/are removed from the file and a period is 
inserted to the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing dates and times are 
recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.  Data that was outside the “normal” 
range of water quality for a particular site is investigated for validity based 
on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument 
diagnostics.  If the data is/are rejected from the file a period is inserted to 
the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto 
the Water quality Editing Log.  The information recorded on the Water Quality 
Editing Log is transferred to the Metadata form.  The Metadata form is the 
submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Stacey Webb, reserve fellow, was 
responsible for the QA/QC of the database.   

3. Research Objectives:

	The purpose of research was only to perform long term water quality 
monitoring and not a specific experiment.   Sapelo Island is only accessible by 
passenger ferry.  Due to its isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the 
SINERR show little evidence of human impact.  The Marsh Landing site receives a 
large amount of boat traffic, as it is the primary access point for the 
approximately 200-300 residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off 
loading.  The Barn Creek site receives moderate boat traffic, and is near a 
mechanic shop on land and several residences.  The Flume Dock site is a 
relatively isolated location compared to the other two sites.

4.   Research Methods:

	The monitoring program began in August of 1986 at the Flume Dock and Marsh 
Landing sites.  The Barn Creek site was added in May 1995.  The units are hung 
vertically from a float or floating dock so they hang two meters below the 
surface.  Thus, depth was considered fixed and not measured.  Hydrolab units 
were used exclusively until May 1995.  Beyond that point, YSI units were used as 
well as the Hydrolabs.  The probes are cleaned three times weekly during the 
warmer months.  No pre- or post-calibrations were performed.  The Dissolved 
Oxygen probes are cleaned once weekly with a cotton swab soaked in methanol, 
while the other probes are cleaned with cotton swabs or pipe cleaners and de-
ionized water.  After two weeks the units are returned to the lab for 
downloading, cleaning and recalibration, according to the manufacturers 
manual.  Before each YSI PC6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.  Calibration 
standards are only required for pH, conductivity, and turbidity, all other 
parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 2 point 
calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased from a scientific supply house.  The 
conductivity standard is made using a 0.2 M solution of KCl (24.82mS/cm=14.92 
g/L).  The turbidity calibration uses distilled water made by the University of 
Georgia-Athens Marine Institute.  The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced 
before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24 hours prior to deployment. 
	The datalogger is placed inside a length of PVC pipe attached to the dock.  
Every 30 minutes during the sampling period measurements are taken for 
temperature, specific conductance, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, 
depth and turbidity. 	During the stage of deployment the datalogger is checked 
for fouling and cleaned.  This can be one to three times a week depending on the 
time of year.  At the end of the sample period the datalogger is retrieved 
and immediately replaced by another calibrated datalogger.  The datalogger is 
then taken to the lab where the data is uploaded, and the probe is cleaned.

5. Site Location and character:

	The Sapelo Island Natinal Estuarine Research Reserve is located in a tidal 
estuary on the western side of Sapelo Island on the coast of Georgia.  The 
Duplin River, actually a tidal lagoon, that receives little fresh water and 
opens into Doboy Sound, ca. 5 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean.  The marsh 
is inundated twice daily by unequal tides with a mean range of 2.1m.  Salinity 
ranges from 10 to 25 ppt.  The surrounding area vegetation is dominated by salt 
marsh with Spartina alterniflora being the predominate flora.  There are three 
monitoring stations located within the reserve.

1) Marsh Landing: located on the lower Duplin River on Sapelo Island (Latitude: 
31° 25’ 4”N, Longitude 81° 17’ 46”W). Water passing the Marsh landing site 
during flood tide originates from the Doboy Sound.  The Doboy receives input 
from the Atlantic Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway.  
The water is pushed up the river or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed 
onto the marsh surface by the flood tide and recedes into the main channel 
during ebb tide.  The dock itself is used as the main dock to the island where 
the ferry makes several daily runs.  There are also several small boats that are 
docked there. 
2) Barn Creek: located on a tributary of the Duplin river between the Marsh 
Landing and Flume Dock sites (Lattitude: 31° 26’ 21N, Longitude 81° 16’ 43”W).  
It is impacted by a small boat dock, a mechanic shop nearby on land, as well as 
several houses near its marshes. 
3) Flume Dock: located on the upper Duplin River on Sapelo Island (Lattitude: 
31° 28’ 58N, Longitude 81° 17’ 3”W).  It is influenced by tidal currents which 
flood the marsh on high tides and recede into the channel of the river and its 
side creeks.  It receives far less boat traffic than the Marsh Landing site. 

6. Data collection period: 

	Although data has been collected at the Marsh Landing and Flume Dock sites 
since 1986, an additional site, Barn Creek was added and all sites started May 
1995 for the NERRS SWMP.  

7.  Associated researchers and projects:

	Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the 
University of Georgia Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the island became 
a working laboratory for many.  Given UGAMI’s long history on Sapelo, a 
bibliographic list of over 800 articles of current and previous research can be 
found on the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/UGAMI).
