2)Entry Verification Process:

The data are uploaded using the computer program EcoWatch that accompanies the 
YSI 6000 datalogger.  After the file is uploaded from the water quality 
instrument, EcoWatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.).  This information is printed out 
and attached to the Field Log for the particular deployment. This printout is 
used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the 
water quality instrument  removed from the water or those caused by instrument 
failure. The data are exported as a .cdf file and then opened in a Microsoft 
Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative recordings. As each 
deployment is added the data are reviewed for overlapping dates and times, and 
edited to only include the measurements taken while the instrument is in the 
water. Once a complete month of data is acquired the file is reviewed to make 
sure the parameter columns are in the correct order and that depth had been 
measured in meters.  The data is also checked for data gaps that may have 
resulted from sonde exchanging.  If gaps are found they are documented on the 
Water Quality Editing Log.  The monthly data file is then cut and pasted into 
the form sheet of the CDMO Import macro.  The Import macro is used to insert 
periods into cells where data would normally be and to change feet to meters (if 
necessary).  Next, the data file is saved and monthly graphs for each parameter 
are generated and reviewed.  The data file is then filtered using the CDMO 
cdmomac3 macro to format columns, tabulate the number of recordings per month, 
and to find variable outliers, readings outside the instrument measurement 
range. Data outside the instrument range are removed from the file 
and a period is inserted into the cell(s), with the exception of turbidity and 
depth, which are manually reviewed.  An explanation for the missing dates and 
times are recorded in the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside the "normal" 
range of water quality for a particular site are investigated for validity based 
on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument 
diagnostics. If the data are rejected from the file a period is inserted into 
the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and times is recorded on 
the Water Quality Data Editing Log. The metadata for the monitoring year is 
updated based on the information from the Water Quality Data Editing Log and any 
other changes that have been made during the year. The metadata form is then 
submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  William Thompson, Research 
Technician, and Tara Nye, Research Biologist, are responsible for data 
management during 2000.  


3)Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Research Creek and Zeke's Island 
components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve and are 
anchored to the bottom of the selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30-
minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. These sites are relatively 
unimpacted by manmade perturbations and are considered long term monitoring 
locations.  The goal is to establish long-term water quality monitoring at 
relatively unimpacted sites by collecting data for each day of the year.  


4)Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March 1992 at the 
Research Creek component, and 19 May 1994 at the Zeke's Island component. The 
procedures described below were instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover 
data recorded previously. At this time we are only performing long term water 
quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance are performed 
following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections 
3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are only required for pH, turbidity and 
salinity; all other parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer 
solutions for a two-point pH calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased pre-made 
from a scientific supply house. The conductivity standard is obtained from YSI. 
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to 
settle at least 24 hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in the 
field observation log. The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked 
steel cage, then anchored approximately 10cm off the bottom, and chained to a 
post at the monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 
measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, pH, and 
turbidity.  As part of a preliminary performance check of the YSI chlorophyll 
probe (YSI 6025), the sensor was deployed every other deployment at Masonboro 
Island from June until November.  Although the data are not reported here, 
information can be obtained by contacting the Research Coordinator at the NOC 
NERR (see above contact information). 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is brought back to 
the laboratory.  The weather and water quality measurements are again noted in 
the field observation log. The calibration drift and the effect of biofouling on 
the water quality instrument are checked by comparing data readings in 
calibration standards. The water quality data are then uploaded, and the 
instrument is cleaned and calibrated as noted previously. 


5)Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(from north to south) are: Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and 
Zeke's Island. They are located along the southeastern coast of the United 
States in the Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro and 
Zeke's Island components are transferred to the CDMO. The two sites are: 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island (RC)
The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of Whiskey Creek, 
and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a small navigable channel called 
Research Creek at 34 deg 09'21.7" latitude and 77 deg 50'59.9" longitude. The 
site has a salinity range of 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.2 
meters. Depth varies, but typically it can be found to range from 0.38 to 2.11 
meters.  Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus based sediment.  
There are no major pollutants from the land, and the sole freshwater source for 
Masonboro Island is from rain.  The site is removed from the shoreline, in a 
creek surrounded by salt marsh that has minimal to no boat traffic.  

2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island (EC)
The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal Point boat launch in a 
tidal basin estuary at 33 deg 56'23.5" latitude and 77 deg 56'28.1" longitude. 
This site receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear River 
through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies of water.  The New 
Inlet, which opened in 1761 and remained stable until artificial closure in 
1881, has provided ocean water to the estuary in the past.  It has opened and 
closed throughout its history at the whim of each passing hurricane.  The inlet 
closed after hurricane Bonnie in 1998 and has remained closed for this set of 
data.  The site has a salinity range of 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that 
averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found to range from 
0.11 to 2.30 meters.  Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus based 
sediment.  There are no pollutants from land.  The site is surrounded by marsh 
and dunes, not accessible to road traffic and minimal boat traffic.


6) Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while East Cribbing data collection commenced on 19 May 1994. All monitoring is considered long term.

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zeke’s Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserve’s historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.


11) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section lists and explains all anomalous (suspect) data that has either 
been deleted or still remains in the data set.  The data are either extreme for 
the aquatic system being monitored or are outside the measurement range of the 
instrument. The cause of such anomalies may be a bad calibration, boat traffic 
disturbances, or malfunction of the instrument.  It's also possible that the 
datalogger may be measuring a real event.

11) Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, and elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.


12) Notes:

High turbidity values above instrument's top range (1000 NTU), caused by 
blockage of light transmittance by an obstruction are left in the file.

Start of each sample was delayed during the deployment of 05/09/00 to 05/10/00 
at Research Creek by one minute past the hour and half hour.  Time was 
corrected in the file to on the hour and half hour.

Start times during the deployment of 05/26/00 to 05/31/00 at Research Creek 
were corrected in the file from three minutes past the hour and half hour to on 
the hour and half hour.

Start times of each sample was delayed during the deployment of 06/02/00 to 
06/16/00 at Research Creek by 15 minutes after the hour and half hour. Time 
was corrected in the file to the hour and half hour.

Start times of each sample were off by 52 seconds and were corrected to the hour 
and half hour in each of the following deployments:
At Masonboro			East Cribbing

Negative or zero depth readings were not deleted because the salinity and DO 
readings indicated that the sonde was submerged during these periods.
