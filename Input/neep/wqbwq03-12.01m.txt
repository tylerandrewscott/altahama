2)	Entry verification:

		The data are uploaded in three file formats (each to separate files 
identified with the same file name but with unique extensions) from the YSI 6000 
and 6600 data loggers to a PC with the YSI 6000 and 6600 EcoWatch software.  Two 
of these (PC6000 and ASCII text formats) are kept on file in the WBNERR archive.  
The comma delimited format data file (.csv) is imported to the EXCEL spreadsheet 
program (version 5.0) where it is processed according to standard NERRS CDMO 
protocol using the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros.  File size of one complete month of 
data each has been achieved by concatenating (and truncating if necessary) 
shorter files of interrupted data segments.  File contents are examined for 
anomalies (e.g., sensor malfunction, battery failure, spurious values, etc.) by 
visualization of data with the Ecowatch Software provided by YSI.  The data is 
also graphed using the Excel program for each two-week deployment of raw data.  
Data requiring editing are noted and copies of the graphs of raw data are saved 
at WBNERR.  Data editing to CDMO protocol is conducted in Excel.  Missing data 
(data logger malfunction or maintenance periods) are represented by periods 
(".").  Outliers (data values not within the design range of the respective 
sensors except for turbidity and depth) are changed to periods.  Data values 
recorded during deployment or retrieval (i.e., when the instrument was out of 
the water or in the laboratory) are deleted or replaced with periods.  A record 
of changes is documented in the Data Anomalies section of the metadata file. The 
monthly files are sent electronically by FTP to CDMO.  
The CDMO cdmomac3.xls will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file 
from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data. In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.
Copies of all files are retained at the Reserve. During Deployment Year 2001, 
the Research Assistant, Kelly Chapman, performed all instrument calibration and 
maintenance and data management. 

3)	Research objectives:

For the NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program, the YSI data loggers are programmed 
to record water quality parameters every 30 minutes. Two monitoring sites were 
located in the Waquoit Bay estuarine system during 2001.  One is located roughly 
in the middle of Waquoit Bay's main basin and the other is located adjacent to 
Eel Pond Inlet on Vineyard Sound - one of the two tidal inlets into the 
Waquoit Bay estuary.
The main purpose of the SWMP water quality monitoring program is to aid Waquoit 
Bay NERR in one of its priority missions: to be used as a living laboratory and 
platform for coastal and estuarine research. The long term, continuous detailed 
monitoring of the estuary's basic physical parameters is an essential tool and 
context for any research activities located here. Besides this overarching 
mission, there are also several specific research interests.  One primary issue 
for the Waquoit Bay ecosystem is the influence of anthropogenic induced 
alterations by nitrogen enrichment.  Waquoit Bay receives nitrogen from several 
sources, such as septic systems (their leachate percolates into groundwater 
which then enters the bay), run off from roads, run off containing domestic and 
agricultural fertilizer and animal waste, and atmospheric sources. This elevated 
nitrogen loading to the bay has resulted in enhanced eutrophication that have 
contributed to alterations of habitats in the bay.  For example, thick mats of 
seaweeds (macroaglae) now cover the bottom where eelgrass meadows thrived in the 
1970's.  Unfortunately, there are few definitive records of bay conditions 
during that period, which makes it difficult to evaluate the rates of change.  
To facilitate future evaluation, long-term records from the SWMP can be used to 
track water column conditions.  Of particular interest are measurements of 
dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, and  chlorophyll (Chl).  Such records will 
facilitate evaluation of changes which may come about from a continuation of 
watershed alteration that result from "traditional" development (i.e., non-
sewered residential areas served by private septic systems typically consisting 
of septic tanks and leach fields) as well as non-industrial commercial 
development, such as golf courses, cranberry bogs, and retail shopping outlets.  
The records will be useful for evaluating the efficacy of remediation efforts 
intended to reduce the nitrogen loading from these sources to Waquoit Bay.
		Another focus of long-term research interest is the detection of 
climate change and the determination of its effects on the estuarine 
environment.  Characterizing the variability of the various water column 
parameters, such as their scale, magnitude and frequency, is likely to be an 
important aspect of the estuarine ecosystem, that may be sensitive to climate 
change. Related to this focus is an interest in the impact of storms (hurricanes 
and northeasters) and other extreme meteorological events on the estuary. For 
example, what temperature and wind field thresholds exist that might bring about 
or trigger certain conditions within the bay? The observations recorded by the 
SWMP will allow for these types of studies.      

4)	Research methods:

YSI 6000 and 6600 series sondes are deployed at each permanent water quality 
monitoring station at the Waquoit Bay Reserve. Since in-situ instrumentation can 
only record conditions at a specific location, permanent monitoring stations for 
SWMP are chosen to be in some way representative of the overall estuary. This is 
difficult in practice since estuaries by their very definition are coastal 
regions where large physical, chemical and biological variations tend to occur 
in space and time, so that often no particular location within the system is 
"typical" of the overall system. Establishing a number of stations can overcome 
this problem somewhat, but as of 2001 and still in the early years of our SWMP 
program at Waquoit Bay, we have established only two permanent stations in the 
Waquoit Bay estuaries. We expect to double this number to four in 2002. That 
said, our current SWMP stations, referred to as Metoxit Point and Menauhant are 
situated so as to be as representative as much as possible of the estuary and 
its inputs/outputs. Additional details concerning the station characteristics 
are discussed in the next section. 
		The YSI sondes measure and record ambient water temperature, 
specific conductivity (and calculate salinity), dissolved oxygen (mg/L and % 
saturated), turbidity (NTU), water level (m), and pH at 30 minute intervals 
during deployment periods extending for approximately two weeks. Note that the 
pressure sensors we currently use are unvented and so variations in atmospheric 
pressure are recorded as changes in water depth (atmospheric data are available 
for the region and so it is possible to make this correction to the depth data). 
Also, at our Metoxit Point site during 2001 we have been using a YSI chlorophyll 
6025 sensor and these data are available by contacting us directly at the 
reserve (and included in the raw files for this year's SWMP data set for CDMO).
		Sondes are deployed and retrieved approximately every two weeks. The 
"old" sonde is retrieved and a "new" replacement sonde is deployed immediately 
so that ideally no record gap occurs. The two week deployment duration is 
constrained by a combination of battery life (shorter life in colder waters) 
and fouling of the DO sensor (and other sensors to a lesser degree) during the 
warm summer months. Prior to deployment (within 24 hrs), each instrument is 
checked and its sensors re-calibrated using standard YSI (Operating Manual) 
protocols. Similarly, after a deployment, each sonde is brought back to 
the laboratory for a post-deployment check, data downloading, instrument and 
sensor cleaning. Salinity sensors are calibrated with reference seawater that 
had been previously analyzed with a Guildline salinometer at the Woods Hole 
Oceanographic Institution.  pH sensors are calibrated with 7.0 and 10.0 pH 
standard solutions (2-point calibrations). The turbidity standard used was Hach 
100 NTU, and distilled water (DI) for 0 NTU. Temperature sensors were not 
calibrated.  Oxygen sensor membranes were inspected before and after each 
deployment.  Oxygen sensor membranes were replaced 24 hours prior to 
each deployment when the sensor seemed to need reconditioning. Final DO 
calibration was not done until the membrane had been in place for at least 8 
hours. As another check on instrument performance, in-situ measurements of air 
and water temperature, DO, salinity, water temperature and chlorophyll grabs 
were taken at deployment/retrieval times.  Air and water temperature were 
measured with a simple thermometer.  DO was determined by the Winkler titration 
procedure, using a LaMotte DO field kit.  Salinity was measured using a 
hydrometer and chlorophyll samples were analyzed using a Hach 4000 
spectrophotometer for chlorophyll-a determination.  
No SWMP data were collected in 2001 prior to March due to ice-over conditions 
that extended from late December 2000 into late February 2001, which prevented 
boat operation in much of the bay (in fact, our research boat used to service 
the SWMP stations was hauled out until mid-March). The Metoxit Point station was 
reoccupied first, following by the initial occupation of the Menauhant station 
(a new SWMP site) a couple days later.  Different types of mooring silos were 
used to hold the sondes at each of the stations. The Metoxit Point station is 
located near the middle of the main basin and distant from shore structures. The 
sonde mooring for this station (first installed in July 2000) consists of a 
vertical PVC pipe tower (2" ID), about 1.5 meters in height) extending from a 
120 lb cast concrete base resting on the bottom. Attached to this tower is a 0.7 
m PVC pipe section (4" ID), referred to as the silo, that holds the sonde and is 
adjustable for setting the depth of the sensor package. The sondes are lowered 
and inserted into the 4" PVC silo from the surface at low water, when the top of 
the tower is only about 0.3 m below the surface. The lower part of the silo 
section is exposed to allow the YSI sonde's sensors direct exposure to the flow 
of ambient waters. The Metoxit Point silo is set so that the sensor package is 
0.75 m off the bottom. This  ensures that the sensors are above the dense macro 
algal mats that cover the bottom of much of the bay.  The mooring tower was 
completely cleaned of fouling growth (including barnacles and mussels) in mid-
summer and the sonde silo's inside was scrubbed of any algal growth before each 
deployment. The Menauhant station is a shore-side location and its mooring is a 
more typical type of silo - a single PVC section (4" ID) mounted vertically on a 
pier that extends into a tidal inlet. The base of the silo is ventilated with 
large holes (1.5" diameter) and its sensor package (bottom of the sonde) is 
mounted within a 0.4 m distance off the bottom.  This mooring was also cleaned 
of fouling growth several times during the year to ensure rapid flushing with 
ambient waters.  

   

5)	Site location and character:

General description of Waquoit Bay estuarine system: 
		The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (WBNERR) is 
located in the northeastern United States on the southern coast of Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts.  About 8,000 people maintain permanent residency in Waquoit Bay's 
drainage area, which covers parts of the towns of Falmouth, Mashpee, and 
Sandwich. During summer months, the population swells 2-3 fold with the greatest 
housing concentrations immediate to the coastline (water views and frontage). In 
addition, the upper portions of the watershed include a military base, Otis Air 
Force Base and the Massachusetts Military Reservation, portions of which have 
been designated by the EPA as Superfund sites due to past practices of dumping 
jet fuel and other groundwater contaminants.  
   	WBNERR's estuaries are representative of shallow coastal lagoons that 
occur from Cape Cod to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. WBNERR is within the Virginian 
biogeographic province, on the transitional border (Cape Cod) between the 
Virginian and the Acadian biogeographic province to the north.
	Like many embayments located on glacial outwash plains, Waquoit Bay is 
shallow, fronted by prominent barrier beaches (i.e., those of South Cape Beach 
State Park and Washburn Island), and is backed by salt marshes and upland 
coastal forests of scrub pine and oak.  Two narrow, navigable inlets, reinforced 
with granite jetties, pass through two barrier beaches to connect Waquoit Bay 
with Vineyard Sound to the south.  A third shallow and generally un-navigable 
inlet opened through the Washburn Island barrier beach during Hurricane Bob in 
August 1991, and has migrated westward since. Though open throughout 
2001, this small tidal inlet finally closed up in February 2002. 
		Bottom sediments in the bay are organic rich silts and medium sands. 
Thick (up to 0.3 m) macroalgae (seaweed) mats overlie much of the bottom of the 
bay, and largely consist of species Cladophora vagabunda, Gracilaria 
tikvahiayae, and Enteromorpha. The dominant marsh vegetation in Waquoit Bay is 
Spartina alterniflora and Spartina patens. Dominant upland vegetation includes 
mixed forests of red oak, white oak, and pitch pine, and other shrubs and plants 
common to coastal New England. Land-use in the bay's watershed is about 60% 
natural vegetation, but the remaining land is largely residential, with some 
commercial (retail malls), and minor amounts of agriculture (~3%) (cranberry 
bogs).
		Dense housing developments cover the two peninsulas that form the 
western shore of the Waquoit Bay estuarine system.  Although the developments 
themselves are outside of the Reserve boundaries, nitrogen in discharges from 
their septic systems (via groundwater) and in fertilizer run-off from their 
lawns has significant effects on the functioning of the Waquoit Bay ecosystem. 
These impacts have been a primary subject of study at the Reserve since its 
designation (1988).  One outcome of this research has been the delineation of 
sub-watersheds within the overall drainage area for Waquoit Bay, of which 
WBNERR is a small part. This knowledge allows for the design of experiments 
based on the spatial variation of nutrient loading and other land-use related 
impacts.
		At the northern end of the bay, an area comprising a separate sub-
watershed, coastal bluffs of glacial till rise 30 feet above sea level. The 
northern basin of the bay, just below these bluffs, is its deepest area 
(approximately 3 m MLW), while much of the remainder of the bay is about 1.5 m. 
Bourne, Bog, and Caleb Ponds are freshwater kettle hole ponds on the northern-
most shore of the bay.  As components of the same sub-watershed, they have a 
common albeit minor freshwater outflow into the bay's northern basin via a 
narrow channel through a brackish marsh. To the east and south, other sub-
watersheds surround several salt and freshwater ponds, including Hamblin and 
Jehu Ponds, brackish salt ponds that are connected to the main bay by the tidal 
waters of Little and Great Rivers, respectively.  The shorelines of the ponds 
are developed with residences that are occupied both seasonally and year round. 
Hamblin Pond and Little River are components of one sub-watershed, and Jehu Pond 
and Great River are elements of a separate sub-watershed. Further south lies 
Sage Lot Pond. It is in the least developed sub-watershed and also contains a 
barrier beach and salt marsh ecosystem of the reserve's South Cape Beach State 
Park. To the east of Sage Lot Pond and within the same sub-watershed, lies the 
highly brackish Flat Pond. It receives minimal tidal flows of salt water from 
Sage Lot Pond through a narrow, excavated and culverted channel. The 
preponderance of the input to Flat Pond is groundwater and run off, both of 
which are likely affected (e.g., nutrients, pesticides, bacteria) by an adjacent 
golf course and near-by upper-scale residential development.
		The largest source of surface freshwater to Waquoit Bay is the 
Quashnet / Moonakis River.  (Although named "river", this and the reserve's 
Childs River are more appropriately described as "rivulets" because of their 
small channels and discharge ~1.0 CFS.  A component of yet another sub-
watershed, it originates in Johns Pond situated north of the bay and traverses 
forests, cranberry bogs, residential areas, and the Quashnet Valley Golf Course 
before entering the bay near the southern "boundary" of the northern basin. 
("Quashnet" applies to that portion of the river within the town of 
Mashpee, and "Moonakis" refers to the brackish estuary at the river's mouth, 
lying in the town of Falmouth.  Quashnet will be used hereafter to refer to the 
entire river.)  The Quashnet River's tidal portion has sufficient numbers of 
coliform bacteria to cause it to be closed to shell fishing most of the time. 
The source(s) of this bacteria (human or avian) is unknown at this time.
 	The Childs River is the second largest input of surface freshwater to the 
bay.  A component of  another sub-watershed, it runs through densely developed 
residential areas. The Childs River sub-watershed receives the highest nitrogen 
loading and is the largest nitrogen contributor to the Waquoit Bay system of all 
the sub-watersheds. In the upper tidal portions of the river we have 
consistently recorded the highest chlorophyll levels and the lowest dissolved 
oxygen readings of any region in the bay and so this location represents an end-
member for looking at anthropogenic inputs and impacts on the system.  
Another, albeit smaller, source of freshwater is the discharge of Red Brook 
through brackish marshlands into Hamblin Pond.  Additional freshwater enters the 
bay elsewhere through groundwater seepage (perhaps up to 50% of all freshwater 
input into the bay), precipitation and the flows of small brooks. There is 
relatively little surface water runoff entering directly into the bay due to the 
high percolation rates of Cape Cod's coarse, sandy soils.
		Knowledge of the homo/heterogenity of the water masses in Waquoit 
Bay was originally derived from measurements made by reserve staff and from data 
obtained by the reserve's volunteer water quality monitoring group, the Waquoit 
BayWatchers who have collected depth profiles of Waquoit Bay water quality since 
1993. Subsequent research by reserve staff (including some numerical modeling by 
T. Isaji) has revealed that lateral mixing has considerable influence because 
tidal currents follow a general course through the bay. This results in an 
overall structure to horizontal patterns of water quality characteristics. 
The pattern it produces is a gyre in the central portion of the main bay whereby 
currents follow a generally counter-clockwise flow around a central area that 
exhibits reduced exchange with the remainder of the bay. The flushing rate 
within the gyre is diminished when compared with other more peripheral 
areas of the bay. The location of the gyre meanders slightly, apparently under 
the influence of tides and wind. Because of the shallow conditions, restricted 
tidal inlets, and low amplitude tidal forcing of Vineyard Sound here (tides are 
semi-diurnal with a range about 0.5 m) water levels in the bay are also 
strongly influenced by wind forcing. Southerly winds increase tidal heights and 
advance the phase of the flood and retard the phase of ebb (Northerly winds have 
the opposite effect). 

		The Metoxit Point station (MP) (41º 34.131' N 070º 31.294' W, 2.2 m 
deep) initiated in 1998, is located in the main basin of Waquoit Bay and was 
selected to be within or near the outer regions of the gyre (described above) 
and more or less represents "typical" water mass conditions and residence times 
for the bay. The location is at least a half mile from shore, well flushed by 
tides, and is in an area that is minimally disturbed by routine activities on 
the bay (e.g. boat traffic, shell fishing, etc.). Bottom sediments at the site 
are organic rich muds overlain by thick agal mats. Because of this sites fairly 
open exposure to south (greatest fetch over the bay), we have observed that when 
sustained winds are greater than about 20 knots out of the south, the Metoxit 
Point site experiences increased turbidity.  Salinity values for this site range 
from approximately 26 ppt to 32 ppt. 
		The Menauhant station (MH) (41º 33.156' N 070º 32.912' W, 1.2 m 
deep), initiated this year in late March 2001, is located within the Eel Pond 
Inlet at the Menauhant Yacht Club dock.  Eel Pond Inlet is the westernmost of 
the two main tidal inlets into the Waquoit Bay system. The site was chosen 
because it occupies one of the strategic locations for gauging the system's 
water mass characteristics. Entering waters represent the marine end-member 
while outflows represent the final product of estuarine water mass modification 
and export to shelf waters.  The site also has easy walk-in access to a secure 
private pier that extends into the throat of the inlet.  Also, because of the 
turbulent tidal flow within the inlet, conditions are generally well mixed, and 
the site can be maintained year round even through ice-over conditions in the 
rest of the bay.  Bottom sediments at this site are clean sands and gravels with 
almost no attached bottom vegetation. After a year of operation, we have noted 
that strong south to southeast (onshore) winds tend to produce turbidity events 
at this site from the wave induced suspension of fine sediments and organic 
material in the near-shore zone.  While we have found that these type of 
turbidity events are localized to windward near-shore areas in the bay, the 
transport of these sediments at inlet mouths during such times is perhaps a 
dominant sedimentation process within the estuarine system.  In other words 
while the choice of our location may be producing a localized signal in one of 
our measured parameters that signal may reflect key processes in the system at 
large. Salinity values for this site range from approximately 29 ppt to 33 ppt. 



6)	Data collection period:
Data loggers were first deployed on March 26,2001 at the Metoxit Point Site (MP) 
and on March 28, 2001 at the Menauhant Yacht Club Site (MH) when the ice conditions
subsided. Both Stations were in operation from these dates through the end of December.  
All monitoring is considered long-term.  Deployment dates and times for 2001 
are indicated below:

10)	 Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions:

All NERRS sites are required to use the following file naming convention.

File definitions:  YSI deployment site/month/year or SS/MM/YY
Our sites names are designated: 	a) Metoxit Point= MP
					      b) Menauhant Site= MH
Example:  MP0501 (designates monthly data from May 2001 at Metoxit Point Site)

11)	 Data anomalies:


March 2001

Metoxit Point:
a)	The datalogger was not deployed until March 26, 2001 (station data for 
2001 begins on 3/26/2001, 11:00:00).  There was no anomalous data found in the 
monthly file of March.

Menauhant:
a)	The data logger was not deployed until March 28, 20012001 (station data 
for 2001 begins on 3/28/2001, 16:30:00).
  
b)	BIOLOGICAL-RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: The following records include 
turbidity readings that were either outside of the normal range or spikes way 
above background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to biological factors (such as small fish, crabs, 
or other marine organisms), but are not associated with suspension events. Our 
criteria for flagging these data are single spikes (above rather constant 
background) over 50NTU that are more than 10 times surrounding values. These 
readings were deleted.

Metoxit Point:
a)	The following data points were lost while re-deploying the sonde.
04/10/2001	09:00:00		

b)	The following were all small negative and/or zero turbidity values 
(translated to 0000's), likely due to a small calibration error.  These data were 
not deleted.

Menauhant:
a)	SUSPENSION EVENT-Southeasterly Winds: The following records include 
turbidity readings that were either outside the normal range, or spikes way 
above background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  
These extreme values are likely due to large floating particles (i.e., seaweeds, 
detritus, etc.) during suspension events from southeasterly winds (see end of 
section 5 for more detail on these events at this site). Our criteria for 
flagging these data are values over 100NTU that are more than 5 times the 
magnitude of surrounding values, and linked to southeasterly winds.  These 
readings were deleted.

Menauhant:
a)	SUSPENSION EVENT-Channel Dredging/Easterly Winds: The following records 
include turbidity readings that were either outside the normal range, or spikes 
way above background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to large floating particles (i.e., seaweeds, 
detritus, etc.) during suspension events from dredging in the adjacent inlet 
channel that was occurring at this time. However, some of these data also 
occurred during a period of easterly wind and so there may be some contribution 
to the anomalies from wind as well. Our criteria for flagging these data are 
values over 100NTU that are more than 5 times the magnitude of surrounding 
values.  These readings were deleted.

in DO from 94.6% to 29.7% in one half hour then went back up to 94.8% again, for 
unknown reasons. Data were deleted.

Menauhant:
a)	SILO FOULING TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: The following records include turbidity 
readings that followed an unusual pattern of trending way above normal for 2-3 
days (to values over 100NTU) and then returning to "more normal" levels and 
repeating the cycle several days later. We believe these data cannot be 
explained by any real or ambient turbidity event (i.e., meteorological 
conditions were not conducive for significant suspension events) and subsequent 
deployment with a different sonde and sensor shows no similar pattern (and a 
large offset between the retrieved and replacement sensor turbidity values). Our 
current interpretation (3/2002) is that these signals were caused by some 
as yet unexplained temporary malfunctioning or fouling of the turbidity sensor. 
This situation may be due to a build-up of seaweeds in the sonde silo or probe 
casing. After the onset of the first such event during this deployment the data 
are considered suspect and so have been deleted.

July 2001

Metoxit Point:
a)	Deployment 7/3/2001 to 7/17/2001 had a large negative dissolved oxygen 
peak on 7/8/2001, caused by a catastrophic failure of the DO membrane (hole in 
membrane noted on post-check). All DO data from this deployment beginning with 
this membrane failure were deleted from the record from 07/08/01 09:30 through 
07/17/01 07:30.

c)	No Data were collected for 7/17/2001 08:00:00. This time fell during 
deployment/retrieval and no sonde was deployed for this reading.

d)	The YSI was accidentally dropped to the bottom of the bay during 
deployment on 7/17/2001 on or about 08:00:00 where it sat in the muck for part 
of the day, until it was redeployed properly later on the same day (16:00:00). 
All data during this several hour period from 07/17 08:30 - 15:30 of improper 
deployment were deleted. 


e)	Due to biological growth of algae and barnacles, we carried out a complete 
cleaning of the sonde silo and mooring in late afternoon on 7/17/2001.  At this 
time (7/17/01) the mooring was moved within the range of 10 feet or so from its 
previous location. Depth values for this station may be slightly offset 
from previous readings due to this move.

b)	DEPLOYMENT FAILURE:  On 8/19/01 in the mid afternoon the data shows that 
there was an unusual event at the site - perhaps a boat collision or other 
interference with the sonde and mooring.  On the date of retrieval (8/28/2001), 
the sonde silo and mooring were found tipped over and lying on its side on the 
bottom.  For this reason, all data following this event have been deleted (from 
8/19/01 13:30 to 8/28/01 14:00).

c)	On 8/28/2001 during retrieval/deployment, the Metoxit Point station was 
re-established, and the mooring and sonde silo were completely cleaned of 
fouling.  No data were collected for 2 hours from 8/28/2001, 14:30 to 8/28/2001, 
16:30 while this maintenance was carried out.

October 2001

Metoxit Point:
a)	BIOLOGICAL-RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: The following records include 
turbidity readings that were either outside of the normal range or spikes way 
above background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to biological factors (such as small fish, crabs, 
or other marine organisms), but are not associated with suspension events. Our 
criteria for flagging these data are single spikes (above rather constant 
background) over 50NTU that are more than 10 times surrounding values. These 
readings were deleted.

10/30/2001	05:00:00		0078


b)	SUSPENSION EVENT-Southerly Winds: The following records include turbidity 
readings that were either outside the normal range, or spikes way above 
background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  
These extreme values are likely due to large floating particles (i.e., seaweeds, 
detritus, etc.) during suspension events from southerly winds. Our criteria for 
flagging these data are values over 100NTU that are more than 5 times the 
magnitude of surrounding values, and linked to southerly winds.  These 
readings were deleted.

Menauhant:
a) When sonde was retrieved on 10/16/01 after its two week deployment, a 
small fish was found stuck within the probe casing. The turbidity data from 
10/13/01 02:00 until retrieval on 10/16/01 07:30 were way out of range.  When 
checked the turbidity wiper was found to be stuck over the aperture. All 
following turbidity data for the remainder of deployment period were deleted. 

b)	The DO probe membrane suffered a catastrophic failure on 10/3/01. All DO 
data for the remainder of this deployment period are deleted. 
10/03/01 21:00:00 to 10/16/01 07:30:00. 


c)	The following turbidity data were slightly negative and/or zero likely 
due to a slight offset during calibration. These readings were not deleted.

d)	BIOLOGICAL-RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: The following records include 
turbidity readings that were either outside of the normal range or spikes way 
above background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to biological factors (such as small fish, crabs, 
or other marine organisms), but are not associated with suspension events. Our 
criteria for flagging these data are single spikes (above rather constant 
background) over 50NTU that are more than 10 times surrounding values. These 
readings were deleted.

e) No data were recorded for 10/2/2001, 08:30:00 owing to 
retrieval/deployment operation (no sonde in the water at the time).

f)	The DO probe membrane suffered a catastrophic failure on 10/16/01. All DO 
data for the remainder of this deployment period are deleted. This 
period extends from 10/16/01 23:30:00 to 10/30/01 08:30:00.

Metoxit Point:
a) BIOLOGICAL-RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: The following records include 
turbidity readings that were either outside of the normal range or spikes way 
above background. We believe these are real enough numbers (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to biological factors (such as small fish, crabs, 
or other marine organisms), but are not associated with suspension events. Our 
criteria for flagging these data are single spikes (above rather constant 
background) over 50NTU that are more than 10 times surrounding values. These 
readings were deleted.

b)	There were several zero turbidity data from 12/05/01 21:00 - 12/31/01 
01:00 that were likely due to a slight offset during calibration. These readings 
were not deleted.
	
 
12)	 Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
section 11, Data Anomalies.  The Waquoit Bay NERR Research Coordinator can also 
be contacted about other issues concerning missing or anomalous data.

14)	Other remarks/notes: None
Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them. 

Our data is publicly available through our web site and we do not track its use.
