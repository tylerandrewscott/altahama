2) Entry verification

a) Data Input Procedures:
The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded 
from each instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X 
datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr30.csi) was loaded into the CR10X 
and controls the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then 
interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  

This software was located on a computer to which the data was uploaded (every 15 
minutes) via a short haul modem to a computer located at Tijuana Estuary 
Visitor's Center.  The data was saved as a raw data file (TJR.dat) on the 
hardrive.  Following download from the CR10x the data were automatically 
uploaded via FTP to a SQL server at San Diego State University and are available 
near real time via the internet.  The data are exported monthly from the SQL 
server into CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) to generate error logs 
(see section 2c for the CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data 
Criteria), summary reports and to create export files to be sent to the CDMO.  
The WDMP program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERR 
Meteorological Data Collection Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  Any anomalous data were investigated 
and are noted below in the Anomalous Data Section.  Any data corrections that 
were performed are noted in the Data Correction Section below.   All error 
messages and anomalous data were compared to reference data obtained from a 
nearby (1/2 mile) weather station operated by the NAVY.  Michelle Cordrey is 
responsible for all data QA/QC.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected 
with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 
2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) 
with the new data format found in version 4.0 (3 array output).  The new format 
produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), 
every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the 
daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  
With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to 
code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained 
in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were 
removed and left blank. 


b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and 
		precipitation data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 
		105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and 
		minimum with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation 	
		data which are 24 hour totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 
		245 and 246).

3) Research objectives (Campbell Weather Station):

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for the 
Tijuana Estuary in order to observe any environmental changes or trends over 
time. Samples were taken every 5 seconds and 15 minutes over roughly one week 
collecting intervals.  

4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both 
hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An 
instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 
150.   A one-week sampling interval was chosen so that the CR10X datalogger 
would not run out of room and overwrite data, especially if the short haul modem 
link failed and data could not be automatically sent from the datalogger to the 
computer.  If this were the case, the data would have to be downloaded at the 
storage module to a laptop or the storage module would be replaced and brought 
back to the lab for uploading following procedures in Part D. Section 4.5 of the 
CDMO Operations Manual.  Periodically, sensors on the weatherstation are 
inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned.   
Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at 
minimum of every two years.  There were no other analyses done on the 
meteorological data at present.  

5) Site location and character:

The Tijuana River NERR is located on the Southern Pacific Coast, next to the 
California border with Mexico at a latitude of 32 deg. 34 min. N and Longitude 
of 117 deg. 07 min. W.  The area surrounding the 2,531 acre reserve is heavily 
developed by residential housing as is the watershed which drains into the 
estuary.  Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico and is subject to 
periodic raw sewage outflows.  The North Eastern section of is bordered by a 
military helicopter training base.  Vegetation in the area is dominated by 
common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) and Pacific cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).

The area is characterized by very dry summers with most rainfall occuring
between November and March. Prevailing winds are primarily off the ocean
from the west during daylight hours, lighter breezes from the land generally
occur after the sun has set. During the fall "Santa Ana" winds can occur
which results in sharp increases in temperature caused by winds blowing from
the Mojave Dessert and decreased humidity (15% or less).  Thunderstorms are
not common but can occur during the winter in association with cold fronts.

Descriptions of the specific sampling station follows:

The weather station is located approximately 30m west of the TR NERR Visitor 
Centor at a Latitude of 32deg 34min 28.32sec N and a Longitude of 117deg 07min 
37.05sec W.  The station is 50m north of the water quality sampling station.  
The vegetation surrounding the weather station are mainly upland scrub species.
	
The anemometer, wind direction and Licor sensors are located at the top of 
a 3.5 meter aluminum tower.  The temperature and humidity sensors are located 
midway up and on the west side of the tower. The Tipping Bucket rain gauge sits 
on a separate 2 meter high pole located approx. a meter to the west of the main 
tower. It is above the ground to limit interference from the security fence 
surrounding the weather station.  The sensors were wired to the CR10X following 
the NERR SWMP Meteorological SOP.  

6) Data collection period:
Weather data collection began at the Tidal Linkage station in 1999.

The malfuntion in the wind sensor was caused by a short in the cable that
resulted in wind direction values that ranged from 0 to 45 degrees only. The
sensor cable was replaced on 8/23/2002 at about 2pm.  All wind direction values 
prior to the installation of the new cable were deleted and replaced with 55555.

13) Other remarks:

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected 
with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 
2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) 
with the new data format found in version 4.0 (3 array output).  The new format 
produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), 
every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the 
daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  
With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to 
code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained 
in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were 
removed and left blank. 

The malfuntion in the wind sensor was caused by a short in the cable that
resulted in wind direction values that ranged from 0 to 45 deg. only. The
sensor cable was replaced on 8/23/2002 at about 2pm.
