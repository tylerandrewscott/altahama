2.  Entry Verification:
The data is directly downloaded in a spreadsheet format from the YSI 6000 upg 
datalogger to a PC.  Edited files are created by removing the headers, footers, 
and spaces on a PC.  Missing data from YSI 6000 maintenance (downtime) is 
inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Data and graphs 
are visually inspected to find possible anomalies.  Edited and raw files 
are currently stored on 3.5-inch diskettes.  [Edited and raw data will be 
archived and stored on IBM 41T workstation].  Data files were QA/QC'd using 
Excel 5.0 CDMO macros. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file 
from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis.   
Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged 
monthly files are also transferred to NERRS Central Data Management Office.  
Mike Mensinger and Lonnie Dye are responsible 
for the editing and archiving of these data.

3.  Research Objectives:
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for Delaware Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water 
quality over time. The three sites chosen for monitoring will assist in 
understanding the impacts of both urban and agricultural impacts on the 
watersheds.  Scotton Landing and Penrose Branch are located within the St. Jones 
River watershed, while the northern Blackbird Landing component is located in 
the Blackbird Creek watershed. The St. Jones River is impacted by urbanization 
upstream and extensive agricultural activity throughout the basin. The Blackbird 
Creek is one of the least impacted riverine systems in Delaware.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes over two week collecting periods at the Scotton 
Landing (SL), Blackbird Landing (BL) and Penrose Branch (PB) sites.


4.  Research Methods:
The YSI 6000 datalogger monitoring program was started in July 1995 at Scotton 
Landing (St. Jones River) and Blackbird Landing (Blackbird Creek).  In June 1996 
Penrose Branch (St. Jones River Basin) was added to the monitoring program.  
Prior to deployment, a 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC pipe was mounted to a piling 
at Scotton Landing and a bridge at Blackbird Landing and Penrose Branch using 
stainless steel brackets and bolts.  Each YSI 6000 is lowered into the PVC pipe 
that has eight (8) two-inch diameter holes cut out at the bottom for the probes 
to have direct contact with the water column.  A large stainless steel bolt 
was placed at the bottom end of the PVC pipe which maintained each YSI 6000 at 
each site exactly one foot (30 cm) above the river bottom.  Every half-hour over 
a two-week period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and water level are recorded.  
Seven days after the deployment of each YSI 6000, the dissolved oxygen membrane 
is cleaned with a Kimwipe dipped in methanol.  Two-week sampling intervals were 
selected due to limitations created by the dissolved oxygen membrane. At the end 
of each two-week period, the YSI 6000 is brought back to the office for 
downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Calibrations performed include: 
dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity using Oakton 12,880 uS standard, 
turbidity using AMCO AEPO-1 Standard at 100 NTU and distilled water, pH using 
Fisher pH 4.00, 7.00 and 10.00 buffers, and depth.  These procedures are carried 
out according to the methods as described in the YSI Model 6000 Operating and 
Service Manual.  After approximately six hours of down time for cleaning and 
recalibration, the YSI 6000's are redeployed for another two-week period. Data 
files are QA/QC'd using Excel 5.0 CDMO macros.  Edited files are merged to 
contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged monthly files are also 
transferred to NERRS Central Data Management Office.

5.  Site location and character:
The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component 
sites, the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are 
located along the Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located 
in central Kent County Delaware, east of the State Capitol City, Dover.  The 
Blackbird Creek component is located in the unincorporated area of Southern New 
Castle County.  There are three sampling sites, two located in St. Jones 
component and one in the Blackbird Creek component.

1) Scotton Landing - is located in the Lower St. Jones River at the Scotton 
Landing Public Fishing Pier, just up stream of Delaware Route 113.  The river is 
22.3 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an average depth of 4m MHW and 
the width is 50 m. At the sampling site, the depth is 3.2 m MHW and the width is 
40 m. The sediment is clayey silt with no bottom vegetation. The watershed-
draining site is 19778 ha. The site is influenced by freshwater runoff from the 
relatively urbanized area upstream. 
	Salinity ranges from 1- 30 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) - 1.26
	Neap Mean (m) - 1.13
	Position:  Latitude     39 degree 05'  05.9160"  N
          	     Longitude  75 degree 27'  38.1049"  W
2) Blackbird Landing - is located in the upper Blackbird Creek at Blackbird 
Landing Road.  The creek is 25.8 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an 
average depth of 3 m MHW, and an average width of 90 m. At the sampling site, 
the depth is 1.8 m MHW and width is 110 m. The sediment is silty clay with no 
bottom vegetation. The watershed draining site is 4694 ha. The site is 
influenced by freshwater runoff from unimpacted forested areas intermixed with 
agricultural land uses and a small amount of low-density development.  
	Salinity ranges from 0-9 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) - 1.12
	Neap Mean (m) - 1.13
      Position:  Latitude      39 degree 23'  19.5196"  N
		     Longitude   75 degree 38'  09.5882"  W
3) Penrose Branch - is located in the headwaters of the St. Jones Basin, north 
of Dover and along Pearsons Corner Road.  The branch is 4.7 km long. The bottom 
habitat consists of leaf litter and lower portions of emergent aquatic 
vegetation. At the sampling site, the depth is .1 m and width is 6 m. The 
watershed draining site is 620 ha. The site is predominately a forested wetland 
tributary system with agricultural land uses along the subcatchments fringe.  
	Salinity is 0.00 ppt.
	Tidal Range: Not Applicable, freshwater 
	Position:	Latitude      39 degree 09'  52.77"  N

publication in open literature, including refereed scientific journals, will 
acknowledge that the research was conducted under an award from the Estuarine 
Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National 
Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The data set 
enclosed within this packet/transmission is only as good as the quality 
assurance and quality control procedures outlined by the enclosed metadata 
reporting statement. The user bears all responsibility for its subsequent 
use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons. The Federal government does 
not assume liability to the Recipient of third persons, nor will the Federal 
government reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for its liability due to any 
losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under general information 
link on CDMO homepage) and online at the CDMO homepage 
http://inlet.geol.sc.edu/cdmohome.html. Data are available in text tab-delimited 
format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format, and comma-delimited format.
		
8.  Associated researchers and projects: 
An extensive stormwater sampling and hydrodynamic modeling project is underway 
in the upper reaches of the St. Jones River Basin.  This project includes flow 
weighted stormwater sampling to quantify pollutant loads from each of the major 
land uses found in the Basin.An additional stormwater sampling program is 
underway to analyze the impact of agricultural BMP's at sites in the Blackbird 
Creek Watershed, St. Jones River Watershed.A joint effort underway through 
NOAA's Center for Coastal Ecosystem Health and the DNERR characterization 
studies will initiate detailed monthly water quality sampling at three sites in 
each river over a two year period and will quantify the phytoplankton community 
with collections from the same sites.   This project was scheduled to be 
initiated in February 1995.(See Section I.1. for research contacts.)

12. Missing Data
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.). To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks/Notes

a) The file used for Blackbird (April and May) 050801.csv was altered. Readings 
were 15 minutes behind, so all time altered back 15 minutes to allow file to 
import. File with alterations was named blwq050801.csv and sent to CDMO as raw 
data file.
