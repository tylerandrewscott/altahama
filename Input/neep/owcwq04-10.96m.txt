2. Entry verification:

		The data were directly downloaded from the YSI data loggers into the 
YSI PC6000 program in the PC. The data were graphed and visually checked for any 
obvious outliers. The data were then transferred to an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and spaces.  CDMO Excel 
macros were used to format the data, to check for outliers and determine missing 
dates and times, which were then added to the data file.  Missing data were 
inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods. The data files were then 
checked for readings that were outside the instrument range.  These data were 
removed and replaced with a period. An explanation for the missing and the 
deleted data is included in this meta data sheet.  The files were then 
transfered along with the associated metadata sheet by disk to the CDMO.  The 
files are archived at OWC. Dr. David Klarer is responsible for both data logger 
deployment and data management.

3.Research Objectives:

		Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two week 
periods at two sites within the Old Woman Creek estuary- one in the upper 
reaches at State Route 2 and the other near the mouth, just south of State Route 
6. The purpose of this monitoring program is to document the role of Great Lakes 
estuaries in mitigating storm flow that passes through them.  

4. Research methods:

	The YSI monitoring program began on 25 April, 1996 at both sites.  Prior 
to deployment of the data loggers, a 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was bolted to a 
metal sign post that had been driven into the sediment.  Each pipe had 4 rows of 
holes drilled into it spanning the area of the probe guard on the data logger so 
that the probes would have direct contact with the surrounding waters.  The data 
logger at site SU is .18 meters above the bottom, while the YSI at site WM is 
0.05 meters above the bottom.  Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity, and 
specific conductance readings are taken when the instrument is pulled at each 
site. On alternate weeks, the data loggers are pulled.  The data is retrieved 
from each data logger and each data logger is recalibrated (according to the 
directions in the YSI Operations Manual)  before being returned to the field.  
Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and specific conductance readings are taken 
when the instrument is pulled at each site. On alternate weeks, the data loggers 
are pulled.  The data is retrieved from each data logger and each data logger is 
recalibrated (according to the directions in the YSI Operations Manual)  before 
being returned to the field.  Conductivity, pH (2 point calibration), and 
turbidity (2 point calibration) were calibrated using commercial standards.

5. Site location and character:

	Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
southern shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio (Latitude 
41 22' N; longitude 82 31' W). 
	The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) 41 22’ 57” N, 82 30’ 52” W site 
is very near the southern boundary of the reserve.  The data logger is sited 
near a concrete piling of the eastbound Ohio State Route 2 bridge.  At this site 
the creek is relatively deep and narrow.  Although water direction and flow is 
influenced at this site by changes in Lake Erie water levels, this site doesn't 
have direct contact with Lake Erie waters. 
	The data logger at State Route 6 (WM) 41 22’ 56” N, 82 30’ 26” W is very 
close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In this portion of the Reserve, the 
creek is very shallow but extends over a large surface area.  This site  
frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie waters.  

6. Data collection periods:

	Sampling at WM began on April 25, 1996 at 09:15:00.  Sampling for 1995 
ceased at WM site on October 31, 1996 at 23:45:00.  Sampling at SU began on 
April 25, 1996 at 15:30:00.  Sampling ceased at SU site on October 31, 1996 at 
23:45:00.

7. Associated projects:

	There were no projects directly associated with the datalogger project.

10. Data anomalies:

 April 1996: 
WM:  Turbidity on 04/25/96  (09:15:00)-data deleted due to sediment 
resuspension caused when installing data logger

May 1996:
WM: Turbidity 05/08/96 (08:15:00) through 05/20/96 (08:45:00)- probe malfunction
DO levels from 05/24/96 (13:45:00) to 05/31/96 (23:45:00) deleted because 
of oxygen probe failure; DO values from 5/20/96 (09:00:00) through 5/24/96 (13:30:00)
questionable due to high variability in values.  


WM: Turbidity from 05/22/96 (12:15:00) through 05/31/96 (23:45:00) very 
erratic perhaps due to problems of the wiper parking over the optics during some of the

An anomalous spike in specific conductivity/salinity occurred on 5/20/96 (09:15:00). Unknown
what caused spike, therefore, data was retained.
