2. Entry verification:
 	After retrieving and carefully cleaning the dataloggers, they are examined to detect any structural 
damage to the body or to the probes. The DO membrane is checked for ruptures and then replaced if 
needed. The turbidity probe is examined to assure that no obstruction affects the wiper and that the sensor 
is clean. Manipulation and observation are registered in the field log for each deployment respectively.
	The YSI is connected to a Pentium II 400 MHz IBM compatible computer and the data are 
reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowatch for Windows that accompanies the YSI 6000 
datalogger. The file is uploaded in two formats, one in YSI PC6000 format and the other in Comma 
Delimited format then the file is renamed to have a ".txt" extension. The YSI Ecowatch for Windows 
program is used to plot the data and delete the pre- and post deployment data that are not in range of the 
other readings. The program is used to perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.). 
Data is initially reviewed using the Ecowatch graphing tool. Data for a month is compiled into one single 
Excel 97 data sheet for further examination to detect gross outliers, data recorded during instrument 
retrieval or caused by instrument failure. 
	Missing dates and times are checked before submitting the data to the Centralized Data 
Management Office. CDMO Excel macros are provided to assist in data review and data editing. Data is 
opened into this program and empty or unrecorded data spaces are filled with periods. Columns are 
formatted to have a specific size and specific number of decimal place holders as specified by the NERR 
CDMO.  Date and time readings are also checked and outliers are identified. The outliers file is saved and 
printed for revision of each file.  Missing data and explanatory reasons are recorded in the metadata 
missing data section. 
	Data that was found to be out of the instrument range or normal parameters for each sampling 
station is removed from the file and a period is inserted to the cell (s). Explanation for changes in data is 
also included in the metadata. Data that were outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular 
site is investigated for validity based on filed observation, QC check, Ecowatch for Windows printouts, and 
the instrument diagnostics. The metadata form is submitted with the data to the CDMO. Data is stored in 
zip disks. Dr. Pedro Robles, Research Coordinator, is responsible for data management. 
 
3. Research Objectives:
  	Three dataloggers are deployed at Mar Negro area, major component of Jobos Bay Estuarine 
Research Reserve, and are suspended from a pole at 0.3 meter from the bottom of the selected site. Only 
data from stations 9 and 10 will be submitted to the Centralized Data Management Office as part of the 
System-Wide Monitoring Program. Measurements are taken in thirty (30) minute intervals for 
approximately two-week periods. The sites are identified as representative of areas within the reserve and 
comparable to the sites that may be receiving impact from human activities in the surroundings areas.
	Station number nine (9), the impacted site, collects water quality data in a site associated with 
runoff from littoral and basin mangroves areas. This sampling station is closer to the Electric Power 
Thermoelectric Plant, which makes it subject to runoff and potential spills contamination from this 
industrial facility. Information compiled from historical environmental documents indicate that station nine 
(9) was used as a disposal site for the residues of the previously operating sugar mill operation, which 
might have been a high organic input to the sediments.
	Station number ten (10), located in the mangrove lagoon area is the reference or non-impacted 
site.

4.	Research methods:
 	The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring began on December 20, 1995 at Station nine (9), 
February 1, 1996 at Station ten (10). At this time we are only performing long term water quality 
monitoring.
	Before each YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed following 
the manufacturer's instruction (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections 3,4 and 7). Calibration standards are 
only required for pH, salinity, and turbidity, all other parameters are done as described in the manual. 
Buffer solutions for two-point calibration (pH 7 and pH 10) are purchased from a scientific supply house. 
Salinity is calibrated via a specific conductance standard 1000 µs/cm and is purchased from a scientific 
supply house.  This solution is also prepared in the laboratory of Department of Natural and Environmental 
Resources (DNER) utilizing KCl following specification of EPA methods.
	The two-point turbidity calibration (as of January 01, 1997) was performed using a 0 NTU 
standard using lab grade DI water made at the DNER laboratory and 40 NTU standard purchased from a 
scientific supply house. We are now using (since Jan 01, 1997) a 200 NTU standard purchased from a 
scientific company. The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to 
sit at least 24 hours prior to deployment.
	The weather conditions and tide stage during deployment are recorded in the field observation log. 
Measurements of DO, pH, salinity, specific conductance, temperature, are taken with other calibrated field 
instruments to check the accuracy of the instrumentation.
	Each YSI datalogger is tied with steel cable to a wrought iron galvanized pole, which is plunged 
into the sediments of each sampling area.  Dataloggers are suspended from a pole at 0.3 meter from the 
bottom of the selected site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period measurements are taken for date, 
time, temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen 
concentration, depth, pH, and turbidity. Every two weeks the dataloggers are retrieved, uploaded, cleaned, 
inspected, and calibrated as noted previously. The datalogger is then ready to be deployed.

5. Site location and character:
 	The Jobos Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (JOBNERR) is located on the southern 
coastal plain of the island of Puerto Rico, a reserve within the West Indies geographical area. JOBNERR is 
composed of two major areas: (1) Mar Negro, located on the western margin of the Bay, and (2) Cayos 
Caribe, a chain of 15 tear-shaped islets located to the southeast. The Mar Negro area comprises the bulk of 
the Reserve, and consists of mangrove forests and a complex system of lagoons and channels interspersed 
with salt and mud flats.  Coral reefs and seagrass beds, with small beach deposits and upland areas fringe 
Cayos Caribe mangrove islands.
 	Station 9 is an impacted site and is located at the northeastern part of the Mar Negro unit. The 
sampling station is associated with the mangrove lagoon area and received the Thermoelectric Power Plant 
runoff through mudflats and areas adjacent. The tidal range varies from 12 in. to 14 in. in the vicinity of the 
monitoring station.  No fresh water input in the vicinity of the station is probable. The salinity at the 
vicinity of the monitoring station varies from 0.0 ppt to 41.1 ppt.  The station pole is located at 17° 56' 
36.8" N and 66° 14' 18.5" W.
 	Station 10 is located in a mangrove lagoon not impacted from upland or marine activities. It 
provided a reference for comparison of the data obtained in other stations, especially to the stations in Mar 
Negro lagoon environment.  The tidal range varies from 12 in. to 14 in. in the vicinity of the monitoring 
station.  No fresh water input in the vicinity of the station is probable. The salinity at the vicinity of the 
monitoring station varies from 0.0 ppt to 41.7 ppt.  The pole is located at 17° 56' 20.3" N and 66° 45' 26.7" 
W.
 	Station 11 datalogger is tied to a small pier stand in the westernmost lagoon in the Mar Negro unit. 
Although a chain from a small pier suspends this datalogger, and it has been deployed at the same depth of 
the other dataloggers. Non point sources of contaminants from residences and boating activities in the 
vicinity are probable. The lagoon is characterized by dark bottom, tidal range from 12 in. to 14 in., 
allegedly related to long-term deposition of organic wastes from the sugar mill operation when the mill was 
operating. No fresh water input in the vicinity of the station is probable. The salinity at the vicinity of the 
monitoring station varies from 0.0 ppt to 36.7 ppt.  The datalogger is suspended by a chain and localized at 
17° 56' 41.8" N and 66° 15' 46.0" W.
 	Data from stations 9 and 10 are the only one to be submitted to the CDMO. Of five sondes we 
have, two will be permanently devoted to take reading from this two sites, while other two will serve as 
replacement when sondes are taken out of the water for data upload and maintenance. This will avoid data 
gaps for station 9 and 10 between sonde maintenance procedures. Data collected by station 11 will not be 
submitted because of gaps that will result at sonde retrieval for data uploading and maintenance. All 
monitoring is considered long term.
 
6. Data collection period: 
 	Station nine (9) sampling with the YSI began on December 20, 1995.
	Station ten (10) sampling with the YSI began on February 1, 1996.
	 
7. Associated researchers and projects:
	A water quality and plankton monitoring scheme was initiated in 1995, to monitor 12 stations in 
the Jobos Bay system. This effort, conducted by the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources 
Laboratory began in March 1995, using a Hydrolab Data sonde 3 with a Surveyor 3 readout system, 
monitoring the water column on a bimonthly time basis for abiotic parameter similar to the YSI. Monthly 
samples for nutrients, plankton and chlorophyll were conducted from March to October (Water Quality 
Monitoring-Spatial and temporal variations of main abiotic and plankton components in JOBNERR, 1996). 
Samplings were resumed in January 1996 and will be conducted until March 1997).

12. Other remarks
Several files were lost when our hard disk crashed. In most occasions a file had information that was part of 
two months. Backup copies were available for most files but not all. 

During the following date and times, depth was recorded in feet instead of meters.  Data were later 
converted to meters for Station 10 on the following dates: 
1/22/99 16:00  02/16/99 09:00
04/01/99 00:00  04/07/99 09:00
