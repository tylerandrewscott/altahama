2. Entry verification:
Data were uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 and graphs were produced and 
examined using the PC 6000 software. Data were also uploaded in a comma-
delimited format from the YSI to the PC. Edited files were created by removing 
headers, footers, and spaces on a PC in Excel 5.0. Suspect data were evaluated 
using QA/QC Excel 5.0 macros (version 3.0) from CDMO. Missing data from YSI 
maintenance were inserted into the spreadsheet and were denoted by periods (.). 
Edited files were merged to create one full month of data. Edited and raw data 
were archived at Elkhorn Slough NERR, then uploaded to CDMO NERR server. John 
Haskins, is responsible for the editing and archiving of data.

3. Research objectives:
Non-point source pollution is among the highest research priorities within the 
Elkhorn Slough watershed. Agriculture and specifically strawberry production, is 
a significant land use in the watershed, with agricultural production making up 
one quarter of land use and strawberries comprising about 8% of the Elkhorn 
Slough watershed.  Agricultural runoff has led to high concentrations of 
nutrients and some pesticides in the slough.  Several studies have shown that 
agricultural practices have an impact on the species composition and ecological 
processes in Elkhorn Slough.  Two sites within the slough water are being 
monitored.  One site (SM) is in the Reserve at the edge of the channel next to a 
Salicornia marsh that is surrounded by a mixture of native and introduced 
grasses and shrubs in the uplands.  This is a relatively pristine location with 
minimal inputs of agricultural runoff.  Azevedo Pond (AP), the second site, is 
surrounded by strawberry fields with a very narrow (about 3 m) fringe of marsh.  
The farm surrounding the pond is part of a project to develop best management 
practices and new growing techniques.  

4. Research methods: 
The Elkhorn Slough water-monitoring program began on June 26, 1995. Both sites 
described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI deployment at SM, a 
20 foot length of 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the slough to house the 
YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the pipe's surface area and 
to allow waterflow across the YSI. The pipe was positioned vertically in the 
slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom sediments and the other end 
secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) 
above the bottom.Prior to YSI deployment at AP, a supportive framework of rope 
and PVC was placed at the site to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI 
exactly one foot (30cm) above the pond bottom. Every 15 minutes over a 30-day 
period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature, depth, and pH are recorded. 30 day periods were chosen due to the 
limitations of the dissolved oxygen membrane and battery power. 
	At the end of each 30 day period, the YSI is brought back into the lab for 
downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Data is downloaded on PC and graphs 
are printed using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde body and probes are  cleaned.  DO 
membrane is changed and allowed to re-equilibrate for at least one hour before 
calibration.  Calibration is as outlined in the user manual.  Buffer solutions 
of pH 7 and pH 10 are purchased from a scientific supply house and used for two 
point calibration.  A salinity standard of 32.035 ppt is also purchased and used 
for calibration. After approximately four hours of down time, the YSIs are 
redeployed for another 30 days.

5. Site location and character:
Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in Central 
California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay near Moss 
Landing, California.  The Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve 
encompasses about 1400 acres on the south and east side of the slough.  A range 
of habitats is represented from uplands of oak and grassland, to saltmarsh, 
tidal mudflat, and open water.  The tidal range in Elkhorn Slough is 
approximately 2 meters. Annually, surface salinity varies between 4.2-40.5 psu 
at the head of the slough, between 15.4-34.7 psu in the mid region and between 
14.5-34.0 psu at the mouth.  Elkhorn Slough is a seasonal estuary with the major 
freshwater inputs during the winter rainy season.  Carneros Creek empties into 
the head of the slough and has significant flow between December and April.  
Periodic freshwater inputs from the Salinas River to Elkhorn Slough occur when 
the mouth of the Salinas River is closed and flow is diverted through the old 
channel which empties into the mouth of Elkhorn Slough.YSI datasondes are 
deployed at two sampling sites: South Marsh (SM) and Azevedo Pond (AP).  SM (36° 
49'N, 121° 44'W) is in a side channel of the slough on the Elkhorn Slough 
National Estuarine Research Reserve.   The major runoff to this site is from 
grasslands and uplands on the Reserve and is relatively unimpacted by 
anthropogenic influences.  Water depth at this site is approximately 2 meters 
and bottom sediments are silty-clays.  The adjacent intertidal mudflats are 
often colonized by macroalgae such as Ulva and Enteromorpha.  AP (36° 50'N, 121° 
45'W) is in a pond which receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from a 
strawberry field in year-round production. The YSI is located about 10m from a 
culvert connecting the pond to the slough.  Two culverts restrict the tidal 
range within the pond to 0.5 m.  Water depth of the sonde is approximately 1 
meter.  Bottom sediments are mainly organic rich silts.  Extensive mats of 
macroalgae (Ulva and Enteromorpha) occur within the pond.

6. Data collection period:
Sampling at both sites began simultaneously on June 26, 1995 and data collection 
is ongoing. 

7. Associated researchers and projects:
Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough 
Foundation have had an ongoing program to monitor estuarine water quality in the 
central Monterey Bay region since 1988.  Currently, 24 stations are monitored 
monthly for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, nitrate, 
ammonium and dissolved inorganic phosphate concentrations.  Two of these 
stations  on the Reserve are about 400 m from the SM site.  Data collection 
began at these two stations in September 1989.  A monthly monitoring station is 
also located at Azevedo Pond within 10 m of the YSI deployment.  Monthly data 
from the Azevedo Pond are available from March 1992.
	The University of California Santa Cruz Agroecology Program has an ongoing 
project to examine the effects of agricultural production on an adjacent 
wetland.  Matthew Werner, Marc Los Huertos, Felecia Rein, Sean Swezey, Mark 
Silberstein, Andrew De Vogelaere, Ron Tjeerdema have been the principal 
investigators.  They have made a detailed baseline characterization of wetlands 
and an adjacent field under chemically-intensive strawberry production.  The 
Monterey Bay Regional Studies Program at UCSC awarded graduate fellowships to 
Marc Los Huertos and Felecia Rein to study the effects of native vegetation 
buffer zones on movement of sediment and agricultural run-off.  The overall 
goals of this program are to test alternative farming practices that can 
mitigate negative effects on wetlands while providing a sustainable livelihood 
for farmers.  This research is occurring on the Azevedo Ranch in a pond and 
pocket marsh adjacent to the AP YSI deployment site.
	Nicole Beck from the University of California Santa Cruz is investigating 
the role of diel oxygen fluctuations in controlling redox cycles and nutrient 
balances in Azevedo Pond at the AP YSI deployment site.  This research examines 
how changes in tidal flushing over an annual cycle within the pond affects 
dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, and the iodate/iodide couple (an indicator 
of redox conditions).
	Bess Ward from the University of California Santa Cruz is investigating 
several aspects of the ecology of nitrifying bacteria in Elkhorn Slough.  These 
projects include: characterizing and identifying the nitrifier community and 
monitoring seasonal changes in bacterial numbers, productivity and activity of 
nitrifying bacteria at 3 sites in Elkhorn Slough.  One of those sites is a pond 
on the Azevedo Ranch adjacent to the AP YSI deployment site.
