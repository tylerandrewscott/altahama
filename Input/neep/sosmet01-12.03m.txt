2)	Entry verification 
a) Data Input Procedures:

The CDMO Data Logger Program was loaded into a Campbell Scientific Instruments (CSI) 
CR10X datalogger station located on the weather tower.  The program controls the sensors, 
storing meteorological information sampled every 5 seconds from each instrument on the 
CR10X.  Data are output to a file in three arrays: array 15 stores 15 minute average, max and 
min data; array 60 stores hourly average, max and min data; and array 144 stores daily 
average, max and min data.  The CR10X interfaces with the PC208W software supplied by 
CSI.  The station is hardwired into the Estuarine and Coastal Science laboratory IBM-
compatible PC where CSI’s Real-Time Data Management Program refreshes the numeric 
output on screen every 5 seconds.  Visual checks of station performance are noted 
continuously throughout the workday.  The 15-minute, 1-hour, and 24-hour array data are 
automatically updated to a file on the computer every 15 minutes.  The data are saved as a 
monthly raw data file (i.e., cmstn0103month.dat) onto a separate hard drive and backed up on 
two computers.
      
Data were processed in two ways.  From 01/01/03 through 10/19/03, the CDMO Weather 
Data Management Program (WDMP) was used to process a month of data.  The WDMP was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of 
the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP converts the 
comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access database; checks the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see section 2c); and produces error and summary reports.  
Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any 
data corrections that were performed are documented in the Data Correction section.  
      
The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank. 
 
A new program (NERR_4.csi) was uploaded on 10/20/03, and after that time, files were 
exported from PC208W in a comma-delimited format (.dat). The files were opened in MS 
Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro which was developed by CDMO to 
reformat the header columns, insert station codes, insert a date column (mm/dd/yyy), correct 
the time column format, and reformat the data to the appropriate number of decimal places.  
The data were then copied into the EQWin weather.eqi file where the data were checked and 
archived in a database.  EQWin queries, reports, and graphs were used to determine data 
outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to measure) and 
large changes in the data.  EQWin was also used to generate statistics, view graphs, create 
customized queries and reports of the data, cross query the water, weather, and nutrient data, 
and finally export the data to the CDMO.  Any anomalous data corrections that were 
performed are noted in the Data Anomalies/Corrections below (Section 11).  

Sue Powell has been responsible for the weather station since 2001, including QA/QC 
processing of the data and compiling the metadata.

3)	Research objectives: 

The South Slough NERR operates the SWMP Meteorological Station to provide continuous 
measurements of local weather conditions affecting the South Slough estuary.  The nearest 
National Weather Service certified station is located at the North Bend Airport, 11.5 km NE 
from the mouth of South Slough.  At that location, the weather observers’ primary function is 
to provide current meteorological information to pilots.  Only 24-hour weather data is 
recorded, including maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and prevailing wind 
direction.
      
Because the SWMP weather station is located at the mouth of South Slough, recorded data 
provides information more pertinent to the microclimates affecting the estuary.  The principal 
objective is to record long-term meteorological data for South Slough in order to observe any 
environmental changes or trends over time.  In addition, the station provides real-time data to 
assess the short-term effects of local weather.  The station is part of a framework to evaluate 
the relative contributions of oceanic forcing and watershed inputs to hydrodynamics, nutrient 
dynamics, and other ecological processes within the South Slough estuary.  Data were 
recorded every 5 seconds and 15 minutes over approximately 2-week collecting intervals. 

4)	Research methods: 

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce 15 minute, hourly and 
daily averages of Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Rainfall, Wind 
Speed, and Wind Direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and those 
data are stored in array 150 (until 10/19/03) or array 15 (after 10/20/03).  Array 60 stores 
hourly averages, and max and min data; and array 144 stores daily average, and max and min 
data.  The data are automatically downloaded to a PC in the laboratory via a local network 
link.  A 4MB storage module was installed on 10/20/03 to increase the capacity of the 
CR10X data storage.  In case the direct network line fails, a Palm Pilot (m105) or a laptop 
computer can be used to download data.  

The sensors are inspected monthly for damage or fouling and the solar panels, PAR sensor, 
and the rain gauge are cleaned.  A Kestrel 4000 handheld is used as a general check of the 
sensors as well as a sling psychrometer for an additional relative humidity comparison.  Back 
in the laboratory, data as close as possible to the field check are downloaded from the nearby 
North Bend Weather Station and compared to station data. The Spike Needle Strips (Bird-X, 
Inc.) that were installed on a frame around the rain gauge to prevent bird roosting have been 
very effective.  Annually, all sensors are calibrated on site by Robb Hibbs of MeasureTek, 
Inc.  Data recorded during station maintenance are deleted. 

5)	Site location and character: 

South Slough is characterized as a drowned river-mouth estuary.  Located five miles 
southwest of Coos Bay, Oregon, South Slough is one of seven tidal inlets that collectively 
form the Coos estuary.  The South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is 
representative of the mid-Pacific portion of the Lower Columbian Bioregion, extending from 
Cape Mendocino, CA north to the Columbia River, OR.  The Reserve includes 4,700 acres 
with 600 acres of tidal marshes, mudflats and open water channels.
      
Within the South Slough, there are three primary sub-systems that provide much of the 
freshwater input to the area.  Only two sub-systems, the Sengstacken and Winchester arms, 
are within Reserve boundaries.  The Sengstacken arm drains a semi-pristine area with no 
development and serves as a reference site for the riverine portion of the estuary.  The 
Winchester arm is similarly located in an area with development limited to one small farm 
(<10 cattle) high in the watershed.  The area functions as a management-treatment site for 
salt marsh restoration activities in the Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project.  Valino 
Island marks the northern boundary of the Reserve and is a marine-dominated area.

Charleston Meteorological Station:  [43deg 20.703’ N, 124deg 19.724’ W]
The station is located 1.2 kms northwest of the Charleston water quality monitoring site.  A 
10-meter tall navigation tower that formerly belonged to the Corps of Engineers is situated 
on the northeast corner of the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology campus.  The tower is 
about 20 meters from the inner boat marina at Charleston harbor.  Three 12-13 meter tall 
shore pines lie directly south of the tower and may slightly shelter the station from southerly 
winds, but the sensor array is never shaded.  The weather station is above the nearest 
building, which is about 8 meters away.  A 40-meter-tall forested ridge that has a northeast to 
southwest alignment is located about 60 meters from the weather tower and may interfere 
with winds from the southwest.  On the tower platform, a 3-meter tall mast holds the Wind 
Sentry, Temperature and Humidity, Barometric, and LiCor sensors array and the CR-10.  
Because there is no open field available, the Rain Gauge is set on top of a platform on the 
southwest corner of the tower.  Other sensor placement is in accordance with the NERR SWMP
Campbell Scientific CR10X Based Meteorological Monitoring Station Standard Operating Procedure.
      
Safety apparatus for ascending the tower is in accordance with OSHA regulations.  A sliding 
trolley runs in a track during ascension of the ladder.  The trolley is connected by a carabiner 
to a chest harness and belt.  While working on the tower platform, a 4-meter-long tether 
secures the person to a tower strut.  

6)	Data collection period: 

The Charleston station was installed on 08/21/01.  The station is hard-wired to the SWMP 
laboratory in 2002 and the data are downloaded automatically.  The WordPad program is 
used to divide the data into individual months.  Data were collected for the entire year in 
2003.

7)	Distribution

According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy for 
the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program:
NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of the 
NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program data.  The PI retains the right to be fully 
credited for having collected and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy 
standards, the PI and NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and 
fully acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any part of the data are 
used.  Manuscripts resulting from the NOAA/OCRM-supported research that are

8)	Associated researchers and projects: 

The South Slough NERR maintains four water quality monitoring stations along the estuarine 
gradient within the South Slough estuary.  These stations collect continuous information to 
address three primary topics:  1) short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine 
water parameters within different regions of the estuary (i.e., localized impacts of seasonal 
storm events, variability in water quality parameters in association with re-establishment of 
tidal circulation, interannual differences in rainfall, magnitude and influence of El Niño – La 
Niña events, spatial extent of oceanic and tidal forcing, and long-term changes associated 
with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, etc.); 2) verification, calibration, and future refinement 
of an existing two-dimensional water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) developed to predict 
levels of coliform bacteria and dispersion of environmental toxins; and 3) collection of 
fundamental baseline data for future development of a three-dimensional tidal hydrodynamic 
model for the greater South Slough/Coos Bay estuaries.
      
A water chemistry component is also associated with the core monitoring program.  
Variables measured include: nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, 
total suspended solids, and silica.  Grab samples are collected for both high and low tides at 4 
sampling sites, and automated samplers collect diel samples to compare marine and riverine 
sites during wet and dry seasons.
      
The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State of 
Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the Oregon 
Department of Land Conservation and Development and the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality in July 1995.

On 01/09/03 at 0915, the station was powered down for maintenance.  A 40W solar panel 
was installed that coupled a deep cycle marine battery powers the NL100.  The original 10W 
solar panel powers the CR10X data collection.  A signal splitter sends real-time and WDMP 
data through the network link to the laboratory.

The following data were not recorded during the maintenance and the hourly and daily

13)	Other Remarks/notes
Precipitation data recorded at the North Bend Airport compared to CM weather station:

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
