2. Entry verification:

The data were directly downloaded from the YSI PC6600 data loggers into the YSI 
Ecowatch for Windows program in the PC. The data were graphed and visually 
checked for any obvious outliers. Notes are made of any unusual data or faulty 
probes. The data is then exported as a .csv file into an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and spaces. The CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls macro was used to QA/QC the data. The macro automatically formatted 
the column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications. It QA/QC's the data file for missing data points and filled all 
cells without data with periods. It also compiled a list of all data that fell 
outside the stated range of the different data logger probes. An explanation for 
the missing and the deleted data is included in this metadata sheet.  The files 
were then transferred along with the associated metadata by disk to the CDMO.  
The files are archived at OWC. Dr. David Klarer is responsible for both data 
logger deployment and data management.



3.Research Objectives:

Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two-week periods at 
two sites within the Old Woman Creek estuary- one in the upper reaches at State 
Route 2(SU) and the other near the mouth, just south of State Route 6 (WM). The 
purpose of this monitoring program is to document the role of this Great Lakes 
estuary in the Lake Erie ecosystem, particularly the estuary's role in 
mitigating storm flow that passes through it.  

4. Research methods:


The YSI monitoring program began on 1 March 2000 at both sites.  Prior to 
deployment of the data loggers, a 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was bolted to a metal 
sign post that had been driven into the sediment.  Each pipe had 4 rows of holes 
drilled into it spanning the area of the probe guard on the data logger so that 
the probes would have direct contact with the surrounding waters.  Due to very 
low Lake Erie water levels, it was necessary to move both the data logger sites 
prior to deployment in 2000. At site SU the data logger was moved less than .5 
meters into a deeper water area on 10 November 1999 and then the trap was 
subsequently lowered to a depth of 0.077 meters above the bottom. At site WM the 
data logger was moved less than 1 meter eastward and the trap was also lowered 
until it was 0.07 meters above the bottom. On 14 June 2000 between 07:30 and 
07:45, this trap was subsequently raised .15 meters to try and diminish bottom 
effects on the turbidity.  Dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity, depth 
and specific conductance readings are taken when the instrument is pulled at 
each site. The data loggers are replaced in the field after a one, two, or three 
week deployment, depending on temperature and degree of fouling of the data 
loggers.  The data is retrieved from each data logger and each data logger is 
recalibrated (according to the directions in the YSI Operations Manual) before 
being returned to the field.  Conductivity, pH (2 point calibration), and 
turbidity (2 point calibration) are calibrated using commercial standards.


5. Site location and character:

Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the southern 
shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio (Latitude 41 22' N; 
longitude 82 31' W). 
The data logger at the State Route 6 (WM) site (Latitude 41 23' 15N, Longitude 
82 30' 50"W) is very close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In this portion of 
the Reserve, the creek is very shallow but extends over a large surface area.  
This site frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie waters. 
The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) site (Latitude 41 21' 45N, Longitude 
82 30' 25"W) is very near the southern boundary of the reserve.  This site is in 
the upper reaches of the estuary.  The data logger is sited near a concrete 
piling of the eastbound Ohio State Route 2 bridge.  At this site the creek is 
relatively deep and narrow.  Although water direction and flow is influenced at 
this site by changes in Lake Erie water levels, this site doesn't have direct 
contact with Lake Erie waters. 


6. Data collection periods:

Sampling at WM began on March 1, 2000 at 00:00:00.  Sampling for 2000 ceased at 
WM site on November 30, 2000 at 23:45:00.  Sampling at SU began on March 1, 2000 
at 00:00:00.  Sampling ceased at SU site on November 30, 2000 at 23:45:00.

All data missing 03/01/00 (16:45:52-18:45:52) and (20:15:52-22:00:52) due to 
natural changes in water level due to wind causing the data logger to be 
partially or completely out of the water.
All data missing 03/09/00 (18:45:52-21:00:52) due to natural changes in water 
level due to wind causing the data logger to be partially or completely out of 
the water.
High specific conductivity and salinity from 03/13/00 (20:45:52) through 
03/14/00 (21:15:52) is most likely due to an influx of road salt from the State 
Route 6 Bridge that is due north of the site. Data was not deleted.  


All data missing 03/29/00 (08:45:52) due to natural changes in water level due 
to wind causing the data logger to be partially or completely out of the water.

datalogger.

DO(%) and DO(mg/L) were deleted 03/26/00 (17:00:52) through 03/29/00 (08:30:52) 
due to low abnormal oxygen activity in the estuary - cause unknown.

All turbidity readings from 05/09/00 (07:45:52) through 05/23/00 (07:15:52) were 
suspect since the probe could not be calibrated at the end of the deployment. 
This data was deleted.
All data are missing 05/25/00 (07:45:52-08:00:52) due to data logger being out 
of water - cause unknown. 
High turbidity readings throughout the entire month due to biological activity 
(carp) in the estuary. Data was not deleted. 


SU: Water levels were zero or negative due to shallow water, indicating that the 
depth probe was above water level. There is no indication from the other 
readings that any of the other probes were out of the water. The following water 
levels were zero or negative:

No missing data during this month.




12. Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure when no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of equipment, 
elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to calibration (both 
pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see Anomalous Data 
Section (11).  To find out more details about missing data, contact the Research 
Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

13. Post deployment information

End of Deployment Post-calibration Readings in Standard Solutions: (Standard 
value is in parenthesis) Dissolved oxygen standard is 100%, unless noted. Depth 
is always 0.0 meters.
