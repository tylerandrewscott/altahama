2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The 
CDMO Data Logger Program (PADBA_01.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls 
the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the 
data collection schedule).  The data is downloaded once a month in the field to a Toshiba 
laptop computer connected to the storage module using PC208W software or a Palm 
m515 using PConnect software, both are Campbell Scientific software. 

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program 
was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 
2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  
There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited 
monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces error 
and summary reports. All anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in the 
"Data anomalies/ Data corrections" section, along with any corrections that were 
preformed.  The raw data and Access tables are stored on the laptop, on the desktop 
SWMP computer in the lab and archived on compact discs. 

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports are "Air temp difference (over a 15 
minute time period) is greater than 3.0 degrees C" and "Rel hum difference (over a 15 
minute time period) is greater than 25%". All errors were double checked with other data 
that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted in Section 11.  Robin Cottrell
performed all data management.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record meteorological data at Padilla Bay for use in studies 
investigating correlations between meteorological data and water quality data, biological 
data, or other phenomenon in Padilla Bay and its watershed.


4) Research methods:

Data is downloaded once a month from the weather station because the storage module can 
only hold 49 days of data before the datalogger begins to overwrite data and the Weather 
Data Management Program cannot organize and sort raw data files that span more than two 
months. The sensors are visually inspected at this time for debris or damage except for the 
PAR sensor that cannot be seen from the ground so is inspected less often. Due to the 
location of the weather station in the middle of flat farm fields the sensors require very little 
cleaning. The most common problem occurs seasonally from air borne seeds partially 
blocking the rain gauge funnel. To mitigate this problem weeds near the site are cut before 
they set seed. 

Sensors are sent in to Campbell Scientific to be calibrated according to their maintenance 
schedule recommendations. On occasion very high or very low barometric pressures were 
checked against weather data collected in Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island.


5) Site location and character:

Padilla Bay (48º 30' N; 122º 30' W) is a shallow embayment in northern Puget Sound 
located in the greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary. It is an "orphaned" estuary in that 
the Skagit River, which formed the delta mud flats of Padilla Bay, no longer enters the bay 
directly. The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera marina, which covers 
approximately 3,000 ha. Zostera japonica, a recent invader to the region, now covers about 
350 ha of the bay. Tides are mixed semi-diurnal with a mean range of 1.55m. Salinity varies 
from about 15 to 30 PSU. Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed is 
agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay. Some freshwater from 
the Skagit now enters Padilla Bay from the south through the Swinomish Channel which 
connects Padilla Bay to Skagit Bay. Other major freshwater flows into this area of the Puget 
Sound-Georgia Basin estuary from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north. 
Padilla Bay is bordered on the east and south by flat, diked farmland; farther to the east are 
foothills of the Cascade Range. March Point, on the western edge of the reserve, is the site of 
two large oil refineries. To the north and west are the San Juan Islands of northern Puget 
Sound. 

The weather station is located near the southeast corner (122° 28' 4.81" W; 48° 27' 50.58" N) 
of Padilla Bay on a 40 hectare demonstration farm that is owned by the Reserve. Flat fields 
that are farmed for seasonal crops surround the site. Access is off of Bayview-Edison road 
about 150 m down a gravel driveway.

The sensors are mounted on a 3 m tower that is secured to a concrete pad as specified by the 
manufacturer, Campbell Scientific. The relative humidity/temperature sensor is mounted 2 m 
high and the wind and PAR sensors are at the top of the tower 3 m above ground level. The 
tipping-bucket rain gauge is bolted to a slab of wood that is attached to the top of a 55 gallon 
metal drum filled with water for stability, the top of the rain gauge is 1.2 m above ground 
level. Surrounding the site is a six foot high chain link fence for security. The weather station 
is about 300 m from the diked edge of the bay and approximately 4 km SE of the Bayview 
Channel YSI deployment site and about 4 km south of the Padilla Bay Research Reserve 
laboratory. 


6) Data collection period:

13) Other Remarks/notes
Occasionally throughout the year wind direction values were recorded as small negative 
numbers (<-0.99). According to a Campbell Scientific technician newer programs correct this 
to zero so these values have been changed in the Access Database master table to zero.

In 2001 an incorrect multiplier was entered for the LiCor PAR sensor so all of the PAR data 
from January 1st through July 31st at 14:15, 2002 (when a new program was loaded) were 
corrected by multiplying all 15 minute data by a correction factor of .604 (the ratio of the 
correct/incorrect multiplier) then the data was recompiled using the Weather Data 
Management Program.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.
