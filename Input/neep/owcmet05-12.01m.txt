2.	Entry Verification

A.	Data Input Procedures:

The 15 minute data, 1 hour average data, and the 24 hour data are downloaded 
from each instrument at the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X 
datalogger (the CDMO Data Logger Program was loaded into the CR10X and 
controls the sensors and data collection schedule (See Part B of this section 
for the data collection schedule). The CR10X is then interfaced with the PC208W 
software supplied by Campbell Scientific. The data is collected in a storage 
module and retrieved monthly and then downloaded into a computer containing 
the PC208W software. The data is also saved as a monthly raw data file 
(month01.dat) onto a Jazz Disc Drive.

After an entire month of data are available, the files are converted to an 
Access database by the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP). This 
program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data 
collection schedule. The WDMP will automatically input and convert the 
monthly raw data files into an Access Database.  There are three main steps the 
WDMP performs. First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file 
into an Access Database. Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined 
set of error criteria (See Part C of this section). Finally, it produces error and 
summary reports.  Any anomalous data are investigated and are noted below in 
the Anomalous Data Section.  Any data corrections that are performed are noted 
in the Data Anomalies/Missing Data Section (Section 8).  Common errors noted 
in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria, 
temperature change of greater than 30 C in a 15-minute period, and the 
precipitation of greater than 5 mm in 15 minutes. Each of these common errors 
was checked and either accepted as valid or listed as anomalous data.  Dave 
Klarercompiled and reviewed all 2001 data.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

3.	Research Objectives

The objective of this work is to record the data over a long time period for Old 
Woman Creek to look at long term trends and seasonal variability in weather 
conditions.  An added function is to provide the weather data necessary for researchers to 
examine the impact of changing weather conditions on the ecology of the estuary.

4.	Research Methods (Campbell Weather Station)
   
The Wind Sentry, temperature and relative humidity sensor, 
barometric sensor and the LiCor PAR sensor are located on a 10-meter tower following the 
descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual V 4.0.  The tipping rain gauge is 
located about 5 meters southeast of the tower. The sensors are wired to the CR10X following 
the protocol in the CDMO Manual.  

The Campbell weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce 
both hourly and daily averages of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric 
pressure, rainfall, wind speed and direction, and PAR.  An instantaneous sample is taken 
every 15 minutes and is stored in array 150 and 151.  The data is stored onsite in a SM4M 
storage module.  The modules are swapped at monthly intervals and the data is then 
downloaded into a computer for processing.( see data input section 2). Periodically, 
sensors on the weather station are inspected for damage and cleaned, if necessary.  Sensors are 
sent to Campbell Scientific for recalibration at least every two years.


5.	Site Location and Character

The Old Woman Creek State Nature Preserve and National Estuarine Research 
Reserve is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie east of the City of Huron, Ohio. The 
reserve lies within the Lake Erie Biogeographic Region.  Old Woman Creek drains 
a primarily agricultural watershed with corn, soybeans, and winter wheat being 
the most important crops. The weather station is located within the boundaries of the 
reserve, due east of the parking lot at the Ohio Center for Coastal Research.  The 
coordinates of the station are 41 deg 22'40" N and 82 deg 30' 29"W.

6.	Data Collection Period

Weather data was collected from 1 May though the end December, 2001.

7.	Distribution

According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy

NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize, and publish summaries of the 
NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program data.  The OWC Research Coordinator (RC) 
retains the right to be fully credited for having collected and processed the data.  
Following academic courtesy standard, the RC and the NERR site where the data were 
collected will be contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any 
part of the data are used. 

The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only as good as the 
quality assurance and quality control procedures outlined in the enclosed metadata 
reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for its subsequent use/misuse in 
any further analyses or comparisons. The Federal government and the State of Ohio do 
not assume liability to the Recipient or third persons, nor will the Federal

8.	Associated Research and Monitoring Project

The two SWMP data loggers are located within 1 and ½ kilometers of this weather 
station. The two sites were established to determine the role of the estuary in 
mitigating storm flow though the system and the impact of Lake Erie on the estuary.

13.	Other remarks

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.
