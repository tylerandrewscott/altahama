2. Entry verification

The data are uploaded from the YSI 6000 datalogger, to a PC with the YSI PC6000 
data transfer software. Each file is uploaded in three formats, in the YSI 
(.dat) format, in comma delimited (labeled .csv) format, and in space delimited 
(labeled .txt) format. Three copies of each file in all three formats are then 
archived. The PC6000 software is used to plot the data which are then subject to 
preliminary review to detect questionable data, outliers, or probe malfunction. 
The dataloggers are tested for performance regarding field deployment, fouling 
and calibration. Copies of the plots from each deployment as well as the tests 
are filed with the respective field log. 

Each comma delimited file is imported into Excel 5.0 where it is processed 
according to the NERRS CDMO operations manual. Files are merged to contain data 
on a monthly basis. Missing date and time stamps, along with the known or 
probable cause are documented in the missing data section of the metadata. If 
for any reason the time stamps of a file are incorrect, they are corrected and 
documented in anomalous data. Using an Excel macro data collected at fifteen 
minute intervals are sieved to contain data collected at 30-minute intervals. 
When possible, the Import.xls macro is run to fill in missing date and time 
stamps. If for some reason the Import.xls macro will not run this part of the 
editing procedure is performed manually. The pre and post-deployment data 
records or "data-tails" are removed and then the Import.xls macro is again used 
to put periods in all cells missing data. At this point the files are saved in 
comma delimited format with the .csv extension. These files are considered to be 
the WQBNERR raw data files and are sent to the CDMO for archival.

The CDMO Excel macros are then run to check that every day of each month has the 
appropriate number of date and time stamps, and to highlight data outliers. All 
data outliers are documented in the anomalous data section and are removed from 
the data set at the discretion of the research coordinator. At this point the 
files are saved in the Excel workbook format with the .xls extension. A graphing 
program is used to graph each file and run statistical analyses to determine if 
any other anomalous data is present and needs removing. Any data that is deemed 
anomalous is documented in the anomalous data section. All removed data is also 
documented in the missing data section, and replaced with periods. When the 
editing process is complete the final CDMO Column Reformat macro is run and the 
file is saved in ASCII text format (with the .txt extension). These files are 
then sent electronically by FTP to CDMO. 

Data files are archived at the Reserve as follows. Three copies of the WQBNERR 
monthly raw data files are archived in comma delimited format (with the .csv 
extension). Three copies of each final monthly data file are archived in the 
Excel workbook format (with the xls extension), as well as in ASCII format (with 
the .txt extension). 

3. Research objectives:

It is well known that eutrophication is occurring in many temperate, shallow, 
coastal estuaries of North America, as well as around the world. Waquoit Bay is 
representative of shallow coastal embayments that occur from Cape Cod to Sandy 
Hook, New Jersey. It is within the Virginian biogeographic province, on the 
transitional border (Cape Cod) between the Virginian and the more northern 
Acadian biogeographic province. It functions as a natural laboratory from which 
base line data can be collected to document trends associated with coastal 
development near these fragile habitats.

The temperate, shallow, coastal estuaries of this region are surrounded by sandy 
soils. Studies have indicated that non-point sources are the major contributors 
of nitrogen to these receiving waters. Waquoit Bay receives nitrogen from 
several non-point sources, including private on-site septic systems (their 
leachate percolates into groundwater which then enters the bay), run off 
(domestic and agricultural fertilizers, roads, animals), and atmospheric 
sources. On-site septic systems have been identified as the major contributing 
non-point source in these highly developed coastal regions.

Dense housing developments cover two peninsulas that form the western shore of 
the Childs and Seapit rivers, major contributors of fresh water to the reserve 
complex. Although these developments are outside of the Reserve boundaries, 
nitrogen discharged from septic systems, and in fertilizers has significant 
effects on the functioning of the Waquoit Bay ecosystem. The impacts of this 
nitrogen loading has been a subject of extensive study by researchers associated 
with the Reserve since its designation (1988).

It is well known that eutrophication of these ecosystems has led to alterations 
of habitat, negatively affecting important commercial fin and shellfisheries. In 
Waquoit Bay, for example, bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) were historically 
an important shellfishery. It has been shown that scallop survival is related to 
the vertical structure of eel grass (Zostera marina), and in 1951, vast 
meadowsof eelgrass were documented throughout Waquoit Bay. At this time, eel 
grass has essentially disappeared from the bay. Thick mats of seaweeds (benthic 
macroalgae such as Cladophora sp. And Gracilaria sp.) now cover the bottom of 
the bay where eelgrass meadows thrived two decades ago. As a result, the 
commercial harvest of bay scallops has collapsed. Unfortunately, the 
documentation of these changes is minimal, which makes evaluation of the rates 
of change resulting in these altered habitats difficult. A long term data base 
will make possible analyses of this type in the future.

Two sites are used to characterize conditions in Waquoit Bay. The "control" site 
is located in the central bay (CB). Data from this unit is considered to reflect 
the general conditions in the bay. This site is well flushed by the tides, is 
sufficiently exposed to winds from all directions, and is adequately removed 
from the navigation channel and mooring basins to be minimally affected by 
boating activities (relative to the rest of the bay). It is not a popular 
shellfishing spot. The "impacted" site is located in the north basin (NB) at the 
head of Waquoit Bay. This area is slightly deeper than the rest of the bay, and 
is sheltered from winds, particularly prevailing southwesterly winds during the 
summer months. It is presumably less mixed than the rest of the bay. It is 
located away from any channels, but is the site of more than 200 boat moorings, 
and is also a popular site for shellfishing. A second data logger has also been 
deployed at the North Basin site. However, this datalogger is suspended directly 
from a float, suspending the logger at a roughly constant water depth of 
approximately 0.9 m. Data files collected in this manner are labeled North Basin 
Surface (NS). When examined with reference to the NB data these files have the 
potential to document stratification of measured water quality parameters 
occurring in the North Basin.

Research and environmental monitoring at the Reserve is being conducted to 
expand our knowledge of the impacts of human activities in coastal areas. In 
addition to the contribution to the general body of knowledge, this work is 
intended to provide resource managers with information needed to formulate plans 
and regulations that will foster enhanced management and utilization of coastal 
resources. The scope of this research and monitoring includes efforts to 
understand ecosystem response to stresses, either natural or anthropogenic. It 
also includes the development of techniques to evaluate ecosystem changes, and 
methods and goals for habitat restoration.

During the last decade, there have been fish kills in the northern basin, as 
evidenced by sightings of dead and dying fish and shellfish along the shore. 
Preliminary data indicate that very low concentrations of dissolved oxygen occur 
near dawn (daybreak hypoxia). Low dissolved oxygen levels are a result of 
respiration by, among other biota, the seaweeds which have become exceedingly 
abundant throughout the bay.

Because the bay is so shallow, sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis usually 
reaches the bottom and dissolved oxygen concentrations increase quickly after 
sunrise. However, daybreak hypoxia is exacerbated during foggy, calm mornings. 
If fog sufficiently reduces insolation, oxygen production by photosynthesis may 
be insufficient to raise dissolved oxygen concentration levels. If such 
conditions persist, a fish kill is likely to occur. Several species of fish and 
shellfish have been found to be impacted by fish kills in the bay, including the 
commercially-important juvenile winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), and 
the hard shell clam, or quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria). Data from the north 
basin site and the WBNERR meteorological station will document the frequency, 
and dynamics of these events. Reserve staff will also collect dissolved oxygen 
concentration profiles with other instruments in order to define the areal 
extent of the North Basin habitat that experiences unusually low levels of 
dissolved oxygen.

In Waquoit Bay, the primary producer community has been dominated by macroalgae 
since the 1970's, unlike other more typical temperate shallow coastal 
embayments, which are dominated by phytoplankton. Seaweed-dominated systems are 
thought to rely on the energy subsidy provided by eutrophication. It is thought 
that the shift in trophic energy flow through this ecosystem (caused by nutrient 
loading) may have altered the delicate system equilibrium, allowing macroalgae 
to proliferate.

It is possible that the system may eventually revert to a phytoplankton-
dominated system. Increased phytoplankton productivity results in increased 
turbidity. Consequently, long-term measurements of turbidity will provide 
baseline measurements of this important parameter that is not only affected by 
biological phenomena, but also by weather, land use, hydrography, and boating. 
The addition of the WBNERR meteorological station (anticipated in Spring 1998), 
and ongoing studies concerning sediment resuspension due to boating, will aid in 
the analysis. This information will facilitate evaluation of changes as they 
occur. In the future, these records may be useful for evaluating the efficacy of 
remediation efforts intended to reduce nitrogen loading to the bay.

4. Research Methods

The 1997 YSI monitoring program season began on May 12, 1997, with the 
deployment of the only operational sonde available at the Reserve. This sonde 
was deployed at the control site and briefly collected data without any 
recognizable problems. The Reserve currently owns four YSI 6000 dataloggers. The 
pH and CTD/DO probes have recently been replaced for all four dataloggers; two 
dataloggers have been serviced, and one is being completely overhauled due to 
damage resulting from deployment during a hurricane. New QA/QC methods have been 
instituted at the Reserve, including the creation of standard operating 
procedures. These procedures have resulted in consistent data collection, 
maintenance, calibration, and testing procedures. They should allow the 
continuation of consistent data collection and treatment, leading to a quality 
long-term data base documenting the conditions of Waquoit Bay.

Each datalogger records measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, 
dissolved oxygen, depth, pH, and turbidity at fifteen minute intervals during 
deployment periods of approximately two weeks. During the winter months, the 
deployment period is limited to two weeks by battery life; during summer months 
the period is limited by biofouling. The sampling period is therefore held 
constant for the entire sampling season. The sampling season generally runs from 
March to December. It is, however, dependent on weather, the amount of ice on 
the bay, and the operational availability of the boat that serves as tender for 
the loggers. Unfortunately, because the data logger tender is small, the 
specifications of this system can exceed the limits of safety for data logger 
deployment/retrieval operations on windy days. As such, data logger deployment 
and retrieval are limited to fair weather. This contingency may result in 
interruptions in data collection that exceed those required for routine 
maintenance and calibration. Every effort is made to keep down time to a 
minimum. Routine maintenance usually results in a twenty-four to forty-eight 
hour lapse in data.

Each data logger is anchored with a 75 pound mooring to which two lines are 
attached. One line is attached to a surface float that marks the location. The 
other line is also attached to a float but the line is shorter so that the float 
remains submerged throughout tidal changes. The data logger is attached to the 
shorter line in a vertical manner so that the sensors (pointing downward) are 
suspended 0.75 m from the bottom. This system was chosen to minimize  
opportunities for vandalism, which has been a problem in the past.

After each deployment, dataloggers are brought back to the laboratory for 
downloading, instrument and sensor cleaning, calibration and testing as per the 
Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 6000UPG Manual.

5. Site location and character

The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (WBNERR) is located in the 
northeastern United States on the southern shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. 
About 8,000 people maintain permanent residency in Waquoit Bay's drainage area, 
which covers parts of the towns of Falmouth, Mashpee, and Sandwich. During 
summer months, the population swells 2-3 fold. Like many embayments located on 
glacial outwash plains, Waquoit Bay is shallow, fronted by prominent barrier 
beaches of South Cape (State Park) Beach and Washburn Island beach, and backed 
by salt marshes and upland forests. Two narrow, navigable inlets, reinforced 
with granite jetties, have been constructed through the two barrier beaches to 
connect Waquoit Bay with Nantucket Sound to the south. A third shallow and 
generally unnavigable inlet opened through the Washburn Island barrier beach 
during Hurricane Bob in August 1991. It has not been reinforced and its fate 
remains uncertain. 

The western shore of uninhabited Washburn Island, with its low, steep bluffs and 
forested uplands, forms the western boundary of the reserve. However, tidal 
waters enter and leave the bay proper (and the Reserve) via the so-called Seapit 
and Eel rivers, which funnel tidal flows along the western shore of Washburn 
Island, through Eel Pond and ultimately to Nantucket Sound. 

At the northern end of the Bay, an area comprising a separate subwatershed, 
coastal bluffs of glacial till rise 30 feet above sea level, the highest land 
within the Reserve. Adjacent to the bluffs, the northern basin of the bay is its 
deepest area (2 m). Much of the remainder of the bay is only slightly shallower 
(e.g., 1.6 m). Bourne, Bog, and Caleb ponds are freshwater kettle hole ponds on 
the northern-most shore of the bay. As components of the same sub-watershed, 
they have a common albeit minor freshwater outflow into the bay's northern basin 
via a narrow channel through a brackish marsh. Although small, centuries of this 
flow has created a significant delta of sand that overlies much finer sediments 
found at comparable distances offshore. The source of this sand is the sandy 
beach over which this fresh water discharge must travel.

To the east and south, land in other subwatersheds surrounds several salt and 
freshwater ponds, including Hamblin and Jehu Ponds, brackish ponds that are 
connected to the Bay by the tidal waters of Little and Great rivers, 
respectively. The shorelines of these ponds are developed with residences which 
are occupied by both permanent and seasonal residents. Hamblin Pond and Little 
River are components of one subwatershed, and Jehu Pond and Great River are 
elements of a separate subwatershed. Further south lies Sage Lot Pond. It is in 
the least developed subwatershed which also contains the barrier beach and salt 
marsh system of South Cape Beach State Park (also a component of the Reserve). 
To the east, in the same subwatershed, lies the highly brackish Flat Pond. It 
receives minimal tidal flows of salt water from Sage Lot Pond through a narrow, 
excavated channel. The remainder of the input to Flat Pond is largely 
groundwater, and run off, both of which are likely affected by an adjacent golf 
course and an up-scale residential development.

The tidal range of Waquoit Bay is approximately 0.5 meters. The salinity in most 
of the by ranges from 26 to 31 psu. The largest source of freshwater to Waquoit 
Bay is the Quashnet/Moonakis River. "Quashnet" applies to that portion of the 
river within the town of Mashpee, and "Moonakis" refers to the brackish estuary 
at the river's mouth, lying in the town of Falmouth. Quashnet will be used 
hereafter to refer to the entire river. A component of an additional 
subwatershed, it originates in Johns Pond situated north of the bay and 
traverses Reserve lands, forests, cranberry bogs, residential areas, and the 
Quashnet Valley Golf Course before joining the Bay, south of the southern 
boundary of the bay's northern basin. Although it is the largest source of fresh 
water, the Quashnet River delivers significantly less nitrogen to Waquoit Bay 
than does the Childs River, which also originates in Johns Pond.

The Childs River is the second largest input of freshwater to the Bay. A 
component of an additional subwatershed, it runs through densely developed 
residential areas. The Childs River subwatershed receives the highest nitrogen 
loading (and is the largest nitrogen contributor to the Waquoit Bay system) of 
all the subwatersheds.. Another source of freshwater is the discharge of Red 
Brook through brackish marshlands into Hamblin Pond. Additional freshwater 
enters the bay elsewhere through groundwater seepage, precipitation and smaller 
stream flows. There is little surface water runoff entering directly into the 
bay due to the high percolation rates of Cape Cod's coarse, sandy soils.

The "control site", considered the baseline unit, is located in the central bay 
(CB) at latitude 41 deg. 34' 00" N, longitude 70 deg. 31' 47" W. The water depth 
at this site ranges between 1.2 m to 1.7 m. The benthic habitat is primarily 
characterized by a muck and organic ooze substrate, with prolific benthic 
macroalgae.

The Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) has been designated a Superfund 
Site with at least one or two toxic plumes traveling in the ground water, having 
direct impact on Johns and Ashumet Ponds in the upper part of the watershed. 
Crops of cranberries from commercial bogs located on the Quashnet River have 
been deemed unfit for consumption due to contamination from ethylene dibromide 
(EDB) a jet fuel additive. The Quashnet River and the upper Childs River (north 
of Route 28) components of the Reserve complex have both been found to have 
sufficient numbers of coliform bacteria to close them to shellfishing. Two 
probable source of this contamination are failing septic systems, and storm 
water runoff. Pesticide and herbicide applications on cranberry bogs, golf 
courses and lawns also impact this ecosystem. 

The CB site is southwest of the mouth of the Quashnet River, a small stream fed 
primarily by groundwater. The stream's freshwater discharge into Waquoit Bay is 
typically 5-10 cubic feet per second. The resultant discharge plume at these 
levels has an undetectable influence on salinity at the CB site. However, 
occasional releases of impounded water at an upstream cranberry bog 
significantly increases discharges to upwards of 30 cubic feet per second. The 
stream's discharge plume from these events results in slight reductions in 
salinity at the CB site. These discharges occur in the fall (harvesttime) and in 
the coldest periods of winter. They should be of minimal and traceable influence 
on the data set obtained by the CB data logger.

The north basin (NB) site latitude 41 deg. 34' 44" N, longitude 70 deg. 31' 58" 
W is characterized by water depths of 1.6 - 2.4m. The benthic habitat is similar 
to the CB site, characterized by muck or organic ooze substrate and benthic 
macroalgae. This site is subject to the portion of contaminant loading noted 
above that is mixed and cycled in to this basin. This site is sampled at two 
depths, NB and NS (North Basin Surface) to document the stratification of 
dissolved oxygen content especially in respect to daybreak hypoxia.

6. Data collection period

Central basin data collection began on May 12, 1997. Northern basin data 
collection commenced on June 2, 1997. North Basin Surface data collection 
commenced on July 2, 1997. All monitoring is considered long term.

7. Associated researchers and projects
1996-1997 Projects by Waquoit Bay Reserve Staff:
    Impacts of boating. The object of this research is to determine if 
motorboating sufficiently decreases the amount of light that reaches the bottom 
of the bay so as to result in chronic ecosystem stress. Reserve staff and 
volunteers measured the amount of sediment resuspended by the propeller wash of 
motorboats and coupled them with measurements of the reduction of light levels 
at various depths of water.
    Remote sensing with satellites and airborne video cameras as tools for 
coastal management. Dr. Crawford worked with Thomas Stone of the Woods Hole 
Research Center to develop a technique for rapid assessment of nitrogen loading 
conditions in coastal waters. This approach linked analyses of remotely-sensed 
data with field measurements of chlorophyll concentration in various coastal 
areas of Cape Cod. Several volunteer water quality monitors assisted with this 
data collection. 
    Horizontal gradients of hydrologic variables and the effects of motor boats. 
Dr. Crawford and the research assistant, used a data logger fitted to a towed 
body to describe several microenvironments in the bay which were altered by the 
quantity of boat traffic.
    Fish biology component of the 1997 Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean 
Study. Dr. Crawford conducted studies of Arctic fish ecology as part of this 
study, for climate modeling purposes, of air/sea/ice albedo feedback mechanisms.
    WBNERR BayWatcher volunteer group water quality monitoring program. Citizen 
volunteers conduct long-term monitoring of water quality at six sites within the 
Reserve. Measurements are taken year round when possible, monthly during the 
fall, winter and spring, and bi-monthly during the summer. Parameters monitored 
are air and water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, Secchi depth, total 
depth, and chlorophyll a. 
    Endangered Species Monitoring Project. Over 20 volunteers and the seasonal 
Endangered Species Coordinator monitor the Piping Plover and Least Tern 
populations on South Cape beach and Washburn Island. Symbolic fencing is erected 
around the nesting areas to prevent foot traffic. Predator exclusion fencing is 
erected around the Plover nests. This year several Plover chicks successfully 
hatched and fledged.

nitrogen loading.
    Development and evaluation of an indicator of "Estuarine Biotic Integrity".

Data Columns are separated by tabs.

9.Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions

The Waquoit Bay file naming convention is as follows: WQBNERR raw data files are 
named as follows: The first two characters are for the day of the month, the 
third, fourth, and fifth are for the first three letters of the month, the sixth 
is for the last number of the year, and the seventh and eighth are for the site 
description (central bay (CB), north basin (NB), or north basin surface (NS)). 
These files are archived as described above.

After the WQBNERR raw data files are merged into monthly blocks they are named 
according to the CDMO Operations Manual. The first two characters are the site 
description, the second and third stand for the month, and the fourth and fifth 
for the year. The raw unedited monthly files are saved in comma delimited format 
(with the .csv extension), and are to be archived by the CDMO as the WQBNERR raw 
data. Outlier files created while running the macros are saved with the same 
file name but with the .out extension. Final edited files are saved in Excel 
workbook format (with the .xls extension) and also in ASCII format (with the 
.txt extension). The raw unedited monthly files, and the final ASCII formatted 
final files are sent by FTP to the CDMO.

10.  Data anomalies

After examination of calibration logs it was determined that the data from May 
through October was collected in local 
daylight time instead of local standard time or EST.  All date/times for these 
months were corrected to local standard time on 04/20/00.  All of the 
information on the 
data in this metadata file has been adjusted for that error. 

Central Bay

May 1997 - File name: CB0597

Logger was deployed: 05/12/97 @ 15:30 to 05/28/97 @ 13:30
				05/29/97 @ 14:30 to 05/31/97 @ 23:30.

a) QA/QC methods (the WBNERR SOP's) were still being developed, so for this 
deployment the procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and 
the YSI 6000UPG Manual.
b) All pH data for this file are suspect; some drifting during field deployment 
is probable. The probe was reading properly in buffer solutions, but the 
diagnostic readings never stabilized. They were exhibiting a "walking" behavior 
(characterized by continuous positive and negative fluctuations). The
probe was found to have a loose internal connection on June 25, 1997. No pH data 
were removed from the file.
c) The following records contain turbidity values that were determined to be 
anomalous (zero values) by the CDMO outliers macro. No data were removed.

e) Water level above sensors during the 05/12/97 - 05/28/97 deployment was 
roughly 1.8 - 1.9 m. During the 05/29-97 - 05/31/97 deployment it was roughly 
1.4 m. This suggests that the logger was incorrectly reset in a shallower 
location after servicing (i.e., the mooring was moved).

June 1997 - File name: CB0697

Logger was deployed: 06/01/97 @ 00:00 to 06/09/97 @ 14:30
               06/10/97 @ 14:00 to 06/24/97 @ 12:30
               06/26/97 @ 10:00 to 06/30/97 @ 22:30

a) QA/QC methods (the WBNERR SOP's) were still being developed, so for this 
deployment the procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and 
the YSI 6000UPG Manual.
b) The following records contain turbidity values that were determined to be 
anomalous (zero values) by the CDMO outliers macro. No data were removed.

July 1997 - File name: CB0797

Logger was deployed: 07/01/97 @ 00:00 to 07/06/97 @ 04:30*
               07/11/97 @ 15:30 to 07/21/97 @ 09:00
               07/23/97 @ 15:30 to 07/31/97 @ 21:00**
* Logger battery compartment flooded after 07/06/97 @ 04:30 and no data were 
recorded until redeployment on 07/11/97 @ 15:30.
** Logger battery compartment began flooding sometime before 07/26/97 @ 08:30 
when the record for that time period was not recorded. Logger continued to work 
through 07/31/97 @ 21:00. It ceased to record after that.

a) QA/QC methods (the WBNERR SOP's) were still being developed, so for this 
deployment the procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and 
the YSI 6000UPG Manual.
b) All parameters are suspect, battery compartment leakage may have caused 
voltage surges. 
c) During 07/01/97 to 07/06/97, the DO data are suspect. This probe failed post-
deployment lab tests and was retired. A new probe was installed for the 07/11 
deployment.
d) A new pH probe was also installed on this sonde for the 07/11 deployment.
e) The following records contain turbidity values that were determined to be 
anomalous (large negative values) by the CDMO outliers macro. No data were 
removed.

08/07/97 @ 15:30 to 08/20/97 @ 15:00
08/22/97 @ 16:00 to 08/31/97 @ 22:30

* Logger was flooded during this time and no data were recorded.

a) QA/QC methods (the WBNERR SOP's) were still being developed, so for this 
deployment the procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and 
the YSI 6000UPG Manual.
b) DO data were spurious between 08/08/97 @ 15:30 through 08/11/97 @ 16:30. Bad 
output was apparently due to the presence of a bubble under the membrane. These 
data were deleted. 
c) The salinity recorded during the 07/21/97 post-deployment check was 0.2 ppt 
lower than the actual. Suspect fouling caused a slight downward drift in 
readings.
d) The salinity recorded during the 07/31/97 post-deployment check was 0.3 ppt 
lower than the actual. Suspect fouling caused a slight downward drift in 
readings.
e) The following records contain turbidity values that were determined to be 
anomalous (large negative values) by the CDMO outliers macro. No data were 
removed.

               09/25/97 15:45 to 09/30/97 @ 23:45

a) QA/QC methods were still being developed, so for this deployment the 
procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 6000UPG 
Manual.
b) Logger was set to record at 15 minute intervals.

October 1997 - File name: CB1097

Logger was deployed: 10/01/97 @ 00:00 to 10/09/97 @ 11:45
               10/17/97 @ 15:45 to 10/31/97 @ 23:45

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) Sometime soon after 10/17/97 21:00 the turbidity probe wiper mechanism failed 
and the wiper "parked" on the sensor. Subsequent data for the remainder of the 
deployment were incorrect. Data from 10/17/97 @ 21:15:00 to 10/31/97 @ 23:45:00 
were deleted.

November 1997 - File name: CB1197

Logger was deployed: 11/01/97 @ 00:00 to 11/04/97 @ 18:45*
               11/06/97 @ 16:30 to 11/17/97 @ 11:45
               11/18/97 @ 16:00 to 11/24/97 @ 09:00**
* During this period the turbidity probe wiper was parked on the sensor and  
turbidity data were deleted. Battery depletion caused the logger to cease 
recording after 11/04/97 18:45. 
** Soon after 11/24/97 09:00 the logger shackle slipped from the mooring and the 
logger drifted to shore. All data subsequent to that time have been deleted. 

a) QA/QC methods were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) The dissolved oxygen data for the 11/06/96 to 11/17/97 deployment is suspect 
due to a high DO reading (107 %) during the post deployment performance 
evaluation (100 % was target).
c) The dissolved oxygen sensor began to fail during 11/19/97. Data collected 
during the remainder of that deployment (until 11/24/97 @ 09:00 when it left the 
mooring) is suspect but has not been deleted from the file.
 
December 1997 - File name: CB1297

Logger was deployed 12/05/97 @ 15:00 to 12/19/97 @ 10:45. 

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) Logger was adrift at the start of the month. It was recovered, recalibrated 
and then redeployed on 12/05/97.
c) Logger was removed from its mooring on 12/19/97 for the end of the season. It 
was not to be redeployed until the spring of 1998.

North Basin


June 1997 - File name: NB0697

Logger was deployed 06/26/97 @ 10:30 to 06/30/97 @ 23:30.

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) Water level data indicate the logger float--intended to always be submerged 
during the tidal cycle so the logger remains at a constant depth--was too far 
from the logger and was at the water's surface during low tides. Thus the 
logger's depth changed slightly (i.e., logger moved closer to the bottom)
during low tides. 

July File name: NB0797

Logger was deployed: 07/01/97 @ 00:00 to 07/10/97 @ 12:00
               07/23/97 @ 17:00 to 07/31/97 @ 23:30.

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.

August 1997 - File name NB0897

Logger was deployed: 08/01/97 @ 00:00 to 08/06/97 @ 10:30
               08/07/97 @ 16:00 to 08/12/97 @ 16:00
               08/22/97 @ 16:00 to 08/31/97 @ 23:30

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) The DO sensor began to fail during the morning of 08/04/97. Output improved 
during the 08/07/97 to 08/12/97 deployment but the probe was subsequently taken 
out of service because it failed post-calibration performance tests. Although 
the DO data are suspect, none were removed from the file. There were no DO data 
recorded during the Aug 22 - 31 deployment. 
c) The following records contain turbidity values that were determined to be 
anomalous (large negative values) by the CDMO outliers macro. No data were 
removed.

e) The salinity recorded during the Aug 22 - 31 post deployment check was 0.4 
ppt lower than the actual. Suspect fouling caused a slight downward drift in 
readings.
f) The logger float arrangement was corrected and the logger maintained proper 
depth (0.75 m above the bottom).

September 1997, File name: NB0997

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) No dissolved oxygen data are available for the September 01 - 03 and 05 -24 
deployments because there was no operational DO probe available.
c) The DO probe was reconditioned and used for the Sept 26 - 30 deployment. The 
sensor worked OK until 09/27/97 @ 09:00 when spurious output began, apparently 
from a bubble under the membrane. No data were deleted.
d) Low pH values during September 1997 indicate the occurrence of low DO events 
but little DO data were recorded. 
d) The following records contain turbidity values that were determined to be 
anomalous (small and large negative values) by the CDMO outliers macro. No data 
were removed.

October 1997, File name: NB1097

Logger was deployed: 10/01/97 @ 00:00 to 10/12/97 @ 03:15*
               10/17/97 @ 16:45 to 10/27/97 @ 19:30
* Battery depletion end this deployment
 
a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) File times were changed to account for daylight savings time.

November 1997, File name: NB1197

Logger was deployed 11/18/97 @ 15:30 to 11/30/97 @ 23:30.

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) The dissolved oxygen data for this file is suspect due to a high (106.5 %) DO 
reading during the post deployment performance evaluation (target was 100 %).
c) At 11/21/97 04:30 the turbidity sensor wiper failed. All subsequent turbidity 
data for this file are suspect.
d) The mooring was once again improperly set and the logger float was at the 
surface during low tides. The logger changed depth during these times (got 
slightly closer to the bottom).


December 1997, File name: NB1297

Logger was deployed: 12/01/97 @ 00:00 to 12/03/97 @ 13:00
               12/05/97 @ 15:30 to 12/19/97 @ 11:30

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) The dissolved oxygen data for Dec 05 - 19 are suspect due to a slightly high 
(103.7 %) DO reading during the post deployment performance evaluation (target 
was 100%).
c) All turbidity data for December 1997 are suspect. The wiper mechanism failed 
to operate for some unknown reason. 
d) The mooring was incorrectly set and the logger changed depth during low 
tides.


10. Data Anomalies Continued
North Basin Surface


July - File name: NS0797

Logger was deployed: 07/02/97 @ 10:30 to 07/10/97 @ 12:00
               07/23/97 @ 16:30 to 07/31/97 @ 23:30

a) QA/QC procedures were performed as per the Endeco/YSI NERR Brief, and the YSI 
6000UPG Manual.
b) The DO data collected July 02 - 10 are suspect because during the post 
deployment check the measurements were exhibiting some drifting. The probe 
calibrated without any error messages. The NERRS YSI service representative said 
as long as the proper procedures are followed during calibration the unit should 
collect decent data.
c) No DO data were collected during the July 23 -31 deployment because the probe 
was switched to another logger to replace a failed probe. No spare DO probe was 
available.
d) The logger was moored from a surface float so it would remain at a constant 
depth from the surface. Actual depth varied between roughly 0.6 m to 0.9 m. This 
was probably due to twisting and snagging of mooring lines drifting in the 
currents. This variation in depth persisted throughout the remainder of the data 
collected at this site in 1997. 
e) Noisy turbidity data may have been because of the detection of bubbles at the 
top of the water column.
