2) Entry Verification:

The data are uploaded using the computer program EcoWatch that accompanies the 
YSI 6000 series dataloggers.  After the file is uploaded from the water quality 
instrument, EcoWatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.dev.).  This information is printed out 
and attached to the Field Log for the particular deployment. This printout is 
used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the 
water quality instrument was removed from the water or those caused by 
instrument failure. The data are exported as a .csv file and then opened into a 
Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative recordings. 
When a complete month of data has been recorded the file is then reviewed.  The 
first step is to format the data so that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order and the data have the correct number of decimal place holders. The 
CDMO 5.0 Excel macro is used to check for any dates and times that data were not 
recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates and 
times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where 
data would normally be.  An explanation for the missing data is recorded onto 
the Water Quality Editing Log.  Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro 
to find readings outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range 
for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are removed from the 
file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing 
dates and times are recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside 
the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site were investigated for 
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, 
and instrument diagnostics. If the data are rejected from the file a period is 
inserted into the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and times are 
recorded onto metadata form. The metadata form is then submitted with the data 
files to the CDMO.  Paula May, Research Associate, was responsible for data 
management during 2003.  Upon data review by the CDMO, all periods were removed 
for dissemination purposes and left blank. 

3) Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island and Zeke's 
Island components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve and 
are anchored to the bottom of the selected sites.  Measurements are taken at 30-
minute intervals for approximately two to four week periods. These sites are 
relatively unimpacted by manmade perturbations and are considered long term 
monitoring locations.  The goal is to establish long-term water quality 
monitoring at relatively unimpacted sites by collecting data for each day of the 
year. 

4) Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March 1992 at the 
Research Creek site of the Masonboro Island component.  A second Masonboro 
Island site (Loosin Creek) was added on 26 February 2002.  Data collection 
started on 19 May 1994 at the Zeke's Island component (East Cribbings) and an 
additional site (Zeke's Basin) was added 1 March 2002.  The procedures described 
below were instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover data recorded 
previously. 

Before each YSI 6600/6600EDS is deployed, calibration and maintenance is 
performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, 
sections 3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are required for pH, turbidity and 
salinity; all other parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer 
solutions for a two-point pH calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased pre-made 
from a scientific supply house. The conductivity standard is obtained from YSI.  
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to 
settle at least 24 hrs prior to deployment. 

Data sondes are wrapped in a wet, white towel and placed in a bucket for 
transport to the site.  Monitoring stations are accessed using a small skiff 
equipped with an outboard motor.  During deployment the weather conditions and 
tide stage are recorded in the field observation log. The water quality 
instrument is placed inside a locked steel cage, then anchored approximately
15cm off the bottom, and chained to a post at the monitoring site. Every 30 
minutes during the sampling period measurements are taken for temperature, 
specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen 
concentration, depth, pH, and turbidity, and occasionally chlorophyll.  All data 
are recorded in Eastern Standard Time. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is brought back to 
the laboratory wrapped in a wet, white towel.  The weather and water quality 
measurements are again noted in the field observation log.  The calibration 
drift and the effect of biofouling on the water quality instrument are checked 
by comparing data readings in calibration standards. The water quality data are 
then uploaded, and the instrument is cleaned and calibrated as noted previously. 

5) Site Location and Character:

The components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve (from 
north to south) are: the Northern Sites component, Rachel Carson, Masonboro 
Island, Zeke's Island, and the Southern Sites component.  They are located along 
the southeastern coast of the United States in the Atlantic Ocean.  Currently, 
only data from Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island components are transferred to 
the CDMO. 

A. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The first Masonboro Island site (formerly called Masonboro Island (MS)) is 
0.72 km north east from the mouth of Whiskey Creek, and east of the 
Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a small navigable channel called Research 
Creek at 34°09'21.7" latitude and 77° 50'59.9" longitude. The site has a 
salinity range from 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 meters.  The 
creek bottom is characterized by sand and detritus based sediment with areas of 
soft mud with a depth ranging from 0.34 to 2.45 m.  The sole source of 
freshwater is rain.  Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, which is 
relatively unimpacted by manmade perturbations and it is not accessible to road 
traffic.  The site does experience minimal boat traffic.  

B. Loosin Creek, Masonboro Island
The second Masonboro Island site (added in 2002) is 1.2 km east of the ICW, and 
2.5 km south west of Masonboro Inlet, in a small navigable channel called Loosin 
Creek at 34° 10'20.0" latitude and 77° 49'58.1" longitude. The site has a 
salinity range from 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 meters.  The 
creek bottom is characterized by sand and detritus based sediment with areas of 
soft mud with a depth ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m.  The sole source of freshwater 
is rain.  Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, which is relatively 
unimpacted by manmade perturbations and it is not accessible to road traffic.  
The site does experience minimal boat traffic.    

C. East Cribbings, Zeke's Island
The first Zeke's Island site (formerly called Zeke's Island (ZI)) is located 
1.8 km south of Federal Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33° 
56'23.5" latitude and 77° 56'28.1" longitude. This site receives minimal 
freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear River through the 5.6 km rock 
jetty that separates the two bodies of water.  The site has a salinity range 
from 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but 
typically it can be found to range from 0.11 to 2.30 meters.  Bottom type 
substratum consists of large rocks (the cribbings) with sand and detritus based 
sediment.  There are no pollutants from land.  Marsh and dunes surround the 
site; not accessible to road traffic and minimal boat traffic.

D. Zeke's Basin, Zeke's Island
The second Zeke's Island site (added in 2002) is located 0.8 km south east of 
the Federal Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33° 57'17.0" latitude 
and 77° 56'6.0" longitude. This site receives minimal freshwater input from 
leakage of the Cape Fear River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separates the 
two bodies of water.  The site has a salinity range from 11-35 ppt and a tidal 
range that averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found to 
range from 0.1 to 2 meters. Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus 
based sediment with a layer of soft sulfuric mud.  There are no pollutants from 
land.  Marsh and dunes surround the site; not accessible to road traffic and 
minimal boat traffic.

6) Data Collection Period:

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992 while monitoring of 
Loosin Creek started on 26 February 2002.  East Cribbing data collection 
commenced on 19 May 1994 and Zeke's Basin data collection began on 1 March 2002.  
All monitoring is considered long term.

An asterisk (*) at the end of a deployment period indicates that a YSI 6600 
sonde was used for that particular deployment.  YSI 6600 EDS models were 
utilized for all other deployments. Each sonde is equipped with a non-vented 
depth probe and identical sensor models.

11) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section lists and explains all anomalous (suspect) data that has either 
been deleted or still remains in the data set.  The data are either extreme for 
the aquatic system being monitored or are outside the measurement range of the 
instrument. The cause of such anomalies may be a bad calibration, fouling of the 
sensors, boat traffic disturbances, malfunction of the instrument, or the 
measurements may be correct.


Research Creek, January

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish or crab gets caught in the probe guard cup.  In addition, 
large amounts of algae were observed on the sonde at the end of deployment and 
the wiper brush fell off the turbidity probe at some point during the 
deployment.

DO data for the following dates and times should be considered suspect due to 
compromised DO membrane integrity at some point during the deployment.
07/17/03 13:30 - 07/31/03 12:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered 
by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

DO data for the following dates and times should be considered suspect due to 
compromised DO membrane integrity at some point during the deployment.
08/14/03 11:30 - 09/11/03 09:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered 
by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.  The small 
negative turbidity values could be a result of the probe's resolution or 
contamination of the zero standard when the probe was calibrated.

Zeke's Basin, September

DO data for the following dates and times should be considered suspect due to 
compromised DO membrane integrity at some point during the deployment.
08/14/03 11:30 - 09/11/03 09:30

DO values drop unusually low during the following dates and times for unknown 
reasons.  Consider data suspect.
09/15/03 22:30 - 09/16/03 01:00

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered 
by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.  The small 
negative turbidity values could be a result of the probe's resolution or 
contamination of the zero standard when the probe was calibrated.

Zeke's Basin, November
For the following dates and times, data are suspect. Rain was documented on 
11/19/03 through 11/21/03, therefore suspect data may possibly be due to a 
weather event. Specific Conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and 
turbidity were all affected.

During the following date and times the turbidity data were outside of the 
sensor's range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid 
conditions that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe

12) Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. All periods were later 
removed for dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, and elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14) Other remarks:

Date/Time stamps were slightly off for many of this year's data sets due to a 
glitch in the YSI EDS software.  Time stamps were corrected to reflect half hour 
sampling increments.

Hurricane Isabel passed over the area on 18 September 2003.

High turbidity values above instrument's top range (1000 NTU), caused by 
blockage of light transmittance by an obstruction are left in the file.

Whenever specific conductivity or salinity data (referred to as conductivity 
data) were suspect, consider DO data in mg/l and depth suspect as well, since 
specific conductivity is used to calculate depth and DO data in mg/l.

Negative or zero depth readings were not deleted if the salinity and DO readings 
indicated that the sonde was submerged during these periods.	

There is a consistent problem with the position of the East Cribbings sonde. 
The sonde is located in a deep area between a sandbar and the shore.  At high 
tide, it is difficult to tell if the sonde was positioned correctly and as a 
result the sonde is sometimes positioned on the incline from the sandbar, which 
accounts for the various depths depicted in the data and the graphs.
