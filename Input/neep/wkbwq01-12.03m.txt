2. Entry verification

Data are uploaded to the PC from the Endeco/YSI 6600 multi-parameter data 
loggers and graphs are produced using EcoWatch software.  Graphs are evaluated 
for suspect data, as may result from probe failure or biofouling.  Notes are 
made of any unusual data, and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Files are 
then exported as .csv files using EcoWatch software.  The .csv files are 
imported into EXCEL, edited by removing headers and footers, and saved as EXCEL 
files.  Data at the beginning and end of each data record that were recorded 
when the instruments were out of the water are deleted. These data are 
identified by field notes that document the times in and out of the water, and 
by unusual depth data, usually negative or near zero. When deployment overlap 
occurs, the data produced by the newly calibrated sonde is accepted as being the 
most accurate. The appropriate files are merged to form complete monthly data 
sets and are saved as separate EXCEL files. Data that are missing because the 
instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are denoted by 
periods (.). These times are noted in section 11 of this document. 

Two types of post-calibration values are also used to determine operational 
viability of the sensors while deployed. One is obtained in the lab by placing 
un-cleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values given by the 
data loggers.  The second type is obtained in the field using a newly calibrated 
data logger (referred to as a control sonde). Data from this instrument are 
recorded in the field at the time of the last scheduled reading by the deployed 
data loggers.  Both post-calibration values are reported in section 13 of this 
document, and may be used to determine the quality of the data recorded by the 
instruments (particularly DO) after deployment in the field.  Any erroneous data 
that are identified as being caused by probe failures (as determined upon 
examination of the data plots, or by post-calibration values) are deleted and 
replaced with periods, and noted in section 11 of this document.  Sensor readings 
that greatly deviate from known values of standards after the one-week deployment 
are not necessarily believed to be a result of probe failure, however.  If severe 
biofouling is believed to be the reason for poor agreement between the sensors 
and the standard values at the end of a deployment, the data are deleted and noted 
in section 11 of this document.  Symptoms of probe failures are extreme noise in 
the record, unrealistically high or negative data, or noisy or negative readings 
in standard solutions.  Examples of many such failures are given in the CDMO Manual 
(Version 3.0). Finally, the CDMO macros (update version 11/96) are used. The CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls macros allow the user to automatically format column widths to the
correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor specifications. It also allows
the user to QA/QC each data logger generated file for missing data points, fill 
all cells that do not contain data with periods, and find all data points that 
fall outside the range of what the data logger is designed to measure (outliers). 
Scott Phipps and Eric Brunden were responsible for all data management. Periods 
were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. 

3. Research objectives

The data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 
minutes.  Presently, four datalogger sites are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve. 
Data were collected from sites Fish River and Weeks Bay for the entire year. Data 
collection for sites Middle Bay and Magnolia River began in May. (see section 5 
for site descriptions)

Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon Secour 
Bay.  Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show that 
bottom waters (which flow into Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic in 
summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also in question, as 
largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during 
periods of high flow in the river.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if 
poor water quality periodically observed in Weeks Bay is generated within the 
bay proper, or is being introduced from Fish River or Bon Secour Bay with 
changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these 
two sites may be used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.  

There is a great deal of value in having a baseline data set for any management 
site. Changes or trends in any monitored parameters are readily apparent. Weeks 
Bay is useful as a model for estuary function and this data is necessary for the 
profile of the model. 

4. Research methods

Data loggers are moored on private docks and channel marker pilings. At each 
location, a PVC tube is attached to the piling using ratchets equipped with zinc 
disks (to help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A chain, attached to the cap 
of the tube, is shackled to the bail of the data logger.  Chains and tubes were 
cut to a length that places the data logger probes just below the bottom of the 
tube and 0.5 m above the sediment when in place. A nylon rope tied to the bottom 
of the piling also runs through the tube and is attached to the bale of the data 
logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the data loggers in the event 
that the tube breaks away from the piling.

The data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation and concentration, pH, water 
level and turbidity every 30 minutes central standard time (CST).  When 
available, a newly calibrated data logger is also used to record the above 
parameters at the time of data logger swap out.  The instruments are usually 
serviced (instruments post-calibrated, data uploaded, instruments cleaned and 
re-calibrated) every 7 days; however, they are programmed to log for 30 days in 
the event they cannot be serviced on schedule.  Just before deployment, window 
screening (1mm mesh size) is wrapped once around the cage that protects the 
sensors, and secured with plastic electrical tape.  Window screening is also 
secured in the bottom of the cage with silicone sealant.  This is done to reduce 
error in the data that may be due to larger animals moving in and out of the 
cage during the deployment.  This does not, however, preclude smaller animals 
such as barnacle and polychaete larvae from entering the cage and settling on 
the sensors.

Before the data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated data logger (when 
available) is lowered to the depth of the deployed instrument, and readings are 
logged. When time and weather conditions allow, this is done at the same time 
that the deployed instruments are programmed to record.  Post-calibration values 
are obtained in the lab by placing un-cleaned probes in standard solutions and 
recording the values given by the data loggers.

Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as described in 
the YSI Operating Manual.  Calibration standards, required for pH are purchased 
from a scientific supply house. Turbidity and salinity standards are created in 
house per Standard Methods (16th Ed.). Dissolved oxygen is calibrated using a 
calibration cup filled with about 1/2cm tap water, which creates a 100% water-
saturated air environment for the sensors when the sonde is placed in the cup.  
The sensors are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 minutes in the cup before 
DO (%Saturation) is calibrated.  

Servicing the instruments may result in a period of about 3 to 4 hours of 
missing data every week at each site. When sufficient numbers of data loggers in 
good working order are available, newly calibrated sondes are swapped with 
sondes at the end of their deployments so that no data points are missed. In 
this case a control sonde, the new deployment sonde and the old deployment sonde 
all log at the same time at the same depth (ie. first log, last log and control) 
for QA/QC comparison.  

5. Site location and character

Weeks Bay (30 23' N, 87 50' W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, 
located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It 
is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) runs nearly 
north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows into the mouth, where 
water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near 
the center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side 
of Weeks Bay.  Average depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths 
are significantly greater. The first is in the mouth of the bay, where the 
average depth is 6 m; the second is about 100 m upstream of the mouth of the 
Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally diurnal, 
and have a mean range of 0.4 m.

The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 14300 hectares and contributes 
approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow with the Magnolia River 
supplying the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 cubic meters per second; 
although freshets up to 4 times larger occur throughout the year.  These 
characteristics result in a freshwater residence time of 13 days under average 
discharge conditions, with a range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay 
varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  During periods of high flow 
in the river, salinity in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, 
except in the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  
However, during periods of low flow in the river, wind velocity and tidal stage 
are strong factors influencing salinity structure.  Salinity greater than 25 ppt 
is infrequently observed in Weeks Bay and is usually restricted to the southern 
portion of the estuary near the mouth.

Site FR (Fish River; 30 24.97'N, 87 49.37'W) is located near the mouth of Fish 
River at a mean depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there are 
small patches of Vallisneria sp. growing near (but not directly under) the data 
logger.  Land use in the water shed is agricultural, forested and residential 
with the residential portion rapidly increasing.  Directly surrounding the site, 
land use is residential and forested.  Nutrient concentrations at this site are 
variable and may be quite high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations 
ranging from approximately 4-100 µM and <0.5 to 7.5 µM, respectively, over the 
previous 10 years (Alabama Department of Environmental Management, Geological 
Survey of Alabama).  Over the past year, salinity ranged from 0 to 25 ppt at 
this site.

Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 22.85' N, 87 49.92' W) is located near the southeast 
shore of Weeks Bay, about 0.5 kilometers from the mouth of the estuary.  Mean 
water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land use 
around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture occurring 
inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at site Fish 
River. Over the previous 10 years, nitrate and phosphate concentrations here 
ranged from approximately 0.1 to 50 µM and 0.04 to 0.45 µM, respectively.  
Salinity ranged from approximately 5 to 27 ppt over the past year. 

Site MB (Middle Bay; 30 23.52' N, 87 49.37' W) is located near the middle of the 
north/south axis of Weeks Bay. Mean water depth at this site is about 1.5m; 
sediment type is sandy-silt. The datalogger at this site is secured to a 
navigational channel marker. There is no indication of pollutants and no sub-
aquatic vegetation at this site. Salinity concentrations from data collected 
indicates a range from approximately 0 to 22 parts per thousand.

Site MR (Magnolia River; 30 23.31' N, 87 49.03' W) is located near the mouth of 
Magnolia River at a mean depth of about 1.1 m. Land use around  this site is 
bottomland forest and shrub, with a fringing marsh. Upriver land use is 
substantially residential. The Magnolia river watershed is predominantly 
agricultural including turf, cotton and peanut crops as well as cattle grazing. 
There is no indication of pollutants and the bottom sediment is silty to clayey 
with no sub-aquatic vegetation. Salinity concentrations from data collected 
indicates a range from approximately 0 to 20 parts per thousand. The datalogger 
at this site is secured to a navigational channel marker.
 
6. Data collection period

The data loggers were first deployed at sites FR and WB on 27 October 1995, and 
have been continuously in service since then. Data loggers were first deployed 
for sites MB and MR on 05 May 2003. Deployment dates and times for 2003 follow, 
starting with deployment 001 for sites MB and MR and deployment 232 for FR and 
WB. Deployment information is listed by date and time of first in-situ data 
point logged followed by the date and time of last in-situ data point logged.

11. Data anomalies

General Information:
We feel that caution should be used when evaluating these data (especially DO % 
sat. and concentration) because of problems associated with biofouling. 
Particularly during the summer months, biofouling can cause degradation of the 
DO calibration over the one-week deployments.  At times the DO deviation from 
calibration at the end of a deployment was greater than 80% (in a water-
saturated air environment). We have made note of any data left in the record 
that we consider suspect because of biofouling or other reasons, based on post-
calibration values reported by the sensors, control sonde readings, and visual 
inspection.  

Year 2003 precipitation was 1623.6mm which is near average. Monthly 
precipitation totals ranged from a low of 13.0mm in January to a high of 325.9mm 
in June. Monthly precipitation totals are noted within the subheadings under 
specific information. We have also provided the data that were taken in the 
field at the time of the final logging interval before retrieval of the deployed 
data loggers, as well as the post-calibration values in section 13 below.  We 
encourage anyone using these data to first compare with the discrete data logger 
readings and post-calibration values on the given dates before evaluating the 
data.  If the user desires, it is possible to use these data to correct the 
deployed YSI data using regression analysis.  If not, then the user should 
delete compromised data at their discretion.

Dissolved oxygen readings at all sites for the month of September 2003 appear 
depressed and/or erratic. Based upon post-calibration values, in-situ readings, 
site comparisons and fluctuations within deployment records, it is thought that 
the low to negative DO readings reflect actual anoxic/hypoxic events in which 
hydrogen sulfides were present. Many negative DO readings are left in the 
record.

Datasonde records for sites Fish River (FR) and Magnolia River (MR) often show 
rapid fluctuations in parameter values due to probes moving in and out of clinal 
formations (thermocline, halocline, etc).
 
Refer to appendix A for daily rainfall events.

End of deployment control sonde readings in situ:
These measurements were taken by lowering a control sonde in situ and recording 
readings at or near the same time that the deployed data logger was recording 
its last log of the deployment. These readings were taken when an extra sonde 
with probes in good working order was available.

14. Other Remarks/Notes

There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded small 
negative values (-0001 and -0002). Because turbidity has a range of accuracy of 
+/-2 NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted these values in any way.
