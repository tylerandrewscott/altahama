2) Entry verification

a) Data Input Procedures

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded 
from each instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X 
datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr30.csi) was loaded into the CR10X 
and controls the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then 
interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  
This software was located on a computer to which the data was uploaded (every 15 
minutes) via a short haul modem to a computer located at Tijuana Estuary 
Visitor's Center.  The data was saved as a raw data file (TJR.dat) on the 
hardrive.  Following download from the CR10x the data were automatically 
uploaded via FTP to a SQL server at San Diego State University and are available 
near real time via the internet.  The data are exported monthly from the SQL 
server into CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) to generate error logs 
(see section 2c for the CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data 
Criteria), summary reports and to create export files to be sent to the CDMO.  
The WDMP program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERR 
Meteorological Data Collection Schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  Any anomalous data were investigated 
and are noted below in the Anomalous Data Section.  Any data corrections that 
were performed are noted in the Data Correction Section below.   All error 
messages and anomalous data were compared to reference data obtained from a 
nearby (1/2 mile) weather station operated by the NAVY.  Michelle Cordrey was
responsible for QA/Qc of data.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected 
with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 
2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) 
with the new data format found in version 4.0 (3 array output).  The new format 
produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), 
every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the 
daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  
With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to 
code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained 
in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were 
removed and left blank. 

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives (Campbell Weather Station):

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for the 
Tijuana Estuary in order to observe any environmental changes or trends over 
time. Samples were taken every 5 seconds and 15 minutes over roughly one month 
collecting intervals.  


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both 
hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An 
instantaneous sample is taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 
150.   A one-week sampling interval was chosen so that the CR10X datalogger 
would not run out of room and overwrite data, especially if the short haul modem 
link failed and data could not be automatically sent from the datalogger to the 
computer.  If this were the case, the data would have to be downloaded at the 
storage module to a laptop or the storage module would be replaced and brought 
back to the lab for uploading following procedures in Part D. Section 4.5 of the 
CDMO Operations Manual.  Periodically, sensors on the weatherstation are 
inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned.   
Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at 
minimum of every two years.  There were no other analyses done on the 
meteorological data at present.  


5) Site location and character:

The Tijuana River NERR is located on the Southern Pacific Coast, next to the 
California border with Mexico at a latitude of  32 deg. 34 min. N and Longitude 
of 117 deg. 07 min. W.  The area surrounding the 2,531 acre reserve is heavily 
developed by residential housing as is the watershed which drains into the 
estuary.  Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico and is subject to 
periodic raw sewage outflows.  The North Eastern section of is bordered by a 
military helicopter training base.  Vegetation in the area is dominated by 
common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) and Pacific cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).

The following climate summary for Imperial Beach was generated by the National Weather 
Service for the Imperial Beach Naval Outlying Landing Field which is 1 mile southeast 
of the TRNERR met station:

Imperial Beach is characterized by a sub-tropical climate with very dry summers 
and rain occurring during the winter season.   The most significant precipitation 
amounts occur in November, December, January, February and March.  The dry season 
extends from May through October.  On rare occasions an extra-tropical storm may 
move into this area in late August or September from the south, bringing moderate 
east to southeast winds and heavy rainfall.

The station is subject to daily land and sea breezes.  The sea breeze commences 
2 to 4 hours after sunrise and is experienced as a westerly wind with an average speed 
of 10 knots.  Land breezes normally begin 2 to 4 hours after sunset and are generally 
lighter than sea breezes.  The approach of a cold front may increase the local winds 
from south or southwest and they may reach speeds of 30 to 40 knots.  After the 
frontal passage the winds diminish at the station as they shift to the north or 
northwest even though offshore they may continue to maintain speeds in excess of 
30 knots.  When "Santa Ana" winds occur, normally during the fall and winter months, 
there is a sharp increase in temperature as winds begin blowing from the Mojave Desert.  
The humidity may decrease to 15%% or less.  Winds generally are sustained at 18 to 24 
knots with gusts in excess of 30 knots from the east or southeast.

Thunderstorms at the station in the summer are infrequent and usually very weak.  
They occur with greatest frequency in the interior and are usually confined to the 
higher mountains and southeastern desert areas.  During the winter they are rare but 
sometimes accompany cold frontal passages.

A local phenomena called the Catalina Eddy has a critical effect on fog and stratus 
along the coast from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.  The stratus layer is carried 
farther north and inland than would normally be expected. 

Descriptions of the specific sampling station follows:

The weather station is located approximately 30m west of the TR NERR Visitor 
Centor at a Latitude of 32deg 34min 28.32sec N and a Longitude of 117deg 07min 
37.05sec W.  The station is 50m north of the water quality sampling station.  
The vegetation surrounding the weather station are mainly upland scrub species.
	
The anemometer, wind direction and Licor sensors are located at the top of 
a 3.5 meter aluminum tower.  The temperature and humidity sensors are located 
midway up and on the west side of the tower. The Tipping Bucket rain gauge sits 
on a separate 2 meter high pole located approx. a meter to the west of the main 
tower. It is above the ground to limit interference from the security fence 
surrounding the weather station.  The sensors were wired to the CR10X following 
the protocol in the CDMO Manual.  


6) Data collection period:
Weather data collection began at the Tidal Linkage station in 1999.  However, 
since too long a period between calibrations of sensors had elapsed, data prior 
to July 2001 has been determined not to sufficiently reliable.

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The Tijuana River NERR has a water quality station located at the Tidal Linkage.  
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for  the Tijuana Estuary in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality both spatially and  over time.  Additionally, NERR SWMP tier 1 
nutrient monitoring is being conducted at the Tidal Linkage station.

11) Data anomalies/Data corrections:

Wind Direction Sensor Comment: A faulty connection between the wind direction sensor 
cable and the sensor body prevented the sensor from reporting the full range of 
wind direction data (0-360 degrees) accurately.  The sensor was reporting a maximum
wind direction of approximately 45 degrees, therefore all wind direction data were 
removed.

13) Other remarks:

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected 
with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 
2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) 
with the new data format found in version 4.0 (3 array output).  The new format 
produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes (array 15), 
every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the 
daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  
With the new format, the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to 
code for missing data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained 
in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were 
removed and left blank.
