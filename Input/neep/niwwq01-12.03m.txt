2.  Entry verification
The .dat and .csv versions of the raw data files were uploaded to a PC from YSI 
6000 or 6600 dataloggers. Raw data were uploaded and plotted using EcoWatch 
software. CDMO macros were also used in EXCEL 5.0 to identify anomalous or 
problem data in the files.  The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro allows the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro 
will allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel 
file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data, which were 
later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis. 

Comma delimited files are opened in Microsoft EXCEL 5.0 and edited by removing 
unnecessary headers, footers or spaces and any data which corresponds to the 
instrument being out of the water for maintenance.  Next, data plots were 
produced and examined for any anomalies using the CDMO graphing Macro for each 
variable. Suspect data were evaluated as to being either good or bad based on 
criteria outlined in the CDMO manual version 4.0.  If the data were determined 
to be bad, they were deleted from the final edited .txt file and then documented 
in the metadata.  If it could not be determined whether or not suspect data were 
bad (as was often the case with turbidity) the data were left in the final 
edited .txt file and noted in the metadata as anomalous. The dissolved oxygen 
(DO) and Turbidity (Turb) probes were the most problematic.  In instances where 
data values increased or decreased in an exponential fashion and or 
intermittently went outside the accepted range for that instrument and never 
returned to normal, the data were considered suspect, noted in the metadata, and 
removed from the final edited data file.  Missing data due to equipment failure 
or maintenance were replaced with periods(.), which were also later removed for 
data dissemination purposes and left blank. The date/hour and column reformat 
macros were then run on the data files before being saved in their final edited 
form (.txt).  Edited (.txt) and raw (.csv) files were then FTP'd to both the Sun 
Sparc II and the CDMO server and archived. Tracy Buck edited and archived the 
2003 data for Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, Oyster Landing, and Clambank Creek. 

3.  Research Objectives
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for North Inlet/Winyah Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality over time.  Four sites were chosen; two to represent our pristine 
site and the other two to represent impacted sites.  The Oyster Landing site is 
located near the center of the Reserve and is considered pristine.  The Clambank 
site is located on a waterway that receives run-off from the undeveloped area of 
the reserve and is considered a pristine site.  Debidue Creek and Thousand Acre 
are both located in waterways that receive run-off from heavily developed areas.  
Measurements were taken every 30 minutes over roughly two week collecting 
periods at the Oyster Landing, Debidue Creek, Clambank and Thousand Acre sites. 

4.  Research methods (YSI 6000 dataloggers)
YSI dataloggers are currently mounted in a 4" diameter PVC pipe which is 
strapped to a treated 2" X 6" board; and then attached via stainless steel bands 
to a piling at the Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, Clambank, and Oyster Landing 
sites.  The PVC pipe that houses the data loggers has two large windows cut out 
near the bottom for the probes to have direct contact with the water column.  A 
stop bolt placed through the PVC pipe below the cut out windows keeps the 
datalogger exactly one foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  Every 30 minutes 
measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, water temperature, pH, turbidity, and water level are recorded.  The 
two-week sampling interval has been selected due to biofouling of the individual 
probes and expected battery life.  At the end of each sampling interval, the 
dataloggers were brought back to the laboratory to be downloaded, cleaned and 
recalibrated following procedures in YSI Service Manual and the Standard 
Operating Procedures V3.0 provided by NERR SWMP.  Before the instruments were 
cleaned and recalibrated a post calibration reading was taken from each 
instrument in fresh standard to see if any of the instruments exhibited drift 
(see II-13).  The pH probe was calibrated using a two point method with 7,10 
standards.  The turbidity probe calibration also used a two-point method using 0 
& 123 NTU standards.  Specific Conductivity was calibrated using a one-point 
method and a 10 ms/cm standard that was purchased through YSI, Inc.  The 
turbidity wiper and DO membrane were changed after each deployment.  After 
approximately 24 hours of down time for cleaning and overnight relaxing of the 
DO membrane, the YSI dataloggers were re-deployed.  Sondes are switched out the 
same day at each site to avoid excessive periods of data loss.

5.  Site location and character
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in two tidal estuaries, North 
Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, 
located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type 
estuary (Pritchard, 1955).  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous 
winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal 
anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine 
forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The 
Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955), 
which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the 
largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km 
south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which 
are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain 
approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  Descriptions of the three 
sampling stations are as follows:

A) Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:17:57; long. 79:15:36) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek and is on the NW 
corner of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh (this site was relocated 07-19-
99 to the current location due to heavy siltation and degrading data quality).  
The present site is about 15m from the mouth of the creek.  At the sampling 
site, creek depth is approximately 2 m MHW and creek width is approximately 10 
m.  The creek empties into the northeastern side of the mid portion of Winyah 
Bay and directly drains pine forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 
0 to 15 ppt. and tidal range is approximately 1m.  The bottom is mostly composed 
of fine sediments and detritus.  Georgetown, 5 km upstream from the Thousand 
Acre site and on the southern side of Winyah Bay, is the homeport for a number 
of heavy industries including a steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a 
coal fired power plant.  A public sewage treatment plant, which discharges into 
the bay, is also located in Georgetown.

B) Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat.  33:20:58; long.  79:11:34). The Oyster Landing 
monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area located at 
the end of the Oyster Landing pier which is also where the NI-WB Bay NERR 
weather station site is located.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of 
Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of North Inlet.  The sampling site is 
located approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of Crabhaul Creek.  The creek 
directly drains pine-forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0-
32 ppt. and average tidal range is approximately 1.44m.  The creek has an average 
depth of ~2 m MHW and average width of ~150m MHW.  The bottom mostly is 
comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus.

C) Debidue Creek (DC) - (lat 33:21:37, long 79:10:05). The Debidue Creek 
monitoring site is considered an impacted site that is located approximately 1 
km south of the Debidue Colony.  The Colony is a large development built on man-
made canals that directly drain into the northern portion of Debidue Creek.  The 
DC site is also located in an ocean-dominated Spartina marsh that was formerly 
surrounded by pine-dominated uplands.  Salinity can range from 0 to full 
strength seawater and an average tidal range of approximately 2 meters.  The 
approximate depth and width at MHW at the site is 2.2 and 70 m respectively.  
The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and 
detritus.

D) Clambank Creek (CB) - (lat 33:20:02, long 79:11:34).  The Clambank Creek 
monitoring site is located roughly in the center of the reserve property.  This 
site is surrounded by a Spartina marsh and drains associated uplands.  Salinity 
ranged from 0.4 to full strength seawater (from August through December 2001) 
and an average tidal range of approximately 1.4 meters. At the sampling site, 
the depth and width at MHW are 2.4m and 40m respectively.  The average depth of 
the creek is 2.0m at MHW. The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash 
and some fine sediment.  This site is considered a pristine site and is 
influenced by its close proximity to North Inlet.  

6.  Data collection period
Thousand Acre data collection began January 1, 1995.  Debidue Creek sampling 
began March 5, 1998. Oyster Landing data collection began in 1995; however, it 
was not considered a SWMP site until 1996 when the collection site was switched 
from Caledonia to Oyster Landing. Clambank sampling began in February 1981 
through June 1995; however, it was not considered a SWMP site until sampling 
resumed in August of 2001 (08/17).  All sampling is ongoing.

7. Distribution
According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy 
for the NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program, NOAA/ERD retains the right to 
analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of the NERRS System-wide Monitoring 
Program data.  The PI retains the right to be fully credited for having 
collected and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standards, the PI 
and NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and fully 
acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any part of the data are 
used.  Manuscripts resulting from the NOAA/OCRM supported research that are 
produced for publication in open literature, including refereed scientific 
journals, will acknowledge that the research was conducted under an award from 
the Estuarine Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource 
Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.  The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only 
as good as the quality assurance/quality control procedures outlined by the 
enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for 
its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons.  The Federal 
government does not assume liability to the Recipient of third persons, nor will 
the Federal government reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for its liability 
due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data.

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the general 
information link on CDMO homepage) and online at the CDMO homepage  
http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu.  Data are available in text tab-
delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format.

8.  Associated researchers and projects
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core-monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  Thousand Acre is our permanent monitoring station 
for the NERR monitoring program, but Oyster Landing and Debidue Creek were also 
sampled beginning in 1998. These stations are also included in our NIW core-
monitoring program.

A long-term fish survey is also done at the Oyster Landing site bi-weekly.  
Species present, total weight, individual weights and standard lengths of fish 
that utilize the marsh at high tide are recorded.  In the winter months 
(November through February), this sampling is done only once monthly.

The NERR weather station is also located at the Oyster Landing site.  Air 
temperature and humidity, barometric pressure, solar radiation (total and PAR), 
wind speed and direction, and precipitation are measured.

prevented adequate flow of water over the sonde's remaining probes resulting in 
a reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations, reduced ph, and reduced 
salinity.  However, post deployment calibration checks for all probes were 
perfect (see section 13), which indicates probes were working properly. All data

that it intermittently parked over optics, or debris stuck on the wiper obscured 
the optics.  Spikes greater than 1000 NTU were deleted during this period.

OYSTER LANDING

a). For the following dates and times, dissolved oxygen data were deleted from 
Oyster Landing due to a tear in the membrane during the deployment.

11/04/03 11:30 through 11/06/03 12:00

b).  For the following date and time the datalogger recorded negative depth 
data. However, specific conductivity and salinity sensor readings suggest that 
the datalogger was not out of the water. Suspect that the negative value 
indicates shallow depth due to extreme high winds holding the tide out (11/28/03 
max wind 40 mph, 11/29/03 23 mph) and is simply due to a slight calibration 
error.  Data were retained.

11/29/03 07:00

c).  For the following dates and times, turbidity data were greater than 1000.  
This is due to a wiper motor malfunction and subsequent parking over optics.  
All values greater than 1000 were deleted.

CLAMBANK CREEK

No anomalous data for this month. See Section 14 for further documentation.

12. Missing Data 

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks:

THOUSAND ACRE

01/22/03 14:00 There was a jump in pH after deployment of a different sonde at 
Thousand Acre.  Suspect that this is due to a slight calibration difference 
between the two sondes and not any natural fluctuation in pH levels.

02/23/03 A prolonged wind event affected tidal depth on 2/23/03, preventing the 
tide from rising to a normal level.  This event also affected water temperature.  
This event was evident at all sites.

03/03 For the month of March, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Thousand Acre Marsh.  

04/03 A prolonged wind/storm event affected tidal depth on 04/06-07/03 (23:30-
00:00) keeping the tide at a higher than normal level (high and low tide).  This 
event was evident at all sites.

04/03 For the month of April, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Thousand Acre Marsh, suppressing salinity to fresh-water 
concentrations (<3ppt) for the entire month.

04/07/03 11:30:00 There was a jump in pH after deployment of a different sonde 
at Thousand Acre.  Suspect that this is due to a slight calibration difference 
between the two sondes and not any natural fluctuation in pH levels.

05/03 For the month of May, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, pH and turbidity data at Thousand Acre Creek.  Heavy & frequent 
rains coupled with increased riverine discharge into Winyah Bay lowered salinity 
levels to fresh-water concentrations for the beginning of the month with 
slightly elevated salinity levels during mid-month spring tides.  Rain events on 
5/6/03 (0.82") and 5/16/03 (0.43") caused noticeable spikes in turbidity on 
those dates.

07/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 07/23/03 at Thousand Acre Marsh, 
preventing the tide from rising to a normal level. This event was evident at 
Oyster Landing, Clambank Creek and Debidue Creek as well. 

08/03 A storm event on 08/18/03 effected temperature, pH and depth data at 
Thousand Acre Marsh for that day.  This storm produced heavy rains (2.1") and 
heavy winds (20 mph hourly av.).

09/03 During the month of September, the effects of several tropical systems 
(Hurricane Isabel, Hurricane Fabian, Tropical Depression Henri) are evident in 
all water quality parameters measured at Thousand Acre Marsh. 

10/03 For the month of October, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH data at Thousand Acre Marsh. 

11/03 Due to a probe malfunction, turbidity data between 11/18/03 14:30 and 
12/02/03 12:00 were collected using a 6026 turbidity probe rather than a 6136 
turbidity probe.  

11/03 For the month of November, precipitation effects were obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, pH and DO data, while wind effects were obvious in depth data at 
Thousand Acre Marsh.

12/03 Due to a turbidity probe malfunction, turbidity data between 12/01/03 
00:00 and 12/02/03 12:00 were recorded measured with a 6026 turbidity probe 
rather than a 6136 turbidity probe.

12/03 For the month of December, precipitation effects were obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data, while wind effects were obvious in depth data at Thousand 
Acre Marsh.

CLAMBANK CREEK

01/03 For the month of January, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

02/23/03 A prolonged wind event affected tidal depth on 2/23/03, preventing the 
tide from rising to a normal level.  This event was evident at all sites.

03/03 For the month of March, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, pH, and turbidity data at Clambank Creek.  Most noticeable are the 
effects of the 03/20/03 storm which dropped >5 inches of rain in ~2 hours (5.75" 
measured at Oyster Landing weather station).  

04/03 A prolonged wind/storm event affected tidal depth on 04/06-07/03 (23:30-
00:00) keeping the tide at a higher than normal level (high and low tide).  This 
event was evident at all sites.

04/03 For the month of April, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

05/03 For the month of May, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and pH data at Clambank Creek.

05/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 5/31/03 through 6/1/03, preventing 
the tide from rising to a normal level.  Depth readings affected were between 
5/31/03 17:00 and 6/1/03 2:00. This event was evident at Oyster Landing and 
Debidue Creek as well.

07/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 07/23/03 at Clambank Creek, 
preventing the tide from rising to a normal level. This event was evident at 
Oyster Landing, Thousand Acre Marsh and Debidue Creek as well.     

07/03 For the month of July, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Clambank Creek.

08/03 A storm event on 08/18/03 effected temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity  
and depth data at Clambank Creek for that day.  This storm produced heavy rains 
(2.1") and heavy winds (20 mph hourly av.).

09/03 A jump in dissolved oxygen concentration on 9/26/03 is due to the 
instrumentation being switched out at that site.  There was a noticeable drift 
in dissolved oxygen concentrations during September due to an extended 
deployment of the instrument and excessive fouling during that period.

09/03 During the month of September, the effects of several tropical systems 
(Hurricane Isabel, Hurricane Fabian, Tropical Depression Henri) are evident in 
all water quality parameters measured at Clambank Landing. 

10/03 For the month of October, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data at Clambank Creek.  

10/03 A jump in dissolved oxygen concentration on 10/16/03 is due to the 
instrumentation being switched out at that site. 

11/03 A shift in pH was evident with the change-out of sondes at Clambank Creek.

11/03 For the month of November, precipitation effects were obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, pH and DO data, while wind effects were obvious in depth data at 
Clambank Creek.

12/03 A shift in pH was evident with the change-out of sondes at Clambank Creek.
 
12/03 For the month of December, precipitation effects were obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data, while wind effects were obvious in depth data at Clambank 
Creek.

DEBIDUE CREEK

02/03 During the second deployment in February, average pH was recorded as 
approximately 0.2 lower than the first deployment in the month.  This is due to 
a failing pH probe on the second deployment.  The pH probe was changed after 
retrieval, but data were not affected enough to merit deletion.

02/23/03 A prolonged wind event affected tidal depth on 2/23/03, preventing the 
tide from rising to a normal level.  This event was evident at all sites.

03/03 During the second deployment in February, average pH was recorded as 
approximately 0.3 higher than the first deployment in the month.  This is due to 
a failing pH probe on the first deployment (see 02/03 note above).  The pH probe 
was changed after retrieval.  Data were not affected enough to merit deletion.

03/03 For the month of March, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and pH data at Debidue Creek.  Most noticeable are the effects of 
the 03/20/03 storm which dropped >5 inches of rain in ~2 hours (5.75" measured 
at Oyster Landing weather station).  

04/03 A prolonged wind/storm event affected tidal depth on 04/06-07/03 (23:30-
00:00) keeping the tide at a higher than normal level (high and low tide).  This 
event was evident at all sites.

04/03 For the month of April, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Debidue Creek.

05/03 For the month of May, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Oyster Landing.

06/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 6/1/03 at Debidue Creek, preventing 
the tide from rising to a normal level. This event was evident at Clambank Creek 
and Oyster Landing as well.

06/03 For the month of June, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Debidue Creek.

07/03 For the month of July, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Debidue Creek.  A major storm event on 7/19/03 dropped 
6.11" of rain (recorded at Oyster Landing MET station).    

07/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 07/23/03 at Debidue Creek, preventing 
the tide from rising to a normal level. This event was evident at Clambank 
Creek, Thousand Acre Marsh and Oyster Landing as well.

08/03 A storm event on 08/18/03 effected salinity, conductivity and depth data 
at Debidue Creek for that day.  This storm produced heavy rains (2.1") and heavy 
winds (20 mph hourly av.).

09/03 A jump in dissolved oxygen concentration on 9/29/03 is due to the 
instrumentation being switched out at that site.  There was a noticeable drift 
in dissolved oxygen concentrations during September due to an extended 
deployment of the instrument and excessive fouling during that period.  

09/03 During the month of September, the effects of several tropical systems 
(Hurricane Isabel, Hurricane Fabian, Tropical Depression Henri) are evident in 
salinity and depth data measured at Debidue Creek.

10/03 For the month of October, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data at Debidue Creek.

11/03 For the month of November, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity and pH data, while wind effects are obvious in depth data at 
Debidue Creek.  

12/03 For the month of December, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and pH data, while wind effects are obvious in depth data at 
Debidue Creek.  

OYSTER LANDING

02/23/03 A prolonged wind event affected tidal depth on 2/23/03, preventing the 
tide from rising to a normal level.  This event was evident at all sites.

03/03 For the month of March, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and pH data at Oyster Landing.  Most noticeable are the effects of 
the 03/20/03 storm which dropped >5 inches of rain in ~2 hours (5.75" measured 
at Oyster Landing weather station).  

04/03 A prolonged wind/storm event affected tidal depth on 04/06-07/03 (23:30-
00:00) keeping the tide at a higher than normal level (high and low tide).  This 
event was evident at all sites.

04/03 For the month of April, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Oyster Landing.  These storm events also lowered dissolved 
oxygen levels at Oyster Landing (possibly due to silt-laden runoff), evident in 
readings for 04/06-07/03 and 04/25-26/03. 3.04 inches of rain fell on 04/25/03 
alone.

05/03 For the month of May, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and pH data at Debidue Creek.

06/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 6/1/03, preventing the tide from 
rising to a normal level. This event was evident at Clambank Creek and Debidue 
Creek as well.

06/03 For the month of June, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity and 
conductivity data at Oyster Landing.

07/03 For the month of July, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and pH data at Oyster Landing.  A major storm event on 7/19/03 
dropped 6.11" of rain (recorded at Oyster Landing MET station).

07/03 A wind event affected tidal depth on 07/23/03 at Oyster Landing, 
preventing the tide from rising to a normal level. This event was evident at 
Clambank Creek, Thousand Acre Marsh and Debidue Creek as well.

08/03 A storm event on 08/18/03 effected temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity  
and depth data at Oyster Landing for that day.  This storm produced heavy rains 
(2.1") and heavy winds (20 mph hourly av.).

09/03 During the month of September, the effects of several tropical systems 
(Hurricane Isabel, Hurricane Fabian, Tropical Depression Henri) are evident in 
all water quality parameters measured at Oyster Landing. 

09/03 A jump in dissolved oxygen concentration and pH on 9/26/03 is due to the 
instrumentation being switched out at that site.  There was a noticeable drift 
in dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH during September due to an extended 
deployment of the instrument and excessive fouling during that period.   

10/03 For the month of October, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity, 
conductivity, and turbidity data at Oyster Landing. 

11/03 For the month of November, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data, while wind effects are obvious in depth data at Oyster 
Landing.   

12/03 For the month of December, precipitation effects are obvious in salinity 
and conductivity data, while wind effects are obvious in depth data at Oyster 
Landing.
