2.  Entry Verification:
The data is directly downloaded in a spreadsheet format from the YSI 6600 
datalogger to a PC.  Removing the headers, footers, and spaces on a PC creates 
edited files.  Missing data from YSI 6000 maintenance (downtime) is inserted 
into the spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Data and graphs are 
visually inspected to find possible anomalies.  Edited and raw files are 
currently stored on 3.5-inch diskettes.  [Edited and raw data will be archived 
and stored on IBM 41T workstation].  Data files were QA/QC'd using Excel 5.0 
CDMO macros. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically 
format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow 
PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file from a 
two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis. 
Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged 
monthly files are also transferred to NERRS Central Data Management Office.  
Michael Mensinger is responsible for the editing and archiving of these data.

3.  Research Objectives:
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for Delaware Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water 
quality over time. The three sites chosen for monitoring will assist in 
understanding the impacts of both urban and agricultural impacts on the 
watersheds.  Scotton Landing, Lebanon Landing, and Division Street are located 
within the St. Jones River watershed, while the Blackbird Landing component is 
located in the Blackbird Creek watershed.  Measurements are taken every 30 
minutes over two week collecting periods at the Scotton Landing (SL), Blackbird 
Landing (BL), Lebanon Landing (LL), and Division Street (DS) sites.

4.  Research Methods:
The YSI 6000 datalogger monitoring program was started in July 1995 at Scotton 
Landing (St. Jones River) and Blackbird Landing (Blackbird Creek).  In June 1996 
Penrose Branch (St. Jones River Basin) was added to the monitoring program. 
Penrose Branch sampling was later discontinued on December 26, 2001. In January 
2002 the Lebanon Landing, and Division Street sites were added to 
the monitoring program.  Prior to deployment, a 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC pipe 
was mounted to a piling at Scotton Landing and a bridge at Blackbird Landing 
using stainless steel brackets and bolts.  These methods were also used to 
install a pipe to a piling at the Lebanon Landing dock, and the pumping station 
bank wall at Division Street. Each YSI 6600 is lowered into the PVC pipe that 
has eight (8) two-inch diameter holes cut out at the bottom for the probes to 
have direct contact with the water column.  A large stainless steel bolt was 
placed at the bottom end of the PVC pipe which maintained each YSI 6600 at each 
site exactly one foot (30 cm) above the river bottom.  Every half-hour over a 
two-week period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and water level are recorded.  
Seven days after the deployment of each YSI 6600, the dissolved oxygen membrane 
is cleaned with a Kimwipe dipped in methanol.  Two-week sampling intervals were 
selected due to limitations created by the dissolved oxygen membrane. At the end 
of each two-week period, the YSI 6600 is brought back to the office for 
downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Calibrations performed include: 
dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity using Oakton 12,880 uS standard, 
turbidity using AMCO AEPO-1 Standard at 100 NTU and distilled water, pH using 
Fisher pH 4.00, 7.00 and 10.00 buffers, and depth.  These procedures are carried 
out according to the methods as described in the YSI Model 6600 Operating and 
Service Manual.  After approximately six hours of down time for cleaning and 
recalibration, the YSI 6600's are redeployed for another two-week period. Data 
files are QA/QC'd using Excel 5.0 CDMO macros.  Edited files are merged to 
contain one full month of data.  Edited and merged monthly files are also 
transferred to NERRS Centralized Data Management Office.


5.  Site location and character:
The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component 
sites, the St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are 
located along the Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located 
in central Kent County Delaware, east of the State Capitol City, Dover.  The 
Blackbird Creek component is located in the unincorporated area of Southern New 
Castle County.  There are four sampling sites, three located in the St. Jones 
component and one in the Blackbird Creek component.

1) Scotton Landing - is located in the Lower St. Jones River at the Scotton 
Landing Public Fishing Pier, just up stream of Delaware Route 113.  The river is 
22.3 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an average depth of 4m MHW and 
the width is 50 m. At the sampling site, the depth is 3.2 m MHW and the width is 
40 m. The sediment is clayey silt with no bottom vegetation. The watershed-
draining site is 19778 ha. The site is influenced by freshwater runoff from the 
relatively urbanized area upstream. Pollutants in the area include PCB's, PAH's, 
and pesticides.

Salinity ranges from 1- 30 ppt.
Tidal Range: Spring Mean (m) - 1.26
Neap Mean (m) - 1.13
Position: 	Latitude 39 degree 05'  05.9160"  N                              	
		Longitude  75 degree 27'  38.1049"  W

2) Blackbird Landing - is located in the upper Blackbird Creek at Blackbird 
Landing Road.  The creek is 25.8 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an 
average depth of 3 m MHW, and an average width of 90 m. At the sampling site, 
the depth is 1.8 m MHW and width is 110 m. The sediment is silty clay with no 
bottom vegetation. The watershed draining site is 4694 ha. The site is 
influenced by freshwater runoff from unimpacted forested areas intermixed with 
agricultural land uses and a small amount of low-density development.  There is 
very little pollutant presence in the area.

3) Lebanon Landing- is located in the mid portion of the St. Jones River at the 
Lebanon Landing Public Fishing Pier, farther upstream from the Scotton Landing 
monitoring site. The St. Jones River is 22.3 km long (mainstream linear 
dimension), has an average depth of 4m MHW and the width is 50 m. At the 
sampling site, the depth is 3.0 m MHW and the width is 
28 m. The sediment is clayey silt with no bottom vegetation. The watershed-
draining site is 19778 ha. The site is influenced by freshwater runoff from the 
relatively urbanized area upstream. Pollutants in the area include PCB's, PAH's, 
and pesticides. .

		 Longitude   75 degree 29'  57.1"  W

4) Division Street- is located in the upper portion of the St. Jones River near 
the USGS station on Division Street. The site is influenced by runoff from the 
urbanized surroundings. The St. Jones River is 22.3 km long (mainstream linear 
dimension), has an average depth of 4m MHW and the width is 50 m. At the 
sampling site, the depth is 0.6m MHW and the width is 
26 m. The sediment is clayey silt with no bottom vegetation. The site is fresh 
water and is influenced by urban freshwater runoff. The watershed draining site 
is 4694 ha. Pollutants in the area include PCB's, PAH's, and pesticides.

8.  Associated researchers and projects: 
An extensive stormwater sampling and hydrodynamic modeling project is underway 
in the upper reaches of the St. Jones River Basin.  This project includes flow 
weighted stormwater sampling to quantify pollutant loads from each of the major 
land uses found in the Basin.
An additional stormwater sampling program is underway to analyze the impact of 
agricultural BMP's at sites in the Blackbird Creek Watershed, St. Jones River 
Watershed. 
A joint effort underway through NOAA's Center for Coastal Ecosystem Health and 
the DNERR characterization studies will initiate detailed monthly water quality 
sampling at three sites in each river over a two year period and will quantify 
the phytoplankton community with collections from the same sites.   This project 
was scheduled to be initiated in February 1995.

The reliability of the dissolved oxygen (DO) data after 96 hours post-deployment 
for non-EDS (Extended Deployment System) data sondes may be problematic due to 
fouling which forms on the DO probe membrane during some deployments
(Wenner et al. 200*).  Many Reserves have upgraded to YSI 6600 EDS data sondes, 
which increase DO accuracy and longevity by reducing the environmental effects 
of fouling.  The user is therefore advised to consult the metadata and to 
exercise caution when utilizing the DO data beyond the initial 96-hour time 
period.  However, this potential drift is not always problematic for some uses 
of the data, ie. periodicity analysis. It should be noted that the amount of 
fouling is site specific and that not all data are affected.  The Research 
Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be contacted concerning the 
reliability of the DO data because of the site and seasonal variation in the 
fouling of the DO sensor. All data sondes used at DNERR sites in 2002 were non-
EDS models.

The NERRS System-Wide Monitoring Program utilizes YSI data sondes that can
be equipped with either depth or water level sensors.  Both sensors measure 
water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to atmospherically vented 
measurements and depth refers to non-vented measurements.  Standard calibration 
protocols for the non-vented sensor use the atmosphere pressure at the time of 
calibration.  Therefore, changes in atmospheric pressure between calibrations 
appear as changes in water depth.  The error is equal to approximately 1.03 cm 
for every 1millibar change in atmospheric pressure.  This error is eliminated 
for level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere throughout the 
deployment time interval.  If proper atmospheric pressure data is available, 
non-vented sensor depth measurements can be corrected for deployments between 
calibrations. Readings for both vented and non-vented sensors are automatically 
compensated for water density changes due to variations in temperature and 
salinity.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site should be 
contacted in order to obtain information regarding atmospheric pressure data 
availability. All data sondes used at the DNERR sites in 2002 were non-vented 
models.

14. Other Remarks/Notes


a) D.O probe warm up times were discussed at the 2002 NERR Technician Training 
Session. It was agreed that the entire system would employ a 60 second warm up 
time for the DO sensor. Sonde start times are now set 1 minute prior to desired 
reading time to compensate for the 60 second warm up period. Warm up times were 
changed as follows: Scotton Landing (deployment on February 21, 2002), Lebanon 
Landing (deployment on February 01, 2002), Division Street (deployment on 
January 31, 2002), and Blackbird Landing (deployment on February 06, 2002). 
Autosleep functions were also checked on these dates and turned on wherever 
necessary.

b) A new model 6136 turbidity probe was introduced in 2002 by YSI. This new 
probe will replace the old 6026 model. The dates of change for each site are as 
follows: Scotton Landing (deployment on March 12, 2002), Lebanon Landing 
(deployment on March 12, 2002), Division Street (deployment on April 03, 2002), 
Blackbird Landing (deployment on March 06, 2002). Model 6026 probes acted as 
stand ins due to 6136 calibration difficulties/probe failure at the following 
sites at these date time ranges:

(a) Lebanon Landing:
- September 04, 2002 12:30:00 through September 19, 2002 09:00:00
(b) Scotton Landing:
- December 18, 2002 14:30:00 through January 08, 2003 08:00:00
(c) Division Street:
- August 06, 2002 13:30:00 through August 21, 2002 08:00:00
- August 21, 2002 14:30:00 through September 04, 2002 06:00:00
- September 04, 2002 12:00:00 through September 19, 2002 09:30:00

c) Calibration procedures changed with the introduction of the new turbidity 
probe model. The turbidity probe must now be 3 inches from calibration fluid cup 
bottom. The calibration fluid cup will now always sit directly on a black 
surface (prior procedure used cup suspended over black surface). 

d) YSI introduced a new sonde guard with the new turbidity probes. The new guard 
measures 8 1/2" and will replace the old 6 1/2" guard. Please note the 2" 
difference between the new and old guards in regards to depth data. Guard change 
dates are synonymous with turbidity probe change dates.

e) Raw data file llwq040302.csv contains corrupted times from March 20, 2002 
18:00:00 to end of March when imported into program. Times were copied and 
pasted to fix time column.

f) Sonde software was updated from version 2.14 to version 2.16 for the 
following 6600 series sondes: Scotton Landing (March 12, 2002), Lebanon Landing 
(March 12,2002), Division Street (March 12, 2002), Blackbird Landing (March, 
07,2002)

g) The sonde time for Lebanon Landing was changed (set back 10 minutes) on June 
11, 2002.

h) The sonde time for Scotton Landing was changed (set back 1 minute) on July 
09, 2002.

i) The sonde time for Blackbird Landing was changed (set ahead 7 minutes) on 
July, 31, 2002.

j) There were a few instances at this NERR site where turbidity recorded small 
negative values (-0001). Because turbidity has a range of accuracy of +/-2 NTU, 
the technician did not edit or deleted these values in any way.
