2) Entry verification 
The CDMO Weather Data Management Program was used to QA/QC the data, verified by John Haskins. 

a) Data Input Procedures:
   
   The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each instrument on the 
weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO Data Logger Program 
(nerr.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection schedule 
(see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The CR10X then
interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by Campbell Scientific.  Data are saved in the 
Campbell Scientific format on both computer and backed up onto compact disc. A common error 
that is encountered is wind speeds below 0.5 m/s.  The storage module is manually brought 
into the lab and downloaded. Two storage modules are used so no data is lost while downloading 
data from the module.
      Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP)
was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic
to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section
for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly
raw data file into and Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First,
it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it 
checks the data against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  
Finally, it produces error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are 
noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in
the Data Correction section below.  
	The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation
		data that are totalized from 5-second samples sorted by date and time. 
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum with time
		(arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted by date and 
		time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour totals calculated
		from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).
	ii) 15 minute sample point parameters: Date, Time, Air Temperature (°C), Relative Humidity
	(%), LiCor (PAR), Barometric Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), Wind Direction (Array 150);
	Rainfall (mm) (Array 151)

	v) Daily Average parameters: Date, Time, Air Temperature (°C), Relative Humidity (%),
	Barometric Pressure (mb) (Array 241); Wind Speed (m/s), Wind Direction, Wind Direction
	Standard Deviation (using Yamartino's Algorithm) (Array 242)
	vi) Daily Total parameter: LiCor (PAR) (Array 245); Rainfall (mm) (Array 246)
	vii) Daily Maximum parameters: Date, Time, Air Temperature (°C), Time, Relative Humidity
	(%), Time, LiCor (PAR), Time, Barometric Pressure (mb), Time, Wind Speed (m/s), Time, 
	Battery Voltage, Time (Array 243)

3) Research objectives: 
   The principle objective is to record long-term meteorological data for Elkhorn Slough to 
observe any environmental changes or trends over time. These data are also collected as a 
part of a county wide monitoring program and are made available for researchers that may 
be interested in them.

4) Research methods:
   The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every five seconds to produce both hourly
and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric
pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction. An instantaneous sample is taken every 
15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150. The data module is retrieved approximately 
every four weeks and replaced with a new module with full storage capacity. At this time all
sensors are inspected and cleaned if necessary. The tipping bucket is periodically covered 
in debris and this is removed at each site visit when necessary. The retrieval of the data 
module is done at the same time the water quality monitoring station is collected. This 
ensures the storage module is not overloaded with data and begins to rewrite over the data.
Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at a minimum of 
every two years. There were no other analyses done on the meteorological data at present.

5) Site location and character:
   The Elkhorn Slough NERR is located on the central California coast at the head of the 
Monterey Bay. There is one weather station on the reserve that is located approximately 
one kilometer south of the South Marsh water quality site. The coordinates for this station 
are 38° 48' 55.44" N, 121° 44' 16.8" W.  The sensors are located on a 
10 ft tower placed according to descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual V 4.0 and are 
located approximately 200 feet above the marsh on a bluff in the uplands of the marsh. 
The tipping bucket is located to the west away from the tower. There are no shadow or 
wind obstructions from buildings or trees in the immediate area surrounding the location
of the sensors.

6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected since September 18, 1998. 

7) Distribution
According to the Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Dissemination Policy for the 
NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program,

NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of the NERRS System-wide
Monitoring Program data.  The PI retains the right to be fully credited for having collected 
and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standards, the PI and NERR site where 
the data were collected will be contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent publications
in which any part of the data are used.  Manuscripts resulting from the NOAA/OCRM supported 
research that are produced for publication in open literature, including refereed scientific 
journals, will acknowledge that the research was conducted under an award from the Estuarine 
Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, National Ocean Service, 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The data set enclosed within this 
package/transmission is only as good as the quality assurance/quality control procedures outlined
by the enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for its 
subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons.  The Federal government does not
assume liability to the Recipient or third persons, nor will the Federal government reimburse
or indemnify the Recipient for its liability due to any losses resulting in any way from the 
use of this data.

NERR weather data and metadata can be obtained from the Research Coordinator at the individual 
NERR site (please see Section 1 Principal investigators and contact persons), from the Data 
Manager at the Centralized Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the 
general information link on the CDMO home page) and online at the CDMO home page 
http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu.  Data are available in text format. 

8) Associated researchers and projects:
Rain data from the weather station are shared with the Naval Post Graduate School who in turn 
organize these data from many stations in the county. These weather data are also combined with 
water quality data for analysis and correlations with rain events.
