2.	Entry Verification (Done by S. Phipps):

	Data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 Data loggers and graphs are produced using the PC6000 
software.  Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from probe failure.  Notes are made of 
any unusual data, and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .prn files using 
the PC6000 software.  The .prn files are imported into EXCEL, edited by removing headers and footers, 
and saved as EXCEL files.  Data at the beginning and end of each data record that were recorded when 
the instruments were out of the water are deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document 
the times in and out of the water, and by unusual depth data (usually negative or near zero).  The 
appropriate files are merged to form complete monthly data sets and are saved as separate EXCEL files.  
Data that are missing because the instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are 
denoted by periods (.).  These times are noted in section 11 (Missing Data) of this document  Two types 
of post-calibration values are also used to determine operational viability of the sensors while deployed.  
One is obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values 
given by the Data loggers.  The second type is obtained in the field using a newly calibrated Data logger.  
Data from this instrument are recorded in the field at the time of the last scheduled reading by the Data 
loggers.  Both post-calibration values are reported in section 12 (Other Remarks/Notes) of this 
document, and may be used to determine the quality of the data recorded by the instruments (particularly 
DO) after two weeks in the field.  Any erroneous data that are identified as being caused by probe failures 
(as determined upon examination of the data plots, or by post-calibration values) are deleted and replaced 
with periods, and noted in section 11 (Missing Data) of this document.  Sensor readings that greatly 
deviate from known values of standards after the two week deployment are not necessarily believed to be 
a result of probe failure, however.  If biofouling is believed to be the reason for poor agreement between 
the sensors and the standard values at the end of a deployment, the data are retained and noted in section 
10 (Data Anomalies) of this document.  Symptoms of probe failures are extreme noise in the record, 
unrealistically high or negative data, or noisey or negative readings in standard solutions.  Examples of 
many such failures are given in the CDMO Manual (Version 3.0). .  Finally, the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros (update 
version 11/96) are then run on these new monthly files to identify missing times and/or dates, to format 
the width and decimal places of columns, and to identify outliers and other erroneous data. Scott Phipps is 
responsible for all data management.

3.	Research Objectives/Study Purpose:

	The Data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 minutes.  
Presently, two instruments are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve.  One is located at the mouth of Fish 
River (provides ~73% of Weeks Bay's freshwater), and the other is located the eastern side of Weeks 
Bay, near the mouth.
	Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon Secour Bay.  
Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show that bottom waters (which flow into 
Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic in summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also 
in question, as largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during periods of 
high river flow.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if poor water quality periodically observed in 
Weeks Bay is generated within the bay proper, or is being washed in from Fish River or Bon Secour 
Bay with changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these two sites may be 
used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.

4.	Research Methods:

	Data loggers are moored on private docks.  At each dock, a PVC tube is attached to a piling at the 
end of the dock using ratchets equipped with zinc disks (to help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A 
chain, attached to the cap of the tube, is shackled to the bail of the Data logger.  Chains and tubes were 
cut to a length that places the Data logger probes just below the bottom of the tube and 0.5 m above the 
sediment when in place.  A nylon rope tied to the bottom of the piling also runs through the tube and is 
attached to the bale of the Data logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the Data loggers in the 
event that the tube breaks away from the piling.
	The Data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved 
oxygen (DO) percent saturation and concentration, pH, and water level every 30 minutes (central 
standard time [CST]).  A newly calibrated Data logger is also used to record the above parameters at the 
same time the deployed YSI takes its first reading to insure initial accuracy of the YSI.  The instruments 
are usually serviced (instruments post-calibrated, data uploaded, instruments cleaned and recalibrated) 
every 14 days; however, they are programmed to log for 30 days in the event they cannot be serviced on 
schedule.  Just before deployment, window screening (1mm mesh size) is wrapped once around the cage 
that protects the sensors, and secured with plastic cable ties.  Window screening is also secured in the 
bottom of the cage with silicone sealant.  This is done to reduce error in the data that may be due to larger 
animals moving in and out of the cage during the deployment.  This does not, however, preclude smaller 
animals such as barnacle and polychaete larvae from entering the cage and settling on the sensors.
	Before the Data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated Data logger is lowered to the depth of the 
deployed instrument, and readings are logged at the same time that the deployed instruments are 
programmed to record.  Post-calibration values are obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in 
standard solutions and recording the values given by the Data loggers.
	Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as described in the YSI 
Operating Manual (addendum 7/94, sections 3, 4, and 7).  Calibration standards, required for pH and 
salinity, are purchased from a scientific supply house.  Dissolve oxygen is calibrated using a calibration 
cup filled with about 1/2 cm tap water, which creates a 100% water-saturated air environment for the 
sensors when the sonde is placed in the cup.  The sensors are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 
minutes in the cup before DO (%Saturation) is calibrated.  Servicing the instruments results in a period of 
about 2 hours of missing data every two weeks at site FR, and a period of 3 to 4 hours of missing data 
every two weeks at site WB.

5.	Site Location and Character:

	Weeks Bay (30 23' N, 87 50' W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, located on the 
eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It is nearly diamond shaped, and its 
longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) runs nearly north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to 
the mouth, where water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near the 
center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side of Weeks Bay.  Average 
depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths are significantly greater.  The first is in the 
mouth of the bay, where the average depth is 6 m; the second is about 200 m upstream of the mouth of 
the Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally diurnal, and have a mean range 
of 0.4 m.
	The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 1.43 x 108 m2 and contributes approximately 73% to 
the total incoming freshwater flow;  the Magnolia River supplies the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 
m3 s-1; although freshets up to 4 times larger occur aperiodically throughout the year.  These 
characteristics result in a freshwater residence time of 13 days under average discharge conditions, with a 
range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  
During periods of high river flow, salinities in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, except 
in the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  However, during periods of low river 
flow wind velocity and tidal stage are strong factors influencing salinity structure.  Salinities greater than 
25 ppt are rarely observed in Weeks Bay, and are usually restricted to the southern portion of the estuary 
near the mouth.
	Site FR (Fish River; 30 25'00" N, 87 49'24" W) is located at the mouth of Fish River at a mean 
depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there are small patches of Vallisineria, spp. growing 
near (but not directly under) the Data logger.  Land use in the water shed is largely agricultural, with 
some residential use.  Directly surrounding the site, land use is largely public and semi-public.  Nutrient 
concentrations at this site are variable and may be quite high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations 
ranging from approximately 4-90 µM and <0.5 to 7.5 µM, respectively, over the previous 10 years 
(Alabama Department of Environmental Management).  Over the past year, salinity ranged from 0.0 to 
16.5 ppt at this site.
	Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 22'52" N, 87 49'57" W) is located near the south-eastern shore of the 
Weeks Bay, about 0.5 miles from the mouth of the estuary.  Mean water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; 
sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land use around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture 
occurring inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at site FR; over the past year, 
nitrate and phosphate concentrations here ranged from 0.1 to 42 µM and 0.04 to 0.45 µM, respectively.  
Salinity ranged from approximately 0 to 22 ppt over the past year.  

6.	Data Collection Periods:

	The Data loggers were first deployed at both sites on 27 October 1995, and have been 
continuously in service since then.

7.	Associated Researchers and Projects:

	Weeks Bay Reserve established twenty-four volunteer water quality monitoring sites in the 
watershed in May 1995.  These sites are monitored once every two weeks for fecal coliform counts, 
secchi depth, DO concentration, temperature, pH, alkalinity, hardness, and at some sites salinity.

				membrane on probe.
			At site WB post deployment calibration of pH probe was negative for deployment 
				1/2/97 to 1/16/97, however, data appear normal. 
February 1997:  	At site FR DO record is very noisey towards the end of deployment 1/28/97 to

			At site WB barnacle fouling bad throughout the month, barnacle found on the DO 
				membrane at end of deployment 2/13/97, sp. cond. and salinity post 
				calibration very unstable at end of deployment 2/27/97. 
March 1997:		At site WB barnacle set reported on 3/13/97; DO data from 			
				2/26 - 3-13 may have been compromised.
			At site WB sonde stopped recording data on 3/21/97 due to battery failure, and 
				data from earlier portion of the deployment (3/13/97 to 3/21/97) may be 
				suspect.

				the hour, reason unknown.
April 1997: 		At site FR construction of a bulkhead began near this site on or about 4/11/97 and 
				proceeded for approx. 2 weeks.
			At site FR at end of deployment 4/11/97 to end of month, sensors were very 
				muddy (perhaps due to bulkhead construction) and data may have been 
				compromised.
			At site WB 4/1/97 through 4/24/97; barnacles, mud and tubeworms were quite 
				bad during these deployments, data may have been compromised.
May 1997:		At site FR none to report
			At site WB No DO (% sat or mg/l) data 4/24/97 13:45:00 through 4/30/97 23:45:00 due
				to malfunctioning sensor, wildly erratic outlier data were deleted upon 
				recomendation from YSI upon their receipt and evaluation of the sensor.
June 1997:		At site FR none to report
			At site WB barnacle set reported on 6/5/97; DO data from 5/22 - 6/5

July 1997:		At site FR sonde taking data at 00:05:34 and 00:35:34, 7/31 to 8/14; this problem 
				recurring in the same sonde (and only that sonde) periodically, reason 
				unknown.

				data may have been compromised from 7/3 - 7/17.
August 1997:		At site FR sonde taking data at 00:05:34 and 00:35:34, 7/31/97 to 8/14/97 and 
				from 8/14/97 to 8/28/97 at 00:01:24 and 00:31:24; reason unknown. 
			At site WB probes and cage heavily fould by mud and tube building worms on 
				8/14/97; DO data may have been compromised.

				at the ends of deployments.
			At site WB heavy biofouling all month at each service, data may be compromised 
				at the ends of deployments.
October 1997:		At site FR much fouling during the portion of the month that data were recorded 
				(see section on missing data) but data seems okay.
			At site WB worm inside pH probe 10/8/97, pH data suspect from 9/25 - 10/8
November 1997:		At site FR pH data is suspect from 12/18/97 12:30:00 till the end of the month; 
				probe would only calibrate at pH 7.0, would not calculate slope, on post 
				calibration probe initially gave negative readings and then slowly rose to 
				normal.
			At site WB none to report
December 1997:		At site FR Do record erratic on 12/3 and 12/4
			At site WB probes may have been out of the water or very close to the surface 
				several times during the deployment 12/18 - 1/6 due to very low tides, 
				causing erratic pH, DO, Salinity, and conductivity readings.
* = Please note #2 in General Information.

General Information:
1.	While we have always set the Data loggers to record 2 times per hour, we have changed logging 
times over the course of the past year.  Because a ferry was used to reach the sites, several logging 
intervals were tried before we came to the final interval that best fit the ferry schedule (logging at 15:00 
and 45:00 past the hour).  As the ferry is no longer used,  we have returned to logging at 00:00 and 
30:00 past the hour, and have done so regularly since November 1997.

2.	We have deleted data only when technical difficulties resulted in questionable data.  Therefore, 
we feel that extreme caution should be used when evaluating these data (especially DO % sat. and 
concentration) because of problems with biofouling.  Particularly during the summer months, biofouling 
can cause severe degradation of the DO and conductivity calibrations over the two week deployments (eg: 
07/18/96 site WB) at times recording negative DO values.  At times the DO deviation from calibration at the end of a two week deployment was 
greater than 80% ( in a water-saturated air environment).  We have made note of any data that we 
consider to be suspect because of biofouling, based on post-calibration values reported by the sensors.  
We also have provided the control sonde readings that were taken in the field at the time of the final 
logging interval before retrieval of the deployed Data loggers, as well as the post-calibration values (for 
details see section 4, above) in section 12 (Other Remarks/Notes) below.  We encourage anyone using 
the deployment data to first compare them to these discrete control sonde readings and post-calibration 
values on the given dates before evaluating the data.  If the user desires, it is possible to use these data to 
correct the deployed YSI data using regression analysis.  If not, then the user should delete compromised 
data at his or her own discretion.
