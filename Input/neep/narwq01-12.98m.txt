2.  Entry verification.

Other water quality measurements are made by standard field methods at the time 
of datalogger deployment and weekly thereafter.  Results are compared with YSI 
6000 data records.  Data may be corrected based on the comparative analyses and 
is then so noted in the data anomaly section of the metadata form. 

Temperature is measured by mercury thermometer calibrated with a NBS certified 
thermometer.  Dissolved oxygen is determined by a modified Winkler titration.  
Salinity is measured with a Hydrolab Surveyor 3 equipped with a salinity/ 
conductivity sensor.  The pH is determined by a Corning benchtop pH meter.  
Turbidity is presently measured with a Secchi disk.  (This method does not 
provide data that is comparable to the YSI data.  An appropriate method 
recommended by the manufacturer and accepted by the scientific community will be 
used in the future.)  Allan Beck is responsible for these water quality 
measurements.

Data is uploaded to a PC from the YSI datalogger using the PC6000 software in 
both the PC6000 format and in comma delimited format.  The comma-delimited data 
is opened in Excel 5.0 and edited to remove headers and extra spaces.  Each file 
contains a month's data and missing days are denoted by periods.  

3.  Research objectives.

YSI6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve's (NERR) Water Quality 
Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop long-term data sets for 
representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over 
time. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on 
season, and measurements are taken every 30 minutes.  Currently one station on 
Prudence Island, Potters Cove in the north has been established.   Potters Cove 
site, which was established in December 1995 receives waste from boaters and is 
considered an impacted site.  All Rhode Island State waters, however, were 
declared a federal no-discharge zone (for marine sewage) in late Spring 1998.  
It is now illegal for boaters to discharge treated or untreated sewage into 
waters of the state, including Potters Cove.

4.  Research Methods.

Before each deployment, routine maintenance and calibration of the YSI 
instrument are carried out.  The instrument is cleaned to remove any fouling and 
the probes are checked for cracks or other visible signs of damage.  O-rings are 
cleaned and greased, and batteries installed.  Calibrations are performed for 
salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, depth, and turbidity.  For the salinity 
calibration, filtered seawater from Narragansett Bay is collected and its 
salinity determined using an autosal.  This seawater is then used as a salinity 
standard. A two-point pH calibration is performed using pre-made buffer 
solutions of pH 7 and 10 obtained from Fisher Scientific. Old pH solutions are 
used for rinsing the probes.  The dissolved oxygen membrane is replaced 24 hours 
prior to calibration.  The DO probe is then calibrated by placing a wet sponge 
in the calibration cup and allowing the instrument to equilibrate as per the 
manufacturer's instructions for 100% air saturation calibration.  The depth 
sensor is calibrated to sea level with the sonde standing up in air, calibration 
cup removed.  The turbidity sensor is calibrated with distilled water (NTU = 0).  
In August 1998, turbidity sensors were calibrated with distilled, deionized 
water (0 NTU) and a standard diluted with distilled, deionized water to 10 NTU.  
As  of December 28, 1998, a three point turbidity calibration was instituted (0, 
10, 100 NTU).  

Currently only a northern site, Potters Cove, is being monitored. The sondes are 
deployed in PVC tubes with sections cut out to allow water flow.  The PVC tube 
is attached to a dock.   The sondes are programmed to collect data every 30 
minutes during deployment.  Deployments generally last two weeks to four weeks, 
data collection is continuous unless some mishap occurs.  At the end of each 
deployment, the data is uploaded, put in Excel format, and QA/QC'd using the 
Excel Macros provided by the CDMO.  

5.  Site Location and Character.

The NARNERR consists of 2200 acres of diverse estuarine and terrestrial habitats 
ranging from deep water to salt marshes to forested uplands.  The land holdings 
include 60% of Prudence Island, most of nearby Patience Island and all of Hope 
Island off the west shore of Prudence.  The Reserve is located close to the 
geographical center of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.

10.  Data anomalies.

January, 1998:
	PC: No alterations were made to the data, no anomalies were noted.

	TW:  Sonde was lost at sea on 12/30/97 and not recovered until late Fall 
1998.  Data was collected for a portion of January while the sonde, but is not 
reported here since it is not possible to determine the unit's exact location 
even though it evidently remained in the vicinity of the T-Wharf where it was 
eventually recovered.

February, 1998: 
	PC: DO values noted as high, especially on 2/13/98 but were left in the 
data set.  These DO values may be a result of fouling.  Did note that DO and 
temperature seemed to track from 2/26/98 to end of month, but again, no data 
were deleted.
	 
March, 1998:
	PC: No data anomalies noted, no data deleted.
	 
April, 1998:
	PC: DO values noted as high from 04/07/98 17:00 hr, but again left in.
	 
May, 1998:
	PC: DO data seemed high on 5/16/98 through 5/19/98 but this was part of a 
continuous deployment from 5/06/98 through end of month. Rapid decline in water 
temperature on May 7 - May 8 may have been due to a passing storm.  Sonde was 
deployed continuously from May 6 through end of month. 

June, 1998:
	PC:  Begin turbidity probe deployment 6/05/98 with 1 point calibration (0 
NTU); no turbidity data prior to 06/05/98.  Turbidity spike on June 12, 2100 hr. 
is anomalous.  Puncture in DO membrane resulted in deletion of anomalous data 
from 6/20/98 19:00 hr through 6/26/98 7:30 hr.   Extreme negative turbidity 
value (-656) on 6/30/98 18:00 hr deleted.  NB:  There were severe rains during 
this month resulting in a monthly total of over 12.00 inches.  One rain storm 
left over 4 inches over the course of a weekend.  

July, 1998
	PC:  High DO values noted for 7/1/98 through 7/13/98; values exceeded 200% 
saturation and were deleted.   A clear puncture caused extreme DO values that 
were deleted from 7/23/98 00:00 hr until 7/24/98 8:30 hr.  Large negative 
turbidity values were deleted on 7/3/98 17:00 hr (-81.9 NTU) and on 7/5/98 4:30 
hr (-702.9 NTU).  Turbidity spike on July 22 0100 hr deemed an anomalous event.  
From 7/13/98 through 7/24/98, sonde actually logged parameters at 9:52 minutes 
after the half-hour.  

August, 1998:
	PC:  Several internal device errors occurred throughout deployment of 
sonde from 8/12/98 through 8/24/98 possibly due to power supply malfunction.  
This resulted in large gaps of missing data.  However, consultation with YSI 
technical support indicated that the data that were collected at this time 
should be of satisfactory reliability.  Data stream regained on 8/24/98 when a 
different sonde was deployed.  DO membrane punctured 8/25/98 2:30 hr resulting 
in deletion of DO data from that point through the end of the month.  Large 
negative turbidity value on 8/11/98 13:30 hr. was deleted. Turbidity spike on 
August 30 1030hr deemed an anomalous event. 

September, 1998:
	PC:  Several rows of data were not gathered due to gaps in deployment:  on 
9/9/98 at 6:30 hr through 9:00 hr. and on 9/23/98 at 8:30 hr and 9:00 hr.  
Despite use of three different sondes through the course of the month, punctures 
or other problems developed so that DO data collected was significantly above 
realistic levels (e.g. 400%).  As a result of these difficulties, all DO data 
collected for the month was deleted.  :(  Turbidity spikes on September 8, 
1900hr and September 19, 1600 hr deemed anomalous events.

October, 1998:
	PC: DO data deleted from 10/1/98 through 10/12/98 7:30 hr since this was 
the same sonde deployment continued from September.  See September 1998 data 
anomaly section for full explanation. Turbidity spikes on October 1, 1500hr; 
October 10, 1730hr; and October 13, 1930hr deemed anomalous events.

November, 1998
	PC:  Power malfunction in sonde for deployment of 11/18/98 through end of 
month.  No data collected for this period.  :(  Low DO values noted for 11/5/98, 
but not deleted since these data were from one sonde deployed continuously from 
10/28/98 through 11/18.  

December, 1998
	PC:  Power malfunction in sonde for deployment 12/01/98 through 12/2/98 
14:30 hr., no data obtained for this period.  Negative turbidity values (-1 NTU 
when rounded) occurred at the following times and were converted to 0 values:  
12/30/98 from 10:30 hr through 21:00 hr; 12/31/98 00:00 hr through 8:00 hr and 
10:30, 11:00, 12:00, 12:30, 15:00, 15:30, 16:30, 17:30, 18:30, 19:30, 20:00, 
21:00 and 22:00 through 23:30 hr.  Turbidity spike on December 10, 1730hr deemed 
an anomalous event.


11.  Missing Data
	
January, 1998:
	PC:  No turbidity data were collected this month.

	TW:  Sonde was lost at sea on 12/30/97 and not recovered until late Fall 
1998.  Data was collected for a portion of January while the sonde, but is not 
reported here since it is not possible to determine the unit's exact location 
even though it evidently remained in the vicinity of the T-Wharf where it was 
eventually recovered.

February, 1998: 
	PC:  No sonde deployed 2/20/98 11:30 hrs until 2/26/98 12:30 hrs.  No 
turbidty data collected for whole month.
	 
March, 1998:
	PC: No turbidity data were gathered during the entire month.	 

April, 1998:
	PC:   No turbidity data were gathered during the entire month.  Missing 2 
rows of data (4/09/98 09:30 hrs and 10:00 hrs) between deployment of sondes. 

May, 1998:
	PC:  Missing data between deployments 5/1/98 15:00 hr until 5/6/98 08:30 
hr.  No turbidity data taken for the whole month 

June, 1998:
	PC: No turbidity data prior to 06/05/98.   Maintenance period 6/4 11:30 – 
6/5 08:00.  Puncture in DO membrane resulted in deletion of anomalous data from 
6/20/98 19:00 hr through 6/26/98 7:30 hr.   Maintenance period 6/26 08:00 – 6/27 
08:30.  Extreme negative turbidity value (-656) on 6/30/98 18:00 hr deleted. 

July, 1998
	PC:   Missing data between deployments: 7/24/98 9:00 hr and 7/24/98 9:30 
hr.  High DO values noted for 7/1/98 through 7/13/98; values exceeded 200% 
saturation and were deleted.   A clear puncture caused extreme DO values which 
were deleted from 7/23/98 00:00 hr until 7/24/98 8:30 hr.  Large negative 
turbidity values were deleted on 7/3/98 17:00 hr (-81.9 NTU) and on 7/5/98 4:30 
hr (-702.9 NTU).

August, 1998:
	PC:  Several internal device errors occurred throughout deployment of 
sonde from 8/12/98 through 8/24/98 possibly due to power supply malfunction.  
This resulted in large gaps of missing data.  DO membrane punctured 8/25/98 2:30 
hr resulting in deletion of DO data from that point through the end of the 
month.  Large negative turbidity value on 8/11/98 13:30 hr. was deleted.  

September, 1998:
	PC:  Several rows of data were not gathered due to gaps in deployment -- 
on 9/9/98 at 6:30 hr through 9:00 hr. and on 9/23/98 at 8:30 hr and 9:00 hr.  
Despite use of three different sondes through the course of the month, punctures 
or other problems developed so that DO data collected was significantly above 
realistic levels (e.g. 400%).  As a result of these difficulties, all DO data 
collected for the month was deleted.  



October, 1998:
	PC:  Missing data for 10/28/98  9:00 hr. as a result of deployment 
mismatch.  DO data deleted from 10/1/98 through 10/12/98 7:30 hr since this was 
the same sonde deployment continued from September.  See September 1998 data 
anomaly section for full explanation.  

November, 1998
	PC:  Power malfunction in sonde for deployment of 11/18/98 through end of 
month.  No data collected for this period.  

December, 1998
	PC:  Power malfunction in sonde for deployment 12/01/98 through 12/2/98 
14:30 hr., no data obtained for this period. 

12.  Other Remarks/Notes
	Probe failures have resulted in the loss of much dissolved oxygen and 
turbidity data, particularly in the summer.  Membrane puncture during deployment 
has also caused losses in DO data.  We are currently working on ways to more 
effectively keep animals out of the probe guards.  Meshes used to date seem only 
to trap animals once they get past the mesh.
