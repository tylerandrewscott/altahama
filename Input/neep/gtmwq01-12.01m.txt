2) Entry verification:

Data are uploaded to a PC from the YSI Model 6600 data sonde and graphs are 
produced using EcoWatch software Version 3.13.  EcoWatch is used to plot the 
data and perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min, max, mean, std dev).  
Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from probe failure.  Notes 
are made of any unusual data, and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Each 
data file is exported as a comma delimited file (.cdf) using EcoWatch software.  
Two copies of this .cdf file are saved in the .csv format; one file is used to 
archive the raw data, whereas the second file is edited to adjust the time to 
read exactly at the top or bottom of the hour (e.g., 00:00:00; true times on 
sondes were 00:00:40 past the top and bottom of the hour), to remove headers and 
footers, and to delete data at the beginning and end of each record when the 
instruments were out of the water.  These latter data are identified by field 
notes that document the times in and out of the water, together with depth and 
conductivity values near zero.  Sonde clocks had been incorrectly set to 
Daylight Savings Time for many deployments; therefore, several data files 
required further editing to convert all time values to Eastern Standard Time.  
Files for each deployment that required this time adjustment are marked with an 
asterisk in section 6 (Data collection period).

Using the edited .csv files, monthly data are compiled and processed by various 
macros distributed by the CDMO.  These macros are designed to: 1) check data 
files for missing data points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods (.), 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, 
date and numeric variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range 
for the sensors, 5) save the files as Excel worksheets (*.xls) and 6) generate 
single parameter monthly graphs.Anomalous data are evaluated to determine 
whether to flag or delete the suspect values.  Data are flagged if the values 
are: 1) outside the range expected for the site, or 2) outside the range of 
measurements established for the sensors (see Table 1).  Data outside the 
"normal" range of water quality parameters for a particular site were 
investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, 
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  Data are deleted if the anomalies 
are attributed to sensor malfunction.  In addition to observations of any 
physical damage (e.g., a torn DO probe membrane), sensor malfunctions are 
detected if the voltage reading of the probe is outside the range established 
for the sensor or the sensor will not calibrate.  After corrections are made to 
the monthly Excel worksheet (*.xls), the edited files are exported as tab-
delimited files (*.txt) and sent to the CDMO.  Raw data (*.csv) files are also 
sent to the CDMO for archiving.  Laura Wick is responsible for these tasks.


3) Research objectives:

To begin the SWMP initiative in the GTM NERR it was desirable to establish one 
permanent station in both the northern and the southern sections of the reserve.  
The stations needed to be somewhat centrally located to be representative of the 
conditions within that region.  Existing Channel Markers in the Atlantic 
Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) were selected as the preferred mounting locations.  
Sondes at the Pine Island site are deployed in a PVC pipe fixed to Channel 
Marker 25 (30° 03.050´N; 81° 22.048´W) in the Tolomato River.  This site is 
located within the Guana River Marshes State Aquatic Preserve in the northern 
section of the GTM NERR.  Channel Marker 25 is adjacent to Pine Island near the 
mouth of Deep Creek, which provides freshwater drainage from uplands in the 
northwestern portion of the Tolomato River Basin.  Sondes at the Fort Matanzas 
site (in the southern section of the GTM NERR) are deployed in a PVC pipe fixed 
to ICW Channel Marker 75 (29° 44.220´N; 81° 14.762´W) in the Matanzas River.  
This site is located 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north of the Matanzas Inlet and is near 
a shoreline on Anastasia Island that is undergoing residential development.  
Both the Matanzas River and Tolomato River sites are within Class II Shellfish 
Harvesting Waters.


4) Research methods:

YSI 6600 data sondes have been continuously operated (data collection interval: 
30 minutes) at each of the two permanent monitoring stations in the GTM NERR 
since December 2000.  At each site the sonde is contained within a 4 inch 
diameter PVC pipe mounted vertically on a channel marker piling.  A steel pin at 
the bottom end of the pipe holds the sonde at a postion within 1 meter from the 
bottom.  To facilitate water flow across the sensors, several 2 cm diameter 
holes were drilled into the submerged portion of the pipe.  Hole density is 
greatest near the base where the sonde sensors are located.  To avoid heavy 
fouling, sondes were exchanged more frequently during the summer than in cooler 
months (see deployment times in section 6: Data collection period).  Exchanges 
usually took less than 5 minutes, thus no planned downtime occurred.  At the end 
of a sampling period, sondes were returned to the laboratory where post-
deployment readings and reconditioning took place in accordance with the methods 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  After a superficial rinse of 
the sonde in tap water, post deployment readings were recorded for temperature 
and in standards for pH (Fisher 7.00 and 10.00 buffer solutions) and 
conductivity (Exaxol 25.00 or 50.00 mS/cm standard); a post-deployment turbidity 
reading in 100.0 NTU standard was recorded after a more thorough rinse of 
the turbidity sensor.  This rinse was done to avoid contamination of the NTU 
standard.  The results of these post-deployment readings were used to evaluate 
the validity of data (see Tables 4 and 5).  The dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane 
was replaced and allowed to equilibrate for 24 hours before the DO sensor was 
pre-calibrated in water-saturated air for the following deployment.


5) Site location and character:

The GTM NERR (North section [NW and SE corners]: 30.1632º N, 81.3447º W and 
29.9698º N, 81.2488º W; South section: 29.8295º N, 81.3294º W and 29.6017º N, 
81.1936º W), located in the Florida Upper East Coast Drainage Basin, includes 
approximately 55,000 acres of publicly owned forested uplands, tidal wetlands, 
estuarine lagoons and offshore seas.  Geographically separated by the greater 
St. Augustine area, the Reserve is associated with the riverine systems of the 
Tolomato and Guana River estuaries to the north and the Matanzas River 
estuary to the south.  The Tolomato River Basin is about 18 miles (29 km) in 
length with a drainage area of approximately 53,802 acres; it converges with the 
Matanzas River and Salt Run from the south before flowing into the Atlantic 
Ocean at the St. Augustine Inlet.  The headwaters of the Guana River originate 
in the Diego Plains drainage area in Ponte Vedra Beach.  This drainage basin 
encompasses approximately 7,800 acres.  The Guana River runs parallel to the 
Tolomato on the seaward side, with the two lagoons joining 7 miles (11.3 km) 
north of the St. Augustine Inlet.  The Matanzas River estuary is approximately 
20 miles (32 km) in length and extends 8 miles (13 km) south of the Matanzas 
Inlet.  The Matanzas River sub-basin has a drainage area of approximately 
103,615 acres and is bounded to the west by the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, which 
separates it from the lower St. Johns River basin.  Both the St. Augustine and 
Matanzas Inlets provide oceanic exchange to the system.  The Matanzas Inlet, one 
of the last "natural" inlets on Florida's east coast, has been unimproved and is 
suitable only for small watercraft.  The natural hydrology of the Guana Tolomato 
Matanzas system has been somewhat altered by water control structures, including 
dikes, inland wells, drainage ditches and a dam across a portion of the Guana 
River.  In addition, the Intracoastal Waterway traverses both the Tolomato and 
Matanzas estuaries.
The climate of northeast Florida is classified as humid subtropical and is 
characteristic of the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plain of the Southeastern United 
States.  The average annual rainfall is approximately 52 inches per year, with 
the wet season extending from June through September.  Seasonal variation in 
temperature within the Reserve follows that of rainfall with a summer period of 
high temperatures between June and September and a cooler period extending 
from December through March.  The annual mean air temperature within the Reserve 
is approximately 21ºC.  During 2001, water depth at both the Pine Island and 
Fort Matanzas sites ranged between 1.5 and 4.0 m.  Mean depth at the Pine Island 
site was 2.8 +/- 0.5 m (+/- S.D.; n=15463) with an average monthly tidal range 
of +/- 1.0 m.  Similarly, the meandepth at the Fort Matanzas site was 2.6 +/- 
0.4 m (+/- S.D.; n = 15162) with an average monthly tidal range of +/- 0.9 m.  
Depth is recorded as the amount of water above the sensors, which are located 
less than 1 m above the bottom at both sites.  During 2001, salinity at the Fort 
Matanzas site ranges between 11.6 and 37.2 ppt; the mean was 34.6 +/- 2.3 ppt 
(+/- S.D.; n = 15162) with an average monthly range of +/- 4.5 ppt.  Salinity at 
the Pine Island site ranged between 6.3 and 38.4 ppt; the mean was 31.3 +/- 6.5 
ppt (+/- S.D.; n = 16980) with an average monthly range of +/- 5.5 ppt.
Initial observations suggest that the benthic structure within the GTM NERR 
ranges from silty sediment to hardbottom habitat including the eastern oyster 
Crassostrea virginica, sponges, and hard and soft corals.  The benthic habitat 
surrounding the Pine Island site is composed of dynamic fine grain sediment.  A 
hardbottom community comprised primarily of oysters, sponges, and corals exists 
at the Fort Matanzas site.  A more detailed analysis of benthic structure will 
be presented in future metadata reports.

Station Locations:
The Pine Island (gtmpinut) station is at Channel Marker 25 (30º 
03.051´N; 81º 22.048´W) in the Tolomato River.  

The Fort Matanzas (gtmfmnut) site (in the southern section of the GTMNERR) is located at 
Channel Marker 75 (29º 44.222´N; 81º 14.757´W) in the Matanzas River.


6) Data collection period:

Data sondes were first deployed on December 21, 2000 at the Pine Island site and 
December 26, 2000 at the Fort Matanzas site, and have been continuously in 
service since then.  All monitoring is considered long-term.  Individual sonde 
deployment and retrieval dates and times for 2001 are as follows:

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The GTM NERR has formed partnerships with other agencies and organizations 
actively involved in resource protection in the GTM NERR watershed.  Cooperating 
managers of lands within the NERR include:  1) National Park Service (NPS), 2) 
St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD), 3) Department of 
Environmental Protection (DEP) Division of Recreation and Parks/Florida Park 
Service (FPS), 4) DEP Aquatic Preserve Program, 5) Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission, and 6) Flagler County.  The SJRWMD Northern Coastal 
Basin Program, established in 1995, covers the watersheds along the Intracoastal 
Waterway from Ponce Inlet in Volusia County, north through Flagler and St. Johns 
Counties, to the Guana River marshes at Ponte Vedra in southern Duval 
County. This program was developed in response to concerns about the impacts of 
population growth and development on water quality in the Northern Coastal Basin 
(NCB).  Some of the major research activities conducted within the boundaries of 
the NERR through the NCB program include: 1) a fisheries monitoring project in 
conjunction with United States Geological Survey, 2) hydrodynamic modeling of 
the estuarine systems, and 3) water quality monitoring.  
Many of the water quality monitoring and assessment activities of the NCB 
program are aimed at pollution source identification and the development of 
pollution load reduction goals.Other water quality research and monitoring 
initiatives within the GTM NERR include: 1) studies of nutrient profiles by the 
laboratory of Dr. Edward Phlips at the University of Florida (this work 
compliments and extends the GTM NERR's SWMP nutrient monitoring efforts), and 
2) regular monitoring of fecal coliform levels in shellfish harvesting waters by 
the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.NERR-specific research 
projects currently in progress include: 1) a CICEET funded study by Dr. Jody 
Harwood at the University of South Florida to develop a real-time, fiber-optic 
biosensor for human pathogens in estuarine waters, 2) a NERR-funded graduate 
research project to decipher the parameters affecting reforestation of spoil 
islands, 3) a NERR-funded graduate research project to develop an estuarine 
planning strategy through an assessment of human use patterns together with a 
delineation of ecological resources, and 4) a collaboration with the 
National Weather Service in Jacksonville and University of North Florida to test 
a web-enabled, wireless communication system for real-time data acquisition from 
field instruments.

Data columns are separated by tabs.  Each file contains a two line
column header at the top of the page which identifies measurements and 
units for each column.

10) Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions:

File definitions: YSI deployment site/month/year (e.g., FMWQ0301 = monthly data 
from the Fort Matanzas site for March of 2001).  PI = Pine Island; FM = Fort 
Matanzas.  


11) Anomalous data:
  	
Note that slight shifts in data are sometimes correlated with sonde exchanges.  
These shifts are most noticeable in pH, specific conductivity, salinity, DO% and 
DO conc, and may be related to sensor drift (e.g., due to fouling) and/or 
calibration differences between sondes.

PI
a)	Deleted all depth data between 01/01 at 00:00:00 and 1/31 at 23:30:00 
(entire month) - plastic wrap on sonde (to prevent fouling) interfered with 
depth gauge operation.

March 1-31, 2001
PI
a)	Deleted DO data between 3/14 at 04:00 and 3/16 at 12:30 due to 
the accumulation of  fouling organisms on the DO membrane.
b)	pH data from 3/01 at 13:30:00 to 3/16 at 12:30:00 may be suspect since 
bulb was found broken upon retrieval.
c) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
03/15/2001	17:00:00	1029

FM
a)	Missing data on 3/8 at 13:00:00 due to sonde exchange.
b)	Increased turbidity readings between 3/15 at 00:00:00 and 3/22 at 10:30:00 
may be related to local rain events.
c)	Data from all sensors were deleted on 3/22 at 14:00:00 and 14:30:00 due to 
an apparent sonde failure.

April 1-30, 2001
PI
a)	The conductivity and salinity data for 4/11 at 13:00:00 maybe an artifact, 
but were not deleted.  The same parameters were suspect between 4/20 10:00:00 
and 4/26 at 12:00:00.  The irregular profile may be due to local rain events.
b)	Drift in turbidity may have occurred between 4/09 17:30:00 and 4/12 
13:30:00, reason unknown.

May 1-31, 2001
PI
a)  	Drop in specific conductivity and salinity on 5/25 at 01:00:00, reason 
unknown.  The same parameters also dropped between 5/7 at 17:00:00 and 5/10 at 
14:30:00 possibly due to the combination of exceedingly high amounts of mud and 
worm casings on the conductivity sensor as well as local rain events.  A similar 
decrease in specific conductivity and salinity occurred between 5/29 at 23:30:00 
and 5/31at 03:30:00, possibly due to local rain events.
b)	One crab and one blenny were found within the sensor guard upon retrieval 
on 5/24.
c) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
05/28/2001	03:00:00	1207

FM
a)	Data missing from 5/20 04:00:00 until 5/31 23:30:00 due to battery 
failure.
b)	Drop in specific conductivity and salinity occurred between 5/06 at 
15:30:00 and 5/13 at 01:00:00 likely due to local rain events.

June 1-30, 2001
PI
a)	Several small crabs and fish were found within the sensor guard upon 
retrieval on 6/18.
b)	Turbidity and DO data were deleted between 6/20 at 18:30 and 6/29 at 09:00 
due to evidence of partial burial of the sonde in fine sediments together with 
barnacle fouling of the DO membrane when retrieved on 6/29.  Benthic sediment 
movements appeared to be dynamic throughout the month.  Field observations 
suggest that specific conductivity and therefore, salinity measurements may be 
affected by high amounts of silt on the conductivity sensor.

FM
a)	Data were missing from 6/01 00:00:00 until 6/15 10:30:00 due to battery 
failure.
b)	Two small crabs were found within the guard when retrieved on 6/29. 

July 1-31, 2001
PI
a)	Data from 7/30 09:30:00 to 7/31 23:30:00 were not collected due to a 
programming error.
b)	Deleted pH data between 7/12 14:00:00 and 7/20 12:30:00.  Pre-calibration 
readings were not out of range, but the readings were low (8.69 for a 10.00 
buffer solution).  Post-calibration reading for the pH 7.0 buffer was also low 
(4.49).
c)	Suspect specific conductivity and salinity data between 7/03 16:00:00 and 
7/05 11:00:00 due to high amounts of mud associated with the sonde at retrieval. 
d)	Suspect specific conductivity and salinity data between 7/10 at 00:00:00 
and 7/12 at 13:30:00.  This decline is possibly associated with local rain 
events, but the interpretation is complicated by the presence of high amounts of 
mud and small crabs found within the guard upon retrieval.
e)	A crab was found within the sensor guard upon retrieval on 7/20.
f) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
07/28/2001	14:00:00	1377
07/28/2001	22:30:00	1105

FM
a)	The shift in the pH data at 7/5 15:00:00 is possibly due to calibration 
differences between the deployed and retrieved sondes.
b)	One large (width: 2.5 inches) and one small (width: 1 inch) crab was found 
within sensor guard upon retrieval on 7/13 and 7/23, respectively.
c)	Rain events were frequent between 7/10 and 7/26.  These events likely 
affected the salinity readings at this time.
d) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
07/17/2001	05:30:00	1488

August 1-31, 2001
PI
a)	Data were not collected between 8/01 00:00:00 and 8/06 10:00:00 due to a 
programming error.
b)	Missing data 8/31 09:30:00 due to the deployment/retrieval sonde exchange 
process.
c)	One small crab (width: 0.25 inch) found within sensor guard upon retrieval 
on 8/24.

FM
a)	One large (length: 4 inches) blenny was found within the sensor guard upon 
retrieval on 8/31.  Apparently, the fish damaged the DO membrane on 8/31 at 
01:00:00.  DO% and DO conc data were deleted between 8/31 at 1:00:00 and 8/31 at 
12:30:00 when the sonde was retrieved.  

September 1-30, 2001

Tropical storm Gabrielle passed near the GTM NERR on 9/15.  Rain events occurred 
between 9/11 and 9/15 with a peak in rainfall on 9/13 (information is based on 
Stokes Landing rain gauge maintained by the St. Johns River Water Management 
District).

PI
a)	Data are missing at the following times: 9/08 08:30:00, 9/08 17:00:00, and 
9/27 14:00:00.  Dropouts on 9/08 occurred with the same sonde -  reason is 
unknown; the missing data point on 9/27 was due to sonde exchange.

FM
a)	Data are missing between 9/17 13:30:00 and 9/18 16:30:00, on 9/19 between 
7:00:00 and 11:00:00, between 9/22 12:30:00 and 9/22 14:00:00, between 9/23 
11:00:00 and 9/23 16:00:00, between 9/24 13:30:00 and 9/24 17:30, and between 
9/25 00:00:00 and 9/30 23:30:00 - apparently due to faulty sonde.

October 1-31, 2001
PI
a)	Deleted DO% and DO conc data between 10/17 at 03:30:00 and 10/18 at 
12:30:00 due to a torn DO membrane.  Crabs found within the sensor guard upon 
retrieval on 10/18 most likely damaged the DO membrane.
b) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
10/16/2001	04:30:00	1290

FM
a)	Data are missing from 10/01 00:00:00 to 10/05 13:00:00 apparently due to a 
faulty sonde (note missed ranges in September at Fort Matanzas occurred during 
the same deployment period).
b)	Two  crabs (width: 0.5 inches) were found within the sensor guard upon 
retrieval on 10/22.
c) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
10/28/2001	08:30:00	1369

November 1-30, 2001

A northeastern storm event may be responsible for the increase in water depth 
and decrease in salinity seen in November.  Rain events were common between 
11/12 and 11/14 with a peak on 11/14, based on the Stokes Landing rain guage.

PI
a)	Missing data between 11/16 13:30:00 and 11/20 14:30:00.  PVC sonde housing 
and cap were damaged, therefore, deployment was delayed until the cap and lock 
were replaced.
b)	A few small crabs and moderate barnacle growth was discovered on the 
sensors and within the sensor guard upon retrieval on 11/2.
c) Turbidity outliers for the following dates and times were not deleted:
11/12/2001	03:00:00	1363

FM 
a)	Data are missing from 11/27 04:00:00 until 11/30 23:30:00 due to battery 
failure.
b)	Deleted DO% and DO conc data between 11/13 at 17:30:00 and 11/20 at 
09:30:00 due to discontinuity.  It is suspected that the DO membrane was damaged 
since the DO values dropped precipitously to negative values, however there were 
no field or laboratory notes to confirm this.

December 1-31, 2001
PI
a)	DO data are suspect between 12/1 at 12:30 and 12/1 at 14:00.  The reason 
for the low values is unknown.
b)	Data are missing on 12/21 13:00:00 due to sonde exchange.
c)	Deleted turbidity data between 12/14 00:00:00 and 12/21 12:30:00 
due to a blenny (length: 4 inches) and high number of deposited 
eggs/mud casings found on the sensors and within sensor guard upon retrieval on 
12/21.

a)	Data missing from 12/01 00:00:00 to 12/07 12:00:00 due to battery failure. 
b)	A blenny (length: 4 inches) was found within the sensor guard and both the 
DO membrane and pH bulbs were missing upon retrieval on 12/21.  Consequently, 
the data described below (c and d) were deleted.
c)	Deleted DO% and DO conc. data between 12/17 at 05:30:00 and 12/21 at 
15:00:00 and then again between 12/22 at 14:00:00 to 12/31 at 23:30 due to a 
torn DO membrane. 
d)	Deleted pH data between 12/17 at 00:00:00 and 12/21 at 15:00:00 due to 
broken pH bulb.
e)	Suspect specific conductivity and salinity data on 12/25 at 05:00:00,

g) The steep drop in DO between 12/21 18:30 and 12/21 21:00 may be related to 
similar drops observed at both the Pine Island and Fort Matanzas sites at 
various periods throughout the year.  This interesting phenomenon is 
currently being studied in more detail to identify possible causes.


12) Missing data:  

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  For details on deleted data, see 
"Anomalous data" (Section 11).  For more details about missing data, contact 
the Research Coordinator.
