2) Entry Verification Process:

The data are uploaded using the computer program EcoWatch that accompanies the 
YSI 6000 series dataloggers.  After the file is uploaded from the water quality 
instrument, EcoWatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.dev.).  This information is printed out 
and attached to the Field Log for the particular deployment. This printout is 
used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the 
water quality instrument was removed from the water or those caused by 
instrument failure. The data are exported as a .csv file and then opened into 
a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative recordings. 
When a complete month of data has been recorded the file is then reviewed.  The 
first step is to format the data so that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order and the data have the correct number of decimal place holders. The 
CDMO 5.0 Excel macro is used to check for any dates and times that data were not 
recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates and 
times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where 
data would normally be. An explanation for the missing data is recorded onto the 
Water Quality Editing Log.  Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro to 
find readings outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range 
for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are removed from the 
file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing 
dates and times are recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside 
the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site were investigated for 
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, 
and instrument diagnostics. If the data are rejected from the file a period is 
inserted into the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and times are 
recorded onto metadata form.  The metadata form is then submitted with the data 
file to the CDMO.  Tara Nye, Research Biologist, was responsible for data 
management during 2001.  


3) Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island 
components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve and are 
anchored to the bottom of the selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30-
minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. These sites are relatively 
unimpacted by manmade perturbations and are considered long term monitoring 
locations.  The goal is to establish long-term water quality monitoring at 
relatively unimpacted sites by collecting data for each day of the year. 


4) Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March 1992 at the 
Masonboro Island component, and 19 May 1994 at the Zeke's Island component. The 
procedures described below were instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover 
data recorded previously. At this time we are only performing long term water 
quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed 
following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections 
3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are only required for pH, turbidity and 
salinity; all other parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer 
solutions for a two-point pH calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased pre-made 
from a scientific supply house. The conductivity standard is obtained from YSI. 
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to 
settle at least 24 hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in the 
field observation log. The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked 
steel cage, then anchored approximately 10cm off the bottom, and chained to a 
post at the monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 
measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, pH, and 
turbidity. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is brought back to 
the laboratory.  The weather and water quality measurements are again noted in 
the field observation log. The calibration drift and the effect of biofouling on 
the water quality instrument are checked by comparing data readings in 
calibration standards. The water quality data are then uploaded, and the 
instrument is cleaned and calibrated as noted previously. 


5) Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(from north to south) are: 
Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island. They are 
located along the southeastern coast of the United States in the Atlantic Ocean. 
Currently, only data from Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island components are 
transferred to the CDMO. 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of Whiskey
Creek, and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a small navigable channel 
called Research Creek at 34° 09'21.7" latitude and 77° 50'59.9" longitude. The 
site has a salinity range from 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 
meters.  The creek bottom is characterized by sand and detritus based sediment 
with areas of soft mud with a depth ranging from 0.34 to 2.45 m.  The sole 
source for freshwater is rain.  Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, 
which is relatively unimpacted by manmade perturbations and is not accessible to 
road traffic.  The site does experience minimal boat traffic.  


2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island
The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal Point boat launch in a 
tidal basin estuary at 33( 56'23.5" latitude and 77( 56'28.1" longitude. This 
site receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear River 
through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies of water.  The site 
has a salinity range from 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2 meters.  
Depth varies, but typically it can be found to range from 0.11 to 2.30 meters.  
Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus based sediment.  There are 
no pollutants from land.  The site is surrounded by marsh and dunes, not 
accessible to road traffic and minimal boat traffic.


6) Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while East Cribbing data 
collection commenced on 19 May 1994. All monitoring is considered long term.

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zekes Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserves historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.

11) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section lists and explains all anomalous (suspect) data that has either 
been deleted or still remains in the data set.  The data are either extreme for 
the aquatic system being monitored or are outside the measurement range of the 
instrument. The cause of such anomalies may be a bad calibration, boat traffic 
disturbances, malfunction of the instrument, or the measurements may be correct.

All parameters missing due to sonde exchange on the following date and time.
01/12/01 11:00

Anomalous specific conductivity, salinity and DO data, possibly due to fouling.  
Consider this data suspect.  However, it's possible that the sensors are 
responding to a real event.
01/01/01 00:00 - 01/12/01 10:30

Anomalous pH data possibly due to fouling.  Consider these data suspect.  Data 
were retained.
01/11/01 13:00 - 01/12/01 10:30 

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

During the following dates, DO data were noisy, due to membrane puncture.  Data 
deleted.
02/15/01 21:00 - 02/28/01 12:00

Anomalous specific conductivity data were noted during the following dates, just 
prior to retrieval.  Within an hour, specific conductivity values increased in 
relatively large increments from 39 to 46 to 51 mS/cm.  Data were retained.
02/28/01 11:30-12:30

During the following date the turbidity data point was outside of the sensors 
range.  The datum was retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered 
by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, March

During the following dates specific conductivity, DO, turbidity and pH all seem 
to be responding to something, possibly caused by sediment and fouling.   When 
the sonde was retrieved, it was covered with sediment and algae, and smelled of 
sulfur.  In the presence of sulfur, the DO probe will not work properly.  
Sensors tested OK during post deployment calibration check.  Data were retained.  
03/13/01 18:30 - 03/22/01 11:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

All parameters missing data due to sonde exchange.
04/11/01 12:30

An anomalous DO data point was recorded at the following date and time.  Do not 
know if this was an error or if a real event caused a sudden drop in DO.  The 
data point was retained.
04/08/01 22:30 3.6%

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, May

During the following time period DO data were noisy, due to a membrane puncture.  
DO data were removed.
05/05/01 13:00 - 05/09/01 11:30

During the following dates DO data were low and erratic.  Data should be 
considered suspect.
05/26/01 14:00 - 05/31/01 23:30

Specific conductivity and pH data drifted downward during deployment dated 
05/09/0113:30 to 05/23/01 14:00.  Data near the end of this time period may be 
suspect, 
including DO in mg/l.  Drifting was probably caused by excessive fouling.  There 
was also an increase in turbidity during this same time period (see below 
comment).  Post deployment calibration check for both of these sensors was good.  
Data retained.

Specific conductivity displayed anomalous data at the following date and time.  
The specific conductivity values decreased and then increased by a relatively 
large amount in a short period of time.  Data were retained. 
05/26/01 15:30 - 17:30
05/23/01 14:00 - 14:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, June

DO data erratic and low during the following dates.  Sonde retrieved with a hole 
in DO membrane.  The following data were deleted.
06/01/01 00:00 - 06/06/01 10:30

Gradual declines in conductivity, DO, and pH can be seen during deployment, 
06/06/0112:00  - 06/19/01 19:00.  It did rain fairly regularly in June, 
especially from 13-
16 June.  Sensors were also probably becoming gradually fouled causing data to 
be suspect.  DO and pH sensors passed the post deployment calibration check.  
All data were retained.

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, July

DO data showed a great deal of noise during the following dates.  There was a 
toadfish and a blenny in the datalogger probe guard cup upon retrieval.  
However, 
the post deployment calibration check was good, so data were retained.
07/03/01 12:00 - 07/05/01 12:30 

The conductivity data appears to have drifted during the deployment from 
07/05/01 - 07/19/01.  Data should be considered suspect, including DO (mg/l) 
data.  Data were retained.

During the following period the DO data were deleted due to compromised probe 
membrane integrity.
07/21/01 19:00 - 07/31/01 23:30

During the deployment the pH bulb broke.  Data during the following period were 
deleted. 
07/22/01 00:00 - 07/31/01 23:30		

The conductivity and salinity data were deleted for the following dates.  The 
drop in data may have been caused by sediment covering the sensor.
07/24/01 12:00 - 07/30/01 17:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if an animal gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, August

During the following period the DO data were deleted due to a compromised probe 
membrane integrity.
08/01/01 00:00 - 08/02/01 14:30

During the deployment the pH bulb broke.  The following data were deleted.
08/01/01 00:00 - 08/02/01 14:30

Towards the end of deployment dated 08/02/01 - 08/16/01 DO readings appear noisy 
and unstable.  This may be due to fouling of or sediment covering the DO 
membrane.  Corresponds to high turbidity readings (see below). DO data were 
deleted.
08/14/01 21:30 - 08/16/01 15:00

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, September

Data from all the parameters were not recorded due to sonde exchange and 
deployment structure maintenance.
09/07/01 10:30
09/13/01 15:30-16:30

Conductivity readings drifted downward throughout the month after each 
deployment.  Consider the data on the following dates suspect, including DO 
(mg/l).
09/03/01 22:00 - 09/07/01 10:00
09/07/01 11:00 - 09/13/01 15:00

Conductivity and pH data showed downward drift in the following time periods.  
They were either both responding to a real event, or were covered by sediment.  
Turbidity data were exceedingly high during the same time period values (see 
turbidity comment below), corroborating the presence of sediment or other 
interfering object.  Data were retained, but should be considered suspect, 
including DO (mg/l).  Both conductivity and pH rebounded prior to datalogger 
retrieval.
09/13/01 17:00 - 09/30/01 13:30

Conductivity and pH data both make anomalous jumps up in value.  It's possible 
that whatever was causing the downward drift (see above comment) moved or 
changed.  All data were retained.
09/30/01 13:30-14:00

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

Research Creek, October

Data from all the parameters were not recorded due to sonde exchange.
10/16/01 12:00			

During the following dates the DO data were deleted due to a membrane puncture.
10/04/01 03:00 - 10/16/01 11:30

During the datalogger deployment dated 10/16/01 - 11/01/01, conductivity data 
drifted downward, possibly caused by sediment covering the sensor or fouling.  
Consider data suspect during the following dates.
10/18/01 01:00 - 10/31/01 23:30

During the following dates there was a drop in pH readings, most likely due to 
sediment accumulating on the sensor.  Data were retained.
10/19/01 15:30 - 10/21/01 12:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors range.  
The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions that 
occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is covered by 
sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

For the duration of the deployment dated 01/09/01 to 01/31/01, depth appeared to 
be off.  The sonde was probably shifted soon after deployment due to the strong 
currents in the area.  Data were retained.

For the following dates and times depth readings were negative. However, based 
on the other parameters measured, the sonde was not out of the water. All data 
were retained.

11) Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, and elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.


13) Notes:

High turbidity values above instruments top range (1000 NTU), caused by blockage 
of light transmittance by an obstruction are left in the file.

Whenever specific conductivity or salinity data (referred to as conductivity 
data) were suspect, consider DO data in mg/l suspect as well, since specific 
conductivity is used to calculate DO data in mg/l.

Start times of each sample were off by 52 seconds and were corrected to the hour 
and half hour for all of the deployments in 2001, except for data gathered 
during 04/16/01 - 05/11/01 at East Cribbing.

Negative or zero depth readings were not deleted because the salinity and DO 
readings indicated that the sonde was submerged during these periods.
