2. Entry verification:
Data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI and graphs are produced and examined 
using the PC 6000 software. Data are also uploaded in a comma-delimited format 
from the YSI to the PC. Edited files are created by removing headers, footers, 
and spaces on a PC in Excel 5.0. Suspect data are evaluated using QA/QC macros 
(version 3.0) from CDMO. Missing data from YSI maintenance are inserted into the 
spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.). Edited files are merged to create 
one full month of data. Edited and raw data are archived at Elkhorn Slough NERR. 
John Haskins is responsible for the editing and archiving of data.

3. Research objectives:
Non-point source pollution is among the highest research priorities within the 
Elkhorn Slough watershed. Agriculture and specifically strawberry production, is 
a significant land use in the watershed, with agricultural production making up 
one quarter of land use and strawberries comprising about 8% of the Elkhorn 
Slough watershed.  Agricultural runoff has led to high concentrations of 
nutrients and some pesticides in the Slough.  Several studies have shown that 
agricultural practices have an impact on the species composition and ecological 
processes in Elkhorn Slough.  Two sites within the Slough water are being 
monitored.  One site (SM) is in the Reserve at the edge of the channel next to a 
Salicornia marsh that is surrounded by a mixture of native and introduced 
grasses and shrubs in the uplands.  This is a relatively pristine location with 
minimal inputs of agricultural runoff.  Azevedo Pond (AP), the second site, is 
surrounded by strawberry fields with a very narrow (about 3 m) fringe of marsh.  
The farm surrounding the pond is part of a project to develop best management 
practices and new growing techniques. Measurements are taken every 30 minutes 
over a three to four week period at two sites in Elkhorn Slough.

4. Research methods: 
The Elkhorn Slough water monitoring program began in July 1995. Both sites 
described above are monitored simultaneously. Prior to YSI deployment at SM, a 
20 foot length of 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was placed in the slough to house the 
YSI. Holes were drilled in the pipe to remove 10% of the pipe's surface area and 
to allow waterflow across the YSI. The pipe was positioned vertically in the 
slough with one end pushed into the soft bottom sediments and the other end 
secured to shore. A bolt in the pipe maintains the YSI exactly one foot (30cm) 
above the bottom. Prior to YSI deployment at AP, a supportive framework of rope 
and PVC was placed at the site to house the YSI. The structure maintains the YSI 
exactly one foot (30cm) above the pond bottom. Every half-hour over a 30-day 
period, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature, depth, turbidity and pH are recorded. 30 day periods were chosen 
due to the limitations of the dissolved oxygen membrane and battery power. At 
the end of each 30 day period, the YSI is brought back into the lab for 
downloading, cleaning, and recalibration. Data is downloaded on PC and graphs 
are printed using the PC 6000 software.  Sonde body and probes are cleaned.  DO 
membrane is changed and allowed to re-equilibrate for at least one hour before 
calibration.  Calibration is as outlined in the user manual.  Buffer solutions 
of pH 7 and pH 10 are purchased from a scientific supply house and used for two 
point calibration.  A salinity standard of 31.892 ppt is also purchased and used 
for calibration. After approximately four hours of down time, the YSIs are 
redeployed for another 30 days. As of July 1998 a new YSI is calibrated in the 
lab in order to replace the previous one in the field. This eliminates the loss 
of data due to cleaning and calibration.
	At the September deployment at Azevedo Pond the housing was moved 
approximately 1 meter in a deeper part of the pond.  This helped to prevent YSI 
from coming out of water at extreme low tides.

5. Site location and character:
Elkhorn Slough is located on the West Coast of the United States in Central 
California. It connects with the Pacific Ocean in central Monterey Bay near Moss 
Landing, California. There are two sampling sites.  SM (South Marsh) 36? 49’N, 
121? 44’W is in a side channel of the slough and is relatively unimpacted by 
anthropogenic influences.  The YSI is located on the side of a bank in one of 
the secondary slough channels.  AP (Azevedo Pond) 36? 50’N, 121? 45’W is in a 
pond which receives fertilizer and pesticide runoff from a strawberry field in 
year-round production. The YSI is located about 10m from a culvert connecting 
the pond to the slough.

6. Data collection period:
Sampling at both sites began simultaneously on June 26, 1995 and data collection 
is ongoing. 

7. Associated researchers and projects:
The following are brief descriptions of research projects in Elkhorn Slough as 
of June 1998.
	Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Elkhorn Slough 
Foundation have had an ongoing program to monitor estuarine water quality in the 
central Monterey Bay region since 1988.  Currently, 24 stations are monitored 
monthly for temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, nitrate, 
ammonium and dissolved inorganic phosphate concentrations.  Two of these 
stations on the Reserve are about 400 m from the SM site.  Data collection began 
at these two stations in September 1989.  A monthly monitoring station is also 
located at Azevedo Pond within 10 m of the YSI deployment.  Monthly data from 
the Azevedo Pond are available from March 1992.
	The University of California Santa Cruz Agroecology Program has an ongoing 
project to examine the effects of agricultural production on an adjacent 
wetland.  Matthew Werner, Marc Los Huertos, Felecia Rein, Sean Swezey, Mark 
Silberstein, Andrew De Vogelaere, Ron Tjeerdema have been the principal 
investigators.  They have made a detailed baseline characterization of wetlands 
and an adjacent field under chemically-intensive strawberry production.  The 
Monterey Bay Regional Studies Program at UCSC awarded graduate fellowships to 
Marc Los Huertos and Felecia Rein to study the effects of native vegetation 
buffer zones on movement of sediment and agricultural run-off.  The overall 
goals of this program are to test alternative farming practices that can 
mitigate negative effects on wetlands while providing a sustainable livelihood 
for farmers.  This research is occurring on the Azevedo Ranch in a pond and 
pocket marsh adjacent to the AP YSI deployment site.Caitlin Bean. Small mammal

b) Between 23:30 Jan 13 and 00:30 Jan 14, and between 16:30 Jan 18 and 0100 Jan 
19 there were erratic high positive and high negative turbidity readings. Also on Jan 27 03:30 
turbidity was low. It is unclear if these data are obstructions, probe malfunctions, or out of water 
(OOW) events. See missing data to see which data were deleted.
