2. Entry verification:
	The data are uploaded in three file formats (each to separate files 
identified with the same file name but with unique extensions) from the YSI 6000 
(and 6600) data loggers to a PC with the YSI 6000 (and 6600) data transfer 
software (Kermit).  Two of these (PC6000 and ASCII text formats) are kept on 
file in the WBNERR archive.  The comma delimited format data file is imported to 
the EXCEL spreadsheet program (version 5.0), where it is processed according to 
standard NERRS CDMO protocol, using the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros.  File size of one 
complete month of data each has been achieved by concatenating (and truncating 
if necessary) shorter files of interrupted data segments.  File contents are 
examined for anomalies (e.g., sensor malfunction, battery failure, spurious 
values, etc.) by visualization of data with the Ecowatch Software provided by 
YSI.  Data requiring editing are noted and copies of the graphs of raw data are 
saved at WBNERR.  Data editing to CDMO protocol is conducted in EXCEL.  Missing 
data (data logger malfunction or maintenance periods) are represented by periods 
(".").  Outliers (data values not within the design range of the respective 
sensors except for turbidity and depth) are changed to periods.  Data values 
recorded during deployment or retrieval (i.e., when the instrument was out of 
the water or in the laboratory) are deleted or replaced with periods.  A record 
of changes is documented in the Data Anomalies section of the metadata file. The 
monthly files are sent electronically by FTP to CDMO.  Copies of all files are 
retained at the reserve. Dave Giehtbrock, the Research Assistant, normally 
performs all data management. However, for the period from October to December, 
when we had no RA, the Research Coordinator, Chris Weidman, carried out this 
task.  
   
3. Research Objectives:
	One primary issue of concern for the Waquoit Bay ecosystem is the 
influence of anthropogenic-induced alterations by nitrogen enrichment.  Waquoit 
Bay receives nitrogen from several sources, such as septic systems (their 
leachate percolates into groundwater which then enters the bay), run off from 
roads, run off containing domestic and agricultural fertilizer and animal waste, 
and atmospheric sources. This elevated nitrogen loading to the bay has resulted 
in eutrophic conditions that have contributed to alterations of habitats in the 
bay.  For example, thick mats of seaweed now cover the bottom where eelgrass 
meadows thrived in the 1970's.  Unfortunately, there are few definitive records 
of bay conditions during that period, which makes it difficult to evaluate the 
rates of change.  To facilitate future evaluation, long-term records from data 
loggers are being compiled to track several parameters that describe conditions 
in this eutrophic system.  Of particular interest are measurements of dissolved 
oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyll.  These long-term records will facilitate 
evaluation of changes which may come about from a continuation of watershed 
alteration that result from "traditional" development (i.e., non-sewered 
residential areas served by private septic systems typically consisting of 
septic tanks and leach fields) as well as non-industrial commercial development, 
such as golf courses, cranberry bogs, and retail shopping outlets.  The records 
will be useful for evaluating the efficacy of remediation efforts intended to 
reduce the nitrogen loading from these sources to Waquoit Bay.
	Another focus of long-term research interest is the detection of climate 
change and the determination of its effects on the estuarine environment.  
Characterizing the variability of the various water column parameters, such as 
its scale, magnitude and frequency, is likely to be a very important aspect of 
the estuarine ecosystem, that is also sensitive to climate change. Related to 
this focus is an interest in the impact of storms (hurricanes and northeasters) 
and other extreme meteorological events on the estuary. For example, what 
temperature and wind field thresholds exist that might bring about or trigger 
certain conditions within the bay?  The observations recorded by the data 
loggers will allow for these types of studies.      

4. Research methods:
	  This year instruments were almost continuously  operated at this site 
from late March through late December, when sea ice conditions became severe 
enough on 12/27/00 to cause us to abandon the site for the winter.  No data were 
collected at the reserve prior to late March due to ice conditions, and the 
related lack of boats available for deployment and retrieval, and also a lack of 
personnel.  Logger sensors were 0.75 m above the bottom to ensure they were 
above the dense macro algal mat that covers the bottom of Waquoit Bay. The YSI 
sondes measure and record ambient water temperature, specific conductivity (and 
calculate salinity), dissolved oxygen ( mg/L and % saturated), turbidity (NTU), 
water level (m), and pH at 30 minute intervals during deployment periods 
extending for approximately two weeks. 
	This year in the autumn we purchased a new YSI 6600 along with a YSI 
chlorophyll (6025) sensor. This gave us the potential capability of estimating 
chlorophyll biomass. We achieved our initial deployment of this instrument in 
early December and used the "chlorophyll" data to carry out a basic set of 
calibration experiments. Because of its preliminary nature, we have not included 
this data in this year's SWMP data set for CDMO, however this data is shown and 
discussed in our Chlorophyll Sensor Report to NERRs (1/2001).     
	Sonde deployment was achieved two different ways this year. The first 
method, and the one used in previous years, is characterized by a mooring set up 
that consists of  a 75 pound anchor (cinder blocks) to which two lines are 
attached. One line is for a surface float that marks the location. The other is 
shorter and terminates at a smaller float; line length is such that the float 
remains submerged throughout tidal changes. The data logger is attached to this 
line in a vertical manner so that the sensors (pointing downward) are suspended 
75 cm from the bottom. This system was chosen in past because local regulations 
prohibited the installation of a more permanent structure that extended above 
water (e.g., a piling) and to minimize opportunities for vandalism. However, in 
mid-summer we designed, built and deployed a new mooring system that consisted 
of a PVC pipe tower, about 1.5 meters in height) extending from a 120 lb cast 
concrete base that was deployed on the bottom at the site. A larger diameter 
(5") PVC section, that is also adjustable (though for our current purposes set 
at .75 m off the bottom) , is attached to this tower and is topped with a larger 
funnel shaped piece, that allows the YSI instrument to be lowered and easily 
inserted into the 5" PVC section from the surface. The lower part of the PVC 
section is exposed to allow the YSI sonde's sensors direct exposure to ambient 
waters. This latter set up allows for faster and more convenient deployment / 
retrieval while being much less vulnerable to severe wave conditions during 
storms since it is basically independent of any surface floatation, except for 
site marking. Similarly, it is even less vulnerable to boating traffic and 
vandalism than our previous method.     
	During colder months, continuous operations are limited to about two weeks 
due to limited battery life. In the warmer months, particularly June - 
September, bio-fouling of the sensors also limits continuous operation to about 
two weeks even though battery performance during this period would allow for 
longer deployments.  
	After a deployment, each logger is brought back to the laboratory for post 
calibration check, data downloading, instrument and sensor cleaning, and 
calibration. These procedures are carried out according to the methods described 
in the YSI Operating Manual.  Salinity sensors were calibrated with reference 
seawater that had been previously analyzed with a Guildline salinometer at the 
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  pH sensors were calibrated with 7.0 
and 10.0 pH standard solutions (2-point calibrations). The turbidity standard 
solutions were prepared from formazin dilutions to 100 NTU. Temperature sensors 
were not calibrated.  Oxygen sensor membranes were inspected before and after 
each deployment.  Oxygen sensor membranes were replaced 24 hours prior to each 
deployment per recommendation by YSI personnel. Final DO calibration was not 
done until the membrane had been in place for at least 24 hours. Performance was 
also evaluated during the post-retrieval check in the laboratory test tank prior 
to post-calibration.  
   

5. Site location and character:

	In 1998, it was determined that the Metoxit Point site was likely to be a 
more representative location for sampling of the bay's water quality conditions 
than the previous SWMP site referred to as the Central Basin site, and so the 
Metoxit Point is now the primary SWMP site for Waquoit Bay, and the Central 
Basin site has since been discontinued. A more in depth discussion of the 
reasons for this decision can be found in the 1998 and 1999 Metadata for 
Waquoit Bay.  Note that this site is a change in location from the original 
"base line" . This site has the coordinates, 41o  34.131' N 070o 31.294' W, and 
was given the designation of MP.  The site is well flushed by tides, is 1.8-2.5 
m deep, and is in an area that is minimally disturbed by routine activities on 
the bay (e.g. boat traffic, shell fishing, etc.).
	The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (WBNERR) is located in 
the northeastern United States on the southern shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  
About 8,000 people maintain permanent residency in Waquoit Bay's drainage area, 
which covers parts of the towns of Falmouth, Mashpee, and Sandwich.  During 
summer months, the population swells 2-3 fold.
   	WBNERR is representative of shallow coastal lagoons that occur from Cape 
Cod to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. WBNERR is within the Virginian biogeographic 
province, on the transitional border (Cape Cod) between the Virginian and the 
more northern Acadian biogeographic province.
	Like many embayments located on glacial outwash plains, Waquoit Bay is 
shallow, fronted by prominent barrier beaches (i.e., those of South Cape Beach 
State Park and Washburn Island), and is backed by salt marshes and upland 
forests.  Two narrow, navigable inlets, reinforced with granite jetties, pass 
through two barrier beaches to connect Waquoit Bay with Nantucket Sound 
to the south.  A third shallow and generally unnavigable inlet opened through 
the Washburn Island barrier beach during Hurricane Bob in August 1991, and has 
migrated westward since. As early as 2001, it appears to be rapidly infilling 
with sediments and may close within the next year. 
   	Dense housing developments cover the two peninsulas that form the western 
shore of the Waquoit Bay estuarine system.  Although the developments themselves 
are outside of the Reserve boundaries, nitrogen in the discharges from their 
septic systems (which flows ultimately into the bay via groundwater) and in the 
fertilizer run-off from their lawns has significant effects on the functioning 
of the Waquoit Bay ecosystem. The impacts of these effects have been a primary 
subject of study at the Reserve since its designation (1988).  An outcome of 
this research has been the delineation of subwatersheds within the overall 
drainage area for Waquoit Bay, of which WBNERR is a small part. This knowledge 
allows for the design of experiments based on the spatial variation of nutrient 
loading and its impacts.
	At the northern end of the Bay, an area comprising a separate 
subwatershed, coastal bluffs of glacial till rise 30 feet above sea level, the 
highest land within the Reserve.  Adjacent to the bluffs, the northern basin of 
the bay is its deepest area (3 m mean low water), albeit much of the 
remainder of the bay is only slightly shallower (roughly 1.6 m). Bourne, Bog, 
and Caleb ponds are freshwater kettle hole ponds on the northern-most shore of 
the bay.  As components of the same sub-watershed, they have a common albeit 
minor freshwater outflow into the bay's northern basin via a narrow channel 
through a brackish marsh.  Although this flow is small, over the centuries it 
has created a significant delta of coarse sand that overlies much finer 
sediments found at comparable offshore distances elsewhere. The source of this 
sand is the sandy beach through which this fresh water discharge must travel.   
	To the east and south, other subwatersheds surround several salt and 
freshwater ponds, including Hamblin and Jehu Ponds, brackish salt ponds that are 
connected to the Bay by the tidal waters of Little and Great rivers, 
respectively.  The shorelines of the ponds are developed with residences that 
are occupied both seasonally and year round. Hamblin Pond and Little River are 
components of one subwatershed, and Jehu Pond and Great River are elements of a 
separate subwatershed. Further south lies Sage Lot Pond. It is in the least 
developed subwatershed which also contains the barrier beach and salt marsh 
ecosystem of the reserve's South Cape Beach State Park. To the east of Sage Lot 
Pond and within the same subwatershed, lies the highly brackish Flat Pond. It 
receives minimal tidal flows of salt water from Sage Lot Pond through a narrow, 
excavated channel. The preponderance of the input to Flat Pond is groundwater 
and run off, both of which are likely affected (e.g., nutrients, pesticides, 
bacteria) by an adjacent golf course and near-by upper-scale residential 
development.
	The largest source of freshwater to Waquoit Bay is the Quashnet / Moonakis 
River.  (Although named "river", this and the reserve's Childs River are more 
appropriately described as "rivulets" because of their small channels and 
discharge ~1.0 CFS).  A component of yet another subwatershed, it originates in 
Johns Pond situated north of the bay and traverses forests, cranberry bogs, 
residential areas, and the Quashnet Valley Golf Course before entering the bay 
near the southern "boundary" of the northern basin. ("Quashnet" applies to that 
portion of the river within the town of Mashpee, and "Moonakis" refers to the 
brackish estuary at the river's mouth, lying in the town of Falmouth.  Quashnet 
will be used hereafter to refer to the entire river.)  The Quashnet River is the 
only component of the Waquoit Bay estuary system that has sufficient numbers of 
coliform bacteria to cause it to be closed to shell fishing. The source(s) of 
this bacteria is unknown. The Quashnet River delivers significantly less 
nitrogen to Waquoit Bay than does the Childs River, which lies to the west and 
originates in Johns Pond.
 	The Childs River is the second largest input of freshwater to the bay.  A 
component of another subwatershed, it runs through densely developed residential 
areas. The Childs River subwatershed receives the highest nitrogen loading and 
is the largest nitrogen contributor to the Waquoit Bay system of all the 
subwatersheds.
	Another, albeit smaller, source of freshwater is the discharge of Red 
Brook through brackish marshlands into Hamblin Pond.  Additional freshwater 
enters the bay elsewhere through groundwater seepage, precipitation and the 
flows of small brooks.  A significant groundwater flow enters the eastern end of 
the mooring basin at the head of the bay. There is relatively little 
surface water runoff entering directly into the bay due to the high percolation 
rates of Cape Cod's coarse, sandy soils.
	Knowledge of the degree of mixing in Waquoit Bay was originally derived 
from measurements made by reserve staff and from data obtained by the reserve's 
volunteer water quality monitoring group, the Waquoit Bay Watchers who have 
collected depth profiles of Waquoit Bay water quality since 1993. Subsequent 
research by reserve staff has revealed that lateral mixing has considerable 
influence because tidal currents follow a general course through the bay. This 
results in an overall structure to horizontal patterns of water quality 
characteristics. 
The pattern it produces is a gyre in the central portion of the bay whereby 
currents follow a circular pattern in an anticlockwise direction around a 
central area that exhibits reduced exchange with the remainder of the bay. The 
flushing rate within the gyre is diminished when compared with other areas of 
the bay. The location of the gyre meanders slightly, apparently under the 
influence of tides and wind.  The MP site is more consistently near the outer 
regions of the gyre, that is, more frequently in the circular current, and those 
data should be less affected by the meandering of the gyre. (Relocating the 
logger to the central area of the gyre is impractical because that area 
if frequented by boat traffic and the logger mooring would be a hazard to 
navigation.) 
	Tides in Waquoit Bay are semidiurnal with an average range of about 0.4 m. 
Largely because of the shallow conditions, restricted tidal inlet, and low 
amplitude tidal signal, tides in the bay are also influenced by wind forcing. 
Salinity in Waquoit Bay ranges from 28 to 31 ppt. At the sampling site, the 
depth is about 2 m (MHW). Monitoring probes are positioned about 0.75 m above 
the bottom. Bottom sediments are organic rich silts and medium sands. Thick (up 
to 0.3m) macroalgae (Seaweed) mats overlie much of the bottom of the bay, and 
largely consist of species Cladophora vagabunda, Gracilaria tikvahiayae, and 
Enteromorpha. The dominant marsh vegetation near the sampling site are Spartina 
alterniflora and Spartina patens. Dominant upland vegetation includes mixed 
forests of red oak, white oak, and pitch pine, and other shrubs and plants 
common to coastal New England. Land-use in the bays watershed is about 60% 
natural vegetation, but the remaining land is largely residential, with some 
commercial (retail malls), and minor amounts of agriculture (~3%) (cranberry 
bogs). The activities which most impact the site are 1) enhanced nitrogen loads 
derived from individual residential septic systems, and 2) intensive 
recreational boating during the summer months.

11. Missing Data
Data Loggers were not operated until March 30, 2000.

March 2000:
	MP: No data collected until March 30 10:30.
April 2000:
	MP: 04/27 12:00 Data missing due to probe out of the water for calibration 
and redeployment 
of another sonde.

May 2000:
	MP: A post calibration check and graphical review of the data collected 
5/22/00 14:00 until 6/8/00 9:30 revealed a catastrophic failure of the Dissolved 
Oxygen Probe starting at 5/26/00 11:30.  All dissolved oxygen data from 5/26/00 
11:30 to 5/31/00 23:30 were deleted and replaced with periods.

5/22/00 14:00 until 6/8/00 9:30 revealed a catastrophic failure of the Dissolved 
Oxygen Probe starting at 5/26/00 11:30.  All dissolved oxygen data from 6/01/00 
00:00 to 6/8/00 9:30 were deleted and replaced with periods.

July 2000:
	MP: A post calibration check and graphical review of the data collected 
07/20/00 12:30 until 08/04/00 08:30 revealed a catastrophic failure of the 
Dissolved Oxygen Probe starting at 07/27/00 14:30.  
All dissolved oxygen data from 07/27/00 14:30 to 07/31/00 23:30 were deleted and 
replaced with periods.

August 2000:
	MP: 08/01/ 0:00 to 08/04 08:30 DO data was deleted due to diagnosed 
failure of DO membrane during this deployment period.
	MP: 08/06 21:30 to 08/17 09:00 Data missing due to power failure. 
Servicing of the battery contacts solved the problem. 
	MP: 08/30 17:30 to 08/31 23:30 DO data were deleted due to catastrophic 
failure of the dissolved oxygen probe starting at 08/30/00 17:30. 

September 2000:
	MP: 09/01 00:00 to 09/01 14:00 DO data were replaced with periods due to a 
catastrophic failure of the dissolved oxygen probe starting at 08/30 17:30.
	MP: 09/03 06:30 to 09/13 09:30 DO data were replaced with periods due to a 
catastrophic failure of the dissolved oxygen probe starting at 09/03 06:30.
	MP: 09/19 05:30 to 09/27 09:00 DO data were replaced with periods due to a 
catastrophic failure of the dissolved oxygen probe starting at 09/19 05:30.


October 2000
	MP: 10/10 12:00 to 10/11 09:30 Data missing because no data logger was 
deployed for this 
period.

November 2000
	MP: 11/18 11:30 One half hour data interval missing owing to retrieval / 
deployment overlap 
of sampling time - no logger in water precisely at sampling time. 
 
December 2000
	MP: 12/2 11:00- 12/16 8:00 No DO concentration data (mg/L) because 6600 
instrument was 
used for this deployment period and no concentration data were recorded. 
	MP: 12/27 9:30 to 12/31 23:30 No data because instruments deployments were 
stopped at this 
site for winter because of increasingly severe ice conditions (ice 3" thick on 
bay as of 12/27).
