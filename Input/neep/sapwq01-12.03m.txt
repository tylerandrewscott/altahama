2. Entry Verification:

	The data are reviewed using the YSI computer program EcoWatch included with 
the YSI 6000/6600 data logger.  After the file is uploaded from the data logger, 
EcoWatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical analyses (i.e., 
min., max., mean, std. dev.) The information obtained from this is used during 
file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the data logger 
was removed from the water or those caused by instrument failure.  The data are 
imported into a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's 
cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of data has been recorded the file 
is ready for review.  The data review includes several steps.  The first step is 
to format the data using the Excel macros provided by CDMO. The CDMO macros will 
allow the user to automatically format column widths to the correct number of 
decimal places based on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to 
QA/QC each data logger generated file for missing data points, fill all cells 
that do not contain data with periods, and find all data points that fall 
outside the range of what the data logger is designed to measure (i.e. 
outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users with 30-minute data to 
automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert 
periods for missing data.  In addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability 
was added to this macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing 
data point graphs on a monthly basis.  Secondly, the Excel macro is used to 
determine if there are any dates and times that data was not recorded due to 
maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  Missing dates and times are 
inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where data would 
normally be. Periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left 
blank. The reason for the missing data are recorded in this metadata 
document. 

	Data that was outside the "normal" range of water quality for a particular 
site is investigated for validity based on weather data, field observations, QC 
checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  If the data are 
rejected from the file a period is inserted to the cell(s) and an explanation 
for the missing dates and times are recorded in the metadata document. The 
completed metadata form is then submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Jane 
Garbisch was responsible for all 2003 data collection and management.  

	Upon submission to the CDMO, periods were removed for data dissemination 
purposes and left blank.  


3. Research Objectives:
Hydrological studies (Ragotskie and Bryson, 1955: Imberger et al., 1983) have 
shown that there are three tidal excursions along the length of the Duplin 
River, resulting in three distinct water masses.  The two monitoring sites in 
the Duplin River, called the Lower Duplin site and the Hunt Dock site, are 
located within the lower and upper water masses, respectively.  Water 
passing the Lower Duplin site during flood tide has come from Doboy Sound, which 
receives input from the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway and from 
the Atlantic Ocean.  The water in the lower water mass is pushed further up the 
Duplin or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh surface by 
the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb tide.  The water in 
the upper water mass, which passes the Hunt Camp station, is pushed up small 
creek channels and onto the marsh at each high tide.  Thus the two stations 
monitor conditions in two hydrological separate water masses, one of which is 
heavily influenced by exchanges with Doboy Sound and the other which is 
influenced by its twice-daily contact with the marsh surface.  
	
Sapelo Island is only accessible by passenger ferry.  Due to its 
isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the SAP NERR show relatively 
little evidence of human impact.  Thus the Marsh Landing dock, where the Lower 
Duplin site is located, the primary access point for the approximately 200-300 
residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off loading was chosen as the 
most directly impacted site.  The Lower Duplin site is also readily accessible 
and centrally located within the SAP NERR.  The University of Georgia Marine 
Institute has used this as a monitoring site for years and SAP NERR continues to 
do so.  The Hunt Dock site was selected in July 1999 for monitoring.  It is a 
dock only used for transporting hunters during the fall season.  It is further 
up the Duplin, where the primary usage of the river is for pleasure boating and 
crabbing.  Therefore it is considered the least impacted site.  The University 
of Georgia-Athens continues to monitor further up the Duplin and the Flume Dock 
site. The Flume Dock site is further up the river on the other side of Moses 
Hammock.  It has the same site characteristics of the Hunt dock site and has 
been a monitoring site for many years.  The SAP NERR has assumed the 
responsibility of this site to maintain a continuous data set that spans many 
years.


4.   Research Methods:

	The SAP NERR Water Quality Monitoring began in October of 1999, at the 
Marsh Landing Dock on the lower Duplin River.  At that time we were only 
performing long term water quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.  
Prior to April 15, 1999 the University of Georgia-Athens Marine Institute 
(UGAMI) completed sampling. When SAP NERR took over the NERR monitoring from the 
University of GA, a second site was set up at the Marsh Landing site to be the 
NERR monitoring station.  In order to lesson the confusion between the 2 sites, 
the SAP NERR site is referred to as the Lower Duplin site (LD) and is monitored 
at a fixed depth from the bottom (0.5m).  In June 2002, the reserve returned to 
including the University's monitoring sites. These sites are at a fixed depth 
just below the surface.  The sites include the Marsh Landing site, (ML) and the 
Flume Dock (FD). They are both hung by stainless steel chains from floating 
docks at a fixed depth, approximately 1.5 m. The Hunt Dock (HD) site is just 
south of the Flume Dock site and also measures at 0.5m above the surface bottom. 
Because the ML and FD sites are surface deployments the amount of fouling is 
much worse when compared to the LD and HD sites.  In an effort to improve the 
data, the YSI EDS sondes are used exclusively at these sites and the 6000 series 
and 6600 series sondes are used at the LD and HD sites.  The EDS sondes reduce 
some of the fouling, but there is still considerable deterioration of probe 
sensitivity during deployment. 

	Before each YSI PC6000 data logger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Calibration 
standards are only required for pH, conductivity, and turbidity, all other 
parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 2-point 
calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased from a scientific supply house.  The 
conductivity standard is made using a 0.2 M solution of KCl (24.82mS/cm = 14.92 
g/L) or from serial dilution of a certified conductivity standard.  The 
turbidity calibration uses distilled water made by the University of Georgia-
Athens Marine Institute and a purchased 100 NTU certified standard.  The 
dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit 
at least 24 hours prior to deployment.  Calibration is then verified by running 
a standard as a sample after each calibration. 

	When deployed, the weather conditions and tidal stage are recorded in the 
field observation log. The data logger is placed inside a length of PVC pipe 
attached to the dock.  The Lower Duplin data logger is attached to the north 
side of a non-floating dock by a steel cable and run down a PVC pipe to rest 
0.5m above the surface bottom.  The Hunt Dock data logger is attached to the 
south side of a fixed dock by steel cable and run down a PVC pipe to take 
measurements 0.5m above the surface bottom. Because of the large tidal range, 
water is continually flushed through the PVC pipes, thus eliminating the problem 
of creating a stagnate column of water with in the pipe with data logger. Every 
30 minutes during the sampling period measurements are taken for temperature, 
specific conductance, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, percent 
saturation, depth and turbidity.
	 
	At the end of the sample period the data logger is retrieved and 
immediately replaced by another calibrated data logger.  The data logger is then 
taken to the lab and runs QA/QC standards for pH, and conductivity, and 
dissolved oxygen, the data are uploaded, and the sonde is cleaned.  data are 
removed if the post calibration standards fail or if technical problems are 
noted.  All data removed is noted in the metadata.


5.  Site Location and character:
	
	Both the Marsh Landing (ML) and Lower Duplin (LD) monitoring sites (31 deg 
25' 4" N, 81 deg 17' 46" W) are located on the Marsh Landing Dock in the Duplin 
River on Sapelo Island and consists of a bottom muddy habitat.  Water passing 
the dock during flood tide originates from the Doboy Sound.  The Doboy receives 
input from the Atlantic Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal 
Waterway. The water is pushed up the river or up smaller tidal creeks and some 
is pushed onto the marsh surface by the flood tide and recedes into the main 
channel during ebb tide. The Marsh Landing dock is used as the main dock to the 
island where the ferry makes several daily runs, with several small boats that 
are docked there.  The surrounding area vegetation is dominated by salt marsh 
with Spartina being the predominate flora. Tidal range maximum for both sampling 
sites is 14 feet and the salinity range is 5-35 ppt. The depth at these sampling 
stations ranges from 1.5 meters to 6.0 meters depending on tide. 

	The Hunt Dock monitoring site (31 deg 28' 43", 81 deg 16' 23" W) is 
located on the Duplin River, off of Moses Hammock, which is separated by Sapelo 
Island by a small tidal channel.  The primary runoff at the site is from tidal 
creeks flowing through Spartina marsh and through the mud.  Bottom habitat at 
this site includes soft mud and some oyster bed building along the shoreline 
with a tidal range maximum of 14 feet and a salinity range of 5-35 ppt. There is 
little human traffic this far up the Duplin and it is north of the people living 
on Sapelo. During the fall, the Hunt dock and Moses Hammock are the camping and 
docking site for deer hunters traveling to the island.  These are controlled 
hunts and dates are available from the SAP NERR office if needed.  The Flume 
Dock site is located further up the Duplin River, around Moses Hammock. Maximum 
tidal range is 14 feet and salinity ranges 5-35 ppt. The maximum depth at the 
Hunt Dock site is 4.27 meters.  

	The Flume Dock site (31 deg 28' 58" N, 81 deg 16' 3" W) has a sonde 
connected to a floating dock.  They hang by stainless steel chain at a fixed 
depth approximately one meter below the surface of the water. Bottom habitat at 
this site includes soft mud and some oyster bed building along the shoreline.  
These sites were used since 1986 by the UGA Marine Institute. In June of 2002, 
the data collection was consolidated by the SAP NERR and the University.  
Because of the fixed placement of the sondes at the water surface the fouling of 
the probes is a continuous problem. The data will reflect this problem. Maximum 
tidal range is 14 feet and salinity ranges 5-35 ppt. The maximum depth at the 
Flume Dock site is 4.27 meters.  


	There are no current studies on pollutants in this area. Sapelo Island is 
typically considered a pristine environment, with the only pollutants nearby 
being contributed by the ferry dock and ferry parking lot.

8.  Associated researchers and projects:

Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the 
University of Georgia Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the island became 
a working laboratory for many.  The research continues today with SAP NERR and 
UGAMI creating a unique partnership with much of the current research being done 
facilitated by SAP NERR and UGAMI together.  Given UGAMI's long history on 
Sapelo, a bibliographic list of over 800 articles of current and previous 
research can be found on the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/ugami).

Due to the nature of the site's deployment heavy fouling occurs, 
often causing a steady deterioration of the data.  Some of the data are removed 
and some retained.  It is exceedingly difficult to determine the point to remove 
the data and is often a subjective decision.

September
9/1/03 00:00 – 15:30 Data towards the end of the deployment may be compromised 
due to sonde being covered with sea squirts at time of retrieval. Data retained 
but suspect. 
Deployment 9/18/03 11:00 – 10/15/03 15:30. Dissolved Oxygen data suspect due to 
fouling. Post deployment calibration readings low (30%). Could possibly be due 
to Hurricane Isabel just north of coast, which caused an increase in surf and 
light wind. Data retained.

Marsh Landing
Due to the nature of the site's deployment, heavy fouling occurs, often causing 
a steady deterioration of the data.  Some of the data are removed and some 
retained.  It is exceedingly difficult to determine the point to remove the data 
and is often a subjective decision.

12. Missing Data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other remarks:
Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.  

If the sonde was exposed at low tide, the data was retained.  It will be self 
evident that the sonde was exposed at low tide by looking at salinity values and 
depth.
