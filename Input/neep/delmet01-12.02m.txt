2) Entry verification 

a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded from 
each instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The 
CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr303.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the 
sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the 
data collection schedule).  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied 
by Campbell Scientific.  

This software was located on a computer to which the data was uploaded (every 15 
minutes) via a short haul modem to a computer located at St. Jones Center for Estuarine 
Studies.  The data was saved as a raw data file (SJ_RAW.dat) onto a separate hard drive 
and backed up onto Delaware Coastal Programs' (DCP) server.  


Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was 
developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of 
the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and Access Database.  
There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited 
monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a 
predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces 
error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are noted below in 
Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were performed are noted in the Data 
Correction section below.  

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s 
criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15 minute period, and precipitation 
difference of greater than 5mm in 15 minutes.  All errors of these types were double 
checked with other data that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted in 
the sections that follow. Wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria are common between 1900 
and 0600 hours and are not individually checked. Both raw data files and Access databases 
were saved to the DCP server with daily tape back-up. Both Robert Scarborough and Mike 
Mensinger conducted data management and QA/QC activities.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for the St. Jones 
Estuary in order to observe any environmental changes or trends over time. The data is 
also used for specific research studies relating to migrating shorebirds, horseshoe crab 
spawning, atmospheric deposition of nutrients and pesticides.


4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly and 
daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric 
pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken 
every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150.   The CR10X datalogger can store 
over three weeks of data before it overwrites the data, in addition there is a storage 
module that stores in excess of a month's data for backup. The data is sent every 15 
minutes to a computer for real-time display and storage. If the short haul modem link 
failed and data could not be automatically sent from the datalogger to the computer the 
data would be downloaded from the CR10X to a laptop computer following procedures in Part 
D. Section 4.5 of the CDMO Operations Manual.  Periodically, sensors on the 
weatherstation are inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired 
and/or cleaned.  Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration 
at minimum of every year. 

5) Site location and character:

The Delaware National Estuarine Research Reserve is comprised of two component sites, the 
St. Jones River and Blackbird Creek components.  Both components are located along the 
Delaware Bay Coast.   The St. Jones River Component is located in central Kent County 
Delaware, east of the State capitol city, Dover.  The Blackbird Creek component is 
located in the unincorporated area of Southern New Castle County.  The meteorological 
station site, is located in the St. Jones DNERR component. It is located in a tidal marsh 
area with a wooded fringe area 100 m to the north, 75 m to east, 75 m to the west and 1+ 
km to south. The wooded area is of an approximate average height of 16 m.

             Position:    Latitude   39 degree 05' 20.05" N
                          Longitude  75 degree 26' 12.78" W

The unit is mounted on a 3-meter tower adjacent to the boardwalk that crosses the marsh. 
The elevations above the marsh surface are as follows; Barometric pressure - 2.2 m, 
temperature and relative humidity - 2.9 m , wind and PAR - 4.5 m, highest point on tower 
(lightning rod) - 4.9 m. The rain gauge is 2.4 m above the surface and 3 m south of the 
tower. The adjacent boardwalk is 1.1 m above the surface with a railing height of 1.0 m. 
A vegetative cover of spartina surrounds the area with an average height of 1 m. The 
tower and rain gauge are both 1 m east of the boardwalk. The weatherstation is located 
approximately 2 km from the water quality datasonde at Scotton Landing.


6) Data collection period:

The meteorological monitoring program was started in October 1997 at the DNERR and has 
been continuous through the present. The data collection format has followed NERRS 
protocol since standardized meteorological program development in November of 1998.

CDMO home page http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu.  Data are available in text format and 
Access data tables.

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project also has three stations located at the DNERR.  
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data for St. 
Jones and Blackbird watersheds in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality over time.  The five sites represent a pristine site and the other four 
represent impacted sites.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over roughly two-week 
collecting periods. 

In addition atmospheric deposition of rainfall events is performed in the DNERR 
watersheds to monitor and characterize the nutrient input to the estuary from differing 
storm events and seasonally. Three samplers are positioned across the St. Jones watershed 
and one is in the Blackbird watershed.

101	19	353	1100	Missing 101 ARRAY (Hourly Averages)
102	19	353	1100	Missing 102 Array (Hourly Average Wind Parameters)


13) Other Remarks/notes


The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
