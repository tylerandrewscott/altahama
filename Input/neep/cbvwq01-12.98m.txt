2. Entry verification
The data were uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 data loggers and reviewed 
using PC6000 software from YSI.  Graphs were produced and examined using the 
PC6000 software then printed out and filed in order to aid in reviewing data to 
correlate any anomalous and outlying data.  Next, files were uploaded in comma 
delimited format which were opened in Excel 5.0 software and edited to remove 
extraneous information (headers, footers, spaces, and pre- and post-deployment 
data).  Monthly templates were used to form complete sets of monthly data sets.  
Macros supplied by NERRS/CDMO were used to help with editing, formatting and 
identifying outliers in the database.  Suspect data (as in data believed to 
result from a damaged or biofouled probe) were evaluated according to Appendix B 
of the CDMO manual, edited and documented. Missing data due to YSI maintenance 
(down time) was inserted into the spreadsheet and was denoted by periods (.).  
Data that was not within calibration range of the instrument were evaluated and 
removed from the record and denoted by periods (.).  Edited and raw data files 
were copied and archived in the CBNERRVA file server and uploaded to the CDMO 
FTP site.  All Taskinas Creek and Goodwin Islands files from 1998 have been 
verified using the latest update of the Microsoft Excel 5.0 macro programs which 
formatted the data, verified dates and times and identified outliers (values 
that fall outside of the calibration - see section II.8 of this document) and 
other erroneous data.  Outliers were determined according to the instruments' 
manufacturers manual.  Tammy Dorman collected and edited data from 01/98 to 
04/98.  Eric Wooden edited the data from 4/98 to 12/98.  Tammy Dorman and Eric 
Wooden processed the data through the latest update of the CDMO macro and Eric 
Wooden conducted final editing of the data.  Following final editing, Eric 
Wooden uploaded the database to the CBNERRVA server and to CDMO.  

3. Research Objectives
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative of an inner coastal plain rural 
watershed within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This watershed is 
dominated by forested and agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land 
use component.  The drainage basin is suited for investigating hydrologic and 
nonpoint source water quality issues associated with changing land use patterns; 
these issues are of prime importance to the U.S. EPA Chesapeake Bay Program.  
Continuously monitored physical water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, 
specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) provide long-term measurements 
which can be supplemented with shorter-term monitoring and process oriented 
studies.  Measurements were taken every 15 minutes at the Taskinas Creek site 
and the YSI dataloggers were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at 
two-week intervals, except during the summer when the instruments were 
calibrated weekly.   

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Goodwin Islands represent marsh islands surrounded by intertidal flats, 
submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds, oyster reefs, and shallow open 
estuarine waters.  Because minimal human activities occur within upland 
portions, the Goodwin Islands are suitable as a reference or control site for 
nonpoint source water quality issues.  Furthermore, due to extensive wetlands, 
intertidal, and submerged habitats, the Goodwin Islands are used extensively for 
SAV, material flux, and trophic interaction research activities.  Measurements 
were taken every 15 minutes at the Goodwin Islands site and the YSI dataloggers 
were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at two-week intervals, 
except during the summer when the instruments were calibrated weekly. 

4.  Research methods 
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a long-term water quality-
monitoring program, which consists of two stations.  The Taskinas Creek station 
is located in the transitional zone of the York River tributary in the York 
River State Park.  A simple deployment was arranged with the State Park in 
September 1995, where the secured unit hung at a fixed depth (0.5 m above the 
creek bed) from an overhanging tree approximately six meters upstream from the 
parks canoe landing.  In September 1997, the deployment was modified so that the 
datalogger remained secure at all times within a 4-inch PVC housing 0.5 m above 
the bottom.  Three wood pilings were driven into the sediment in an equilateral 
triangle arrangement and the PVC pipe bolted to one piling.  Specific 
conductivity, pH, depth, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity are 
recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity and DO saturation are determined from 
temperature and specific conductivity readings.  At approximately two-week 
intervals, the data logger is returned to the lab for downloading, cleaning, 
membrane replacement and recalibration, except during the summer when the 
instruments were calibrated weekly.   Maintenance intervals are determined 
according to the amount of biofouling that occurs and to accommodate battery 
life.  A second YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed following retrieval of the 
original YSI datasonde in order to maintain a continuous record.  All procedures 
are in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, sections 3 and 7.  
Standards for pH, and conductivity were purchased from YSI.  Turbidity standards 
were purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems.  Data are reviewed and edited 
according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the CDMO 
manual.  

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component:
The Chesapeake Bay NERRS of Virginia maintains a second long-term water quality-
monitoring program at Goodwin Islands, located at the mouth of the York River.  
This station is located on the southeastern side of the main island in a shallow 
embayment, approximately 400 meters from shore.  A stable and permanent 
structure was built in October 1997 where 4-inch PVC pipe is housed inside of a 
commercially available galvanized steel communications tower with the datalogger 
0.5 m from the bottom.  Specific conductivity, pH, depth, dissolved oxygen, 
temperature, and turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity and DO 
saturation are determined from temperature and specific conductivity readings.  
At approximately two-week intervals, the datalogger is returned to the lab for 
downloading, cleaning, membrane replacement and recalibration.  Maintenance 
intervals are determined according to the amount of biofouling that occurs and 
to accommodate battery life.  A second YSI 6000 datalogger is deployed following 
retrieval of the original YSI datasonde in order to maintain a continuous 
record.  All procedures are in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods, 
sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH, and conductivity were purchased from YSI.  
Turbidity standards were purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems.  Data are 
reviewed and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in 
Appendix B of the CDMO manual.

5.  Site location and character
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component: (37 deg 24' 54.04617"; 76 deg 42' 51.75733"). 
The Taskinas Creek Component of the CBNERR-VA is on the south shore of 
the York River in James City County near Williamsburg.  The site is 
approximately 44 kilometers upstream from the river's mouth and 15 kilometers 
downstream from West Point.  Headwaters of Taskinas Creek are near the town of 
Croaker, which is located 10 kilometers north of Williamsburg.  Fed by numerous 
perennial streams, Taskinas Creek is approximately 3 kilometers in length and 
flows in a northeasterly direction eventually emptying into the York River.  
Tidal range within the creek is 0.0-1.3 m. The salinity range for Taskinas Creek  
.7-20 ppt.  The sampling station is located on the second bend from the mouth of 
Taskinas Creek within the York River State Park, about 6 meters upstream from 
the park's canoe landing.  The sediment type at this station consists of 
approximately 42% fine sand, 30% clay, and 28% silt.  The non-tidal portion 
contains feeder streams, which drain oak-hickory forests, maple-gum-oak-ash 
swamps and freshwater marshes.  The marshes near the creek mouth are brackish 
with a salinity range from 3-13 ppt.  The shoreline is moderately low with 
fringing marsh and tidal flats.  Taskinas Creek mainly drains the undeveloped 
York River State Park watershed, however the watershed is lightly impacted above 
the State Park by residential development and selective hardwood logging.  
Wildlife populations have been shown to influence microbiological water quality 
within the watershed.

Goodwin Islands (GI) Component: (37 deg 13' 02.65093"; 76 deg 23' 32.75799").  The 
Goodwin Islands component of the CBNERR-VA is on the mouth of the York River at 
the northeastern tip of York County.  This site is approximately 22 kilometers 
downstream from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  Circulation patterns 
at the Goodwin Islands are influenced by York River discharge and the wind 
patterns of the Chesapeake Bay.  The sampling station is located in a shallow 
embayment on the southeastern side of the main island amongst submerged aquatic 
vegetation beds dominated by Zostera marina and Ruppia maritima.  The Goodwin 
Islands represents a pristine, well-flushed polyhaline system with salinity 
ranges from 13-24 ppt and tidal ranges from 0.5-1.0 m. The salinity range for 
Goodwin Island 10-25 ppt.  Spartina alterniflora dominates the low marsh, which 
covers 70% of the emergent marsh area.  Estuarine scrub/shrub vegetation 
dominates the forested ridges, with the dominant shrub Myrica cerifera (wax 
myrtle).  The Goodwin Islands are undeveloped and only accessible by boat.  This 
site is used extensively by VIMS for SAV research.  

6.  Data collection period:
Ongoing sampling at Taskinas Creek (TC) began September 1995.  Ongoing sampling 
at Goodwin Islands (GI) began mid October 1997.  

7.  Associated researchers and projects:
A volunteer water quality monitoring program sponsored by the Alliance for the 
Chesapeake Bay has been ongoing at Taskinas Creek for several years, beginning 
January 10, 1990.  This project samples some overlapping parameters including 
dissolved oxygen and salinity on a two-week basis. The VIMS Virginia Nearshore 
Water Quality Monitoring Program has collected biweekly samples at Goodwin 
Islands since August 1994.  Measure parameters include dissolved inorganic 
nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, total suspended solids, photosynthetic 
active radiation, temperature, salinity, and water color.

9. Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions 

Site definitions: TC = Taskinas Creek, GI= Goodwin Islands 
File definitions: YSI deployment site/month/year (ex.: TC0995 = Taskinas Creek 
data from September 1995). 

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data):
Frequent data anomalies were recorded in depth levels for several months 
potentially due to low-pressure weather fronts.  This data remained in the 
database.  According to the CDMO Operations Manual Version 3.0, depth 
measurements taken with the non-vented level probe can be influenced by up to 
0.39 m (1.3 ft) during some low-pressure hurricane events.  Specific dates and 
time ranges of potentially influenced data are listed with each respective 
month.  Starting with July, data were extracted in accordance with Version 3.0 
of the CDMO Manual.

Note:  04/04/98 there was 1.84" of rain that fell, causing depressed DO levels 
and inflated turbidity levels.  
04/17/98 - 04/22/98 0.82" of rain fell also causing depressed DO levels and 
inflated turbidity levels.  

May 1998:
TC:
05/09/98 20:30:00 to 05/15/98 08:30:00	All DO data was suspect and deleted
The use of the netting around the YSI probe guard to reduce crab
colonization around the probes may have reduced the DO reading.  The
netting was deployed from 4-29-98 10:15:00 to 5-15-98 8:30:00.  After the
test, the netting was not used again.

Note:  05/11/98 01:30:00 to 05/19/98 10:15:00 missing data due to failure 
in logger cable clip which caused the datalogger to drop to the bottom until it

12. Remarks
Any regions of data with negative depth values due to low tides or low-pressure 
systems should be viewed with caution.  In some instances the probes are clearly 
out of water and have been noted.  Depth data should be considered relative 
depth. 

Please note that in December of 1997, construction work began and is ongoing at 
the York River State Park in an effort to reduce erosion problems from the steep 
banks into the creek.  This may be effecting the Taskinas Creek deployment 
readings, especially for turbidity.  All construction work is taking place about 
75 feet upstream from the deployment site.  

The Goodwin Islands February file from 02/19/98 10:30:27 to 02/28/98 23:45:27 
was off by +27 seconds, but was corrected.  

Several files were recorded in Daylight Savings Time instead of Eastern Standard 
Time (EST).  Tammy Dorman corrected the following files so that they would be in 
accordance with the NERR System Wide Monitoring Program by displaying the date 
and time in EST.  
	TC980415.csv was corrected to EST
	GI980414.csv was corrected to EST
