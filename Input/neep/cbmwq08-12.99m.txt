2. Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a PC from the YSI 6000UPG data logger and graphs are 
produced and quickly examined using the PC6000 software.  Data files are then 
exported from the PC6000 format into Excel (for Windows NT 3.1) files where the 
headers, footers, and inappropriate spaces are removed.  Plots of the data are 
made and suspect data (outliers) are dealt with accordingly.  Removed data 
points and missing data are replaced with a periods (.).  Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month for each data logger.  Data is then QA/QC'd 
using the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros and Appendix B., YSI 6000 Data Review and 
Editing Protocol.  Jill Rooth was responsible for data management.  

3. Research Objectives
The purpose of the monitoring program at CBM NERR is to conform to the NERR SWMP 
monitoring program looking at trends in water quality over both temporal and 
spatial scales.  Differences in how marshes can change water quality is being 
studied by comparing a marsh creek site to a river channel site.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes over a 5-14 day period at both the Patuxent River 
Park (PR) and Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) sites.  

4. Research methods (YSI data loggers)
Each YSI data logger is laid down on a 4" diameter PVC pipe that has been cut in 
half.  The PVC is nailed to a 4"x4" block of wood which secured to a crab pot.  
The crab pot with the data logger in it sits on the bottom at both sites.  At 
each site, the crab pot is locked to a pier.  The YSI probes sit approximately 
6-10 centimeters above the sediment.  Every 30 minutes up to a two-week period, 
measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved 
oxygen, temperature and water level are recorded.  Within 14 days of deployment, 
the data is downloaded and either new calibrated probes or a new YSI unit with 
calibrated probes are placed at each site.  At times, however, probes and/or 
units could not be replaced resulting in prolong periods (up to 5 days) of 
missing data.  Calibration procedures are carried out according to the methods 
described in the YSI Operating Manual.  All calibration standards are purchased 
from scientific warehouses.  

5. Site location and character
The Chesapeake Bay NERR - Maryland has three components in Maryland's portion of 
Chesapeake Bay.  Monie Bay is a mesohaline region on the lower Eastern Shore; 
Otter Point Creek is a tidal freshwater river and marsh system; and Jug Bay is 
part of the freshwater portion of the Patuxent River.  Both data loggers are 
within the Jug Bay component.

1) Patuxent River Park (PR) – (38 deg 46’ 00” N, 76 deg 42’ 30” W) is on the 
Prince Georges County side of the River.  The data logger 
is on the flank of the River channel off of Jackson Landing.   The Patuxent 
is approximately 50 
meters wide at Jackson Landing.  High sedimentation rates have led to a very 
soft bottom at this point in the Patuxent River.  Salinity rarely reaches above 
1 ppt.
2) Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) - (38 deg 46’ 00” N, 76 deg 42’ 30” W) is on 
the Anne Arundel County side of the River directly across from PR.  The data 
logger is in a shallow tidal marsh creek that is approximately 5 meters wide.  
Wide temperature fluctuations are normal at this site. Salinity rarely 
reaches above 1 ppt. 

6. Data collection period
Data loggers initiated collection in August 1999 and continued through the end 
of December of 1999, at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) only.  The logger did 
not collect any data for the year 2000 at Patuxent River Park (PR) due to 
malfunctioning equipment.

7. Associated researchers and projects
The Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary staff have been collecting weekly to monthly 
temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient samples at the same 
location as the data logger at JB.

11. Data anomalies (suspect data)
Suspect and outlier data from any measurement collected was replaced with a 
period (.).  This is in accordance with the QA/QC procedure.  There was no 
"true" suspect data observed for the year 1999, although outliers were removed 
throughout the 1999 time period and are believed to be the result of internal 
datasonde error.
