2.	Entry verification
	The data are downloaded from the YSI 6000s to an IBM compatible PC.  
Graphs of all data are printed using PC6000 software and are examined for 
suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  Files are converted to Macintosh Excel 
files and edited for transfer to the NERRS CDMO.  Files are merged to contain 
one full month of data.  Missing data (from maintenance and downloading down 
time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by a period (.).  
Suspect data are deleted and replaced by periods (.).  After formatting the 
data, some files are more closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro® in 
lieu of CDMO Excel macros.   Edited and raw files are archived on a Macintosh 
hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR.  This process of entry verification was 
completed by Robin Cottrell, Nicole Rutherford, Heather Defenderfer, and Douglas 
Bulthuis for the 1997 data.  Final verification of this metadata documentation 
were completed by Douglas Bulthuis.

3.	Research Objectives
	The Bay View Channel YSI 6000 has been set out to detect and monitor 
short-term variability and long-term changes in Padilla Bay.  The Joe Leary 
Slough YSI 6000 has been set at the mouth of the slough to measure the effects 
of  tidal "closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough and to detect long-
term changes in water quality in the slough associated with implementation of a 
non point source pollution watershed action plan.  The No Name Slough YSI 6000 
has been set at the mouth of No Name Slough to detect seasonal and long-term 
changes in water quality of the slough associated with residential development 
in the watershed and changes associated with experimental farming methods 
designed to reduce non-point source pollution to No Name Slough.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes at all three sites unless otherwise noted in data 
anomalies.

4.	Research methods
	A YSI 6000 was deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical position, 0.25 m 
above the bottom of the slough, in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe which has holes and 
slits drilled in it to allow water circulation around the probes.  The PVC pipe 
is attached to a steel pipe which was driven into the sediment.  During the 
course of examining the data during the first half of 1997, it was noted that on 
some occasions the dissolved oxygen (and to a lesser extent turbidity and pH) 
seemed to change during the course of deployment.  Accumulation of sediment and 
restricted flow through the holes of the PVC pipe were suspected but could not 
be independently confirmed.  On June 25, 1997, the PVC pipe was removed and 
larger holes cut in the pipe in the vicinity of the sensors.  Thus, after June 
25, 1997, there was probably greater flow of Joe Leary Slough water past the 
sensors.  Data from January 1 through June 25 should be interpreted with some 
caution because of the possibility of restricted water flow past the sensors.

	A YSI 6000 was deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview Channel.  
It was deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, except that 
the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes.   The depth of the YSI was -1.1 m 
(depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the sloping edge of a 
small channel draining the surrounding intertidal flats. 

	A YSI 6000 was deployed in No Name Slough using the same design as that in 
Joe Leary Slough, except that the PVC pipe was attached to a piling supporting a 
pump house in front of the tide gates.  The YSI 6000 sensors are about 0.20 m 
above the bottom.

	In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth and pH are recorded 
every half-hour.  At the end of each sampling period, the YSI 6000 is brought 
back into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration.   

	All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 6000 
Operation and Service Manual.  For the conductivity calibration a conductivity 
standard of 50 mS/cm was used.  The pH calibration is a 2-point calibration 
using standard pH buffer solutions with a pH of 7 and 10.  The KCl solution and 
Teflon membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6000 
deployment and the new oxygen membrane is allowed to soak overnight in water 
before calibration.
	
5.	Site location and character
	General Padilla Bay (48° 30' N; 122° 30' W) is a shallow embayment in 
northern Puget Sound.  The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera 
marina, which covers approximately 3,000 ha.  Zostera japonica, a recent invader 
to the region, now covers about 350 ha of the bay.  Tides are mixed semi-diurnal 
with a mean range of 1.55 m.  Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU.

	Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer 
empties directly into it.  Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed 
is agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay.  The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located.  
Major freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary 
come from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit River 
to the south.

	Joe Leary Slough Site  (48° 31' 05" N; 122° 28' 25" W) Joe Leary Slough 
drains land which is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture land with 
some low density housing.  The slough is characterized by high fecal and 
nutrient inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  
During the summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m.  
During winter flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m.   There is a dam at 
the mouth of the slough with twelve 4 ft diameter outfall pipes that have one-
way hinged tide gates.   Saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through the tide 
gates during high tide. The bottom of the slough is composed of very soft 
sediment, which is periodically dredged.  A YSI 6000 is deployed on the 
freshwater side of the tide gates at a depth of about 0.25-m above the bottom.  

	Bayview Channel Site  (48° 29' 47" N; 122° 30' 07" W) Bayview Channel, a 
major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macrovegetation.  
The YSI 6000 is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel.  The 
tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) covered 
intertidal flats.  Bottom sediments beneath the YSI 6000 are fine silt and clay 
overlying sand.   The YSI 6000 is deployed in a black PVC pipe that is attached 
to two steel pipes set in the sediment.  When deployed, the datasonde is located 
about 0.75 m above the bottom.  Pollutants entering the bay include general non-
point source, agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliform bacteria from 
agriculture, failing septic tanks and wildlife.

	No Name Slough Site  (48° 28' 09" N; 122° 28' 03" W).  No Name Slough 
drains a 990 ha watershed composed of an "upland" portion of rural, pasture, 
woodlot, and low density housing land use on a glacial moraine; and a 
"floodplain" portion of intensive annual crop agriculture on drained marsh land.  
The slough water is characterized by periodic high turbidity, high salinity in 
the lower part of the slough most of the year, and algal blooms in the lower 
slough during the summer.  During summer, there is little or no freshwater flow 
in the slough and depth ranges from 0.25-0.50 m.  During winter flooding, water 
depth at the mouth can be as high as 2 m.  No Name Slough flows into Padilla Bay 
through 4 tide gates that have been placed in the sea dike.  Saline water seeps 
through the tide gates, under the dike, or through the dike so that water is 
usually partially saline at the mouth of the slough on the "freshwater" side of 
the dike where the YSI 6000 is located.  Two pumps are located at the mouth of 
No Name Slough.  These pump water over the dike into Padilla Bay during times of 
high rainfall and high tides when water depth in the slough reaches preset 
depths.  Bottom sediments in No Name Slough are very soft.  The YSI 6000 is 
deployed 0.20 m above the bottom on the freshwater side of the dike on one of 
the piles supporting the pump house.

6.	Data collection period
	Data collection was continuous from January 1 to December 31 at all sites 
except for times of downloading, cleaning and recalibration as noted in the 
missing data section.

*During 1997 records were kept of the atmospheric pressure during calibration of 
depth and the apparent depth after each two to four week deployment.  The data 
indicated that depth readings could read as much as 0.28 m above or below true 
depth.  Therefore, although the sensor may accurately read ± 0.001 m, changes 
in atmospheric pressure when deployed indicate depth may be ± 0.3 m.

10.	Data anomalies
January 1997
JL:   Water flow past the sensors may have been restricted throughout the 
month-see note (above) in "4. Research Methods".  The cause for erratic 
negative and positive turbidity values from 0000 on 1 Jan through 
1430 on 16 Jan is not known; the data were removed.  The cause for 
anomalous turbidity values of 1114 at 1930 and -914 at 2100 on 29 
Jan are not known; the data were removed.  Erratic pH values up to 
0.5 pH units lower than values recorded before or after were observed 
throughout January, the cause is not known.  The cause for negative 
dissolved oxygen readings at 1300 on 14 Jan, 0900 on 15 Jan, and 
1000, 1100, and 1430 on 16 Jan are not known; the data were 
removed.  Some very low dissolved oxygen concentrations were 
recorded from 1 Jan through 1430 on 16 Jan; the cause is unknown;  
post-deployment checks of the dissolved oxygen probe indicated 90% in 
water saturated air following the deployment.
BY:   The cause for an anomalous turbidity value of 653 at 1730 4 Jan is not 
known; the datum was removed.
NN:   Negative temperatures were recorded from 0530 to 0730 on 26 Jan and 
from 0300 to 0800 on 27 Jan.  The cause for erratic high and negative 
turbidity values a during the following times are not known; the data 
were removed:  0000 to 1500 on 1 Jan, 1730 6 Jan to 0300 7 Jan, 
1000 to 1430 on 18 Jan, 2330 19 Jan to 0200 20 Jan, 0600 to 0730 on 
23 Jan, and 2000 29 Jan to 0900 30 Jan.

February 1997  
JL:   Water flow past the sensors may have been restricted throughout the 
month-see note (above) in "4. Research Methods".  Turbidity values 
from 1200 on 4 Feb through 1330 on 12 Feb may have been reading 
about 25% high because old solution had been used for calibration.  
High turbidity values from 1400 through 1700 on 12 February may 
have been related to impending battery failure; data were deleted.  
Dissolved oxygen data from 1400 on 27 Feb through 2330 on 28 Feb 
may be somewhat low: post-deployment checks of the dissolved oxygen 
probe indicated 80.3% in water saturated air following deployment; the 
probe surface also needed to be reconditioned after deployment.
BY:   
NN:   The cause for erratic high and negative turbidity values a during the 
following times are not known; the data were removed:  0630 on 1 Feb, 
0630 to 1400 on 12 Feb, 0600 to 2200 on 14 Feb, 0200 to 0400 on 17 
Feb, and 1100 to 1700 on 19 Feb.

March 1997
JL:   Water flow past the sensors may have been restricted throughout the 
month-see note (above) in "4. Research Methods".  Dissolved oxygen 
data from 0000 on 1 Mar through 0430 on 4 Mar may be somewhat 
low: post-deployment checks of the dissolved oxygen probe indicated 
80.3% in water saturated air following deployment; the probe surface 
also needed to be reconditioned after deployment.  The dissolved oxygen 
data from 0500 on 4 Mar through 1230 on 13 Mar were deleted 
because the probe appeared to be failing and could not be calibrated in 
the lab following the deployment.  Low dissolved oxygen values, which 
may not be accurate, were observed from 2330 on 19 Mar through 
1230 on 27 Mar and negative dissolved oxygen data at 1430 on 21 Mar 
and 1030 on 22 Mar were deleted; the cause for the low and negative 
dissolved oxygen readings is unknown but may be related to low flow or 
accumulation of sediment near sensors; low dissolved oxygen values 
were associated with lower salinity and possibly higher rainfall.  Low 
dissolved oxygen values were observed from 1200 on 29 Mar through 
2330 on 31 Mar; cause is unknown; data were deleted.  Negative depth 
readings were recorded at the following times and were probably related 
to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab (see note 
above in 9. Variable identifier, data type, resolution and accuracy);  
1700-1800 on 30 Mar.  Negative turbidity values were recorded 1330 
and 1500 on 3 March associated with very high turbidity values.  The 
cause(s) for erratic negative and very high turbidity values from 2130 
on 7 Mar through 1230 on 13 Mar and from 1100 on 14 Mar through 
1230 on 27 Mar are not known; the data were removed.  The cause for 
high and erratic turbidity values from 1200 on 29 Mar through 2330 31 
Mar is not known; the data were removed.
BY:   The cause for an anomalous turbidity value of -167 at 0930 25 Mar is 
not known; the datum was removed.  
NN:   

April 1997
JL:   Water flow past the sensors may have been restricted throughout the 
month-see note (above) in "4. Research Methods".  Low dissolved 
oxygen values were observed from 0000 on 1 Apr through 0800 on 10 
Apr; cause is unknown but may be related to low flow or accumulation 
of sediment near sensors; data were deleted.  Negative depth readings 
were recorded at the following times and were probably related to 
changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab (see note 
above in 9. Variable identifier, data type, resolution and accuracy);  
1400-1600 on 26 Apr, 1500-1730 on 28 Apr, and 1800-1830 on 29 Apr.  
The cause for high and erratic turbidity values from 0000 on 1 Apr 
through 0800 on 10 Apr is not known; the data were removed.  
Negative turbidity values were observed at the following times; cause is 
unknown but may be related to low flow or accumulation of sediment 
near sensors; data were deleted:  0600, 0630, 0800-0900 on 11 Apr, 
0830-0930, 1030 on 12 April, 1030, 1100 on 14 April.  Erratic negative 
and very high turbidity values from 0600 through 1400 on 15 April 
were removed; cause unknown.  High turbidity values at 1330 and 
1400 on 24 Apr may have been caused by disturbance of the datasonde 
when checking the deployment.
BY:   The cause for an anomalous turbidity value of 384 at 1500 10 Apr is 
not known; the datum was removed.  Slight negative values for 
turbidity were recorded on April 15, 18, 23, 24, 25, and 28.  The cause 
is not known but these slight negative turbidity values probably 
indicate drift of the zero line during deployment.
NN:   Anomalous and erratic turbidity values were recorded from 1500 on 24 
April to 2330 on 30 April; a cracked probe was noted when the 
datasonde was retrieved; the data were removed.

May 1997
JL:   Water flow past the sensors may have been restricted throughout the 
month-see note (above) in "4. Research Methods".  The dissolved oxygen 
data may be low or unreliable from 1000 23 May through 2330 31 May 
because the sensor read 85.5% dissolved oxygen in water saturated air 
in a post-deployment calibration check.  Negative dissolved oxygen 
values were recorded sporadically throughout the month and were 
deleted from the data set (See below "12. Missing data" for specific 
times and dates.)
BY:    The dissolved oxygen data may be low or unreliable throughout the 
month because the sensor read 78.7% dissolved oxygen in water 
saturated air in a post-deployment calibration check. No turbidity data 
from 1400 on 23 May through 2330 on 31 May because erratic values 
were recorded and a faulty wiper was discovered at the end of the 
deployment.  
NN:   A negative depth reading was recorded at 1430 on 23 May and was 
probably related to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in 
the lab (see note above in 9. Variable identifier, data type, resolution 
and accuracy.)  Anomalous and erratic turbidity values were recorded 
from 0000 1 May to 2330 31 May; a cracked probe was noted when the 
datasonde was retrieved; the data were removed.  High diurnal 
dissolved oxygen fluctuations during May were associated with a 
filamentous algal bloom in No Name Slough.

June 1997
JL:   Water flow past the sensors may have been restricted from 0000 1 Jun 
through 1400 on 25 Jun-see note (above) in "4. Research Methods".  
The dissolved oxygen data may be low or unreliable from 0000 1 Jun 
through 1330 on 11 Jun because the sensor read 85.5% dissolved 
oxygen in water saturated air in a post-deployment calibration check.  
Negative dissolved oxygen values were recorded sporadically 
throughout the month and were deleted from the data set (See below 
"12. Missing data" for specific times and dates.)  A negative depth 
reading was recorded at 1230 on 25 Jun and was probably related to 
changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab (see note 
above in 9. Variable identifier, data type, resolution and accuracy.)  The 
causes for negative turbidity values at 1230 on 7 Jun and at 2230 on 
16 June are not known; the data were removed.
BY:   No turbidity data from 0000 on 1 June through 0930 on 26 June 
because erratic values were recorded and a faulty wiper was discovered 
at the end of the deployment.  The dissolved oxygen data may be low or 
unreliable from 00:00 on 01 Jun through 09:30 on 26 June because 
the sensor read 78.7% dissolved oxygen in water saturated air in a 
post-deployment calibration check.  pH data from 10:00 on 26Jun 
through 23:30 on 30Jun may be unreliable because post-deployment 
calibration indicated a reading of 7.31 in pH 7.00 standard.  The cause 
for an anomalous turbidity value of 96 at 1430 26 Jun is not known; 
the datum was removed. No dissolved oxygen from 1000 on 26 June 
through 2330 on 30 June because at the end of the deployment it was 
found that the oxygen membrane was punctured. 
NN:   Anomalous and erratic turbidity values were recorded from 0000 1 Jun 
to 0900 on 4 Jun; a cracked probe was noted when the datasonde was 
retrieved; the data were removed.  High diurnal dissolved oxygen 
fluctuations during June were associated with a filamentous algal 
bloom in No Name Slough.

July 1997
JL:   The cause for single anomalous turbidity values of 0 at 830 on 15 July 
and of  177 at 1800 on 22 July are not known; these data were 
removed.
BY:   No dissolved oxygen from 0000 on 1 July through 0800 on 23 July 
because at the end of the deployment it was found that the oxygen 
membrane was punctured.  The cause for anomalous turbidity values 
of 115 at 1530 on 14 July and of 38 at 1930 on 18 July are not known; 
these data were removed.
NN:   High diurnal dissolved oxygen fluctuations during July were associated 
with filamentous algal blooms in No Name Slough.  The cause for an 
anomalous high turbidity value at 0130 on 16 July is not known.

August 1997
JL:   No dissolved oxygen data from 1400 on 13 Aug through 1100 on 27 Aug 
because the data were considered unreliable because the sensor read 
78.4% dissolved oxygen in water saturated air in a post-deployment 
calibration check.  The dissolved oxygen data may be low or unreliable 
from 1200 on 27 Aug through 2330 on 31 Aug  because the sensor read 
80.3% dissolved oxygen in water saturated air in a post-deployment 
calibration check.  Isolated anomalous turbidity values were deleted 
(cause unknown) at the following times: readings of 210 at 1530 on 
5Aug, 687 at 0100 20Aug, -570 at 1800 on 23Aug, -146 at 0330 on 
27Aug, 166 at 1030 on 27Aug.
BY:   No turbidity data from 0630 on 20 Aug through 2330 on 31 Aug 
because the turbidity probe failed.
NN:   No dissolved oxygen data from 1400 on 20 Aug to 2330 on 31 Aug 
because dissolved oxygen probe was broken on retrieval.

September 1997
JL:   The dissolved oxygen data may be low or unreliable from 0000 on 1 Sep 
through 1130 on 17 Sep because the sensor read 80.3% dissolved 
oxygen in water saturated air in a post-deployment calibration check.  
The times that the sensors were read and recorded were 6 seconds past 
the half hour from 0930 18 Sep through 2330 on 30 Sep.  The cause 
for a single negative dissolved oxygen value at 1930 on 8 Sep is not 
known; the datum was removed.  The cause for single anomalous 
turbidity value of -218 at 0300 on 24 Sep is not known; the datum was 
removed.
BY:   From the 10th to the 30th of September the dissolved oxygen values are 
lower than usual; the cause is unknown; post-deployment checks of 
the dissolved oxygen probe indicated 90.5% and 92.5% in water 
saturated air following the 2 deployments.   The dissolved oxygen data 
from 0900 on 19 September through 2330 on 30 September should be 
interpreted with caution: post-deployment diagnostics of the dissolved 
oxygen probe after this deployment were acceptable, but the probe 
failed after the next deployment.  Slight negative values for turbidity 
were recorded on Sep 19-25 and 28-29.  The cause is not known but 
these slight negative turbidity values probably indicate drift of the zero 
line during deployment. No turbidity data from 0000 on 01 September 
through 0830 on 19 September because the turbidity probe failed.
NN:   No dissolved oxygen data from 0000 1 Sep to 1030 10 Sep because the 
dissolved oxygen probe was broken on retrieval.  Negative dissolved 
oxygen data were recorded at the following times and removed from the 
data record:  0700 13 Sep, 0630 20 Sep, 0730 21 Sep, 0730 and 0830 
to 0900 25 Sep, and 2030 to 2100 30 Sep. No turbidity data from 1230 
25 Sep to 2330 on 30 Sep because the turbidity probe was broken on 
retrieval.  

October 1997
JL:   The times that the sensors were read and recorded were 6 seconds past 
the half hour from 0000 through 1030 on 1 Oct.  The dissolved oxygen 
data may be low or unreliable from 1000 23 Oct through 2330 31 Oct 
because the sensor read 86.2% dissolved oxygen in water saturated air 
in a post-deployment calibration check, and an orange coating was 
observed on the membrane and probe following deployment.  During 
periods of very low dissolved oxygen negative readings were recorded at 
the following times, these data were removed:  0300, 1730, 1900, 2230, 
and 2330 on 5 Oct;  0200, 0230, 0400, 0500, 0600, 1400, 1500, 1600, 
1630, 1730, 1930, 2000, 2100, and 2200-2330 on 6 Oct;   0200, 0400, 
0500, 0600-0700, 0800, 0900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400-1500, 
1600, 1700-1730, and 2130-2330 on 7 Oct;  0000-0030 on 8 Oct;  
0930, 1500, 1630, and 1930 on 14 Oct;  1230-1400, 1900, and 2100 
on 16 Oct;  1330, 1430-1630, and 2200 on 19 Oct;  0400 on 20 Oct;  
0500, 0730, and 1930 on 25Oct;  0300 on 26Oct;  and 0100 on 30Oct.  
The cause for single anomalous turbidity value of 464 at 2000 on 31 
Oct is not known; the datum was removed.
BY:    The low dissolved oxygen data from 0000 on 1 October through 1300 
on 10 October are suspect and should be interpreted with caution;  
post-deployment check indicated 92.2% saturation in water saturated 
air following deployment, the probe diagnostics were acceptable, but 
the probe failed one month later.   Depth data erratic from 1400 10 
October through 0830 on 11 October indicating the datasonde was not 
properly seated in deployment tube:  data for all sensors removed.  
NN:   Dissolved oxygen data from 0000 1 Oct to 0530 10 Oct is suspect 
because of downward trend in concentration of dissolved oxygen and 
occasional negative dissolved oxygen recorded; however, the post-
deployment check indicated 98.3% saturation in water saturated air 
following deployment.  Negative dissolved oxygen data were recorded at 
the following times and removed from the data record:  0530 to 1330 
and 1430 to 1600 on 2 Oct, 1000 to 1100 on 6 Oct, 0130-0700 and 
1000 to 1500 on 8 Oct, 1030 to 1130 on 9 Oct.  Numerous negative 
dissolved oxygen data were observed from 0600 on 10 Oct to 1000 on 
15 October, data were removed from the file. No dissolved oxygen data 
from 1030 15 Oct to 2330 31 Oct because dissolved oxygen probe was 
bad on retrieval.  No turbidity data from 0000 1 Oct to 1000 15 Oct 
because turbidity probe was broken on retrieval.

November 1997
JL:   The dissolved oxygen data may be low or unreliable from 0000 1 Nov 
through 1330 18 Nov because the sensor read 86.2% dissolved oxygen 
in water saturated air in a post-deployment calibration check, and an 
orange coating was observed on the membrane and probe following 
deployment.    During periods of very low dissolved oxygen negative 
readings were recorded at the following times, these data were removed:  
0300 and 0330 on 1 Nov; 0300 on 2 Nov; 0600, 0630, and 0830-0930 
on 5 Nov; 2300-2330 on 11 Nov; 0030 and 0130 on 12 Nov; 0000 and 
0130 on 13 Nov; 0230, 2130, and 2330 on 14 Nov; 0100, 0200, and 
0330 on 15 Nov; and 0000, 0800, and 1100 on 16 Nov.  Negative depth 
readings were recorded at the following times and were probably related 
to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in the lab (see note 
above in 9. Variable identifier, data type, resolution and accuracy);  
0100-0500 on 19 Nov,  0330 on 20 Nov,  2200-2300 on 26 Nov,  2230 
on 27 Nov to 0000 on 28 Nov,  0000-0030 on 29 Nov,  and 0000-0100 
on 30 Nov.  Erratic negative and very high turbidity readings from 0800 
through 1930 on 11 Nov were deleted; the cause is not known but 
could be incorrect parking of wiper or debris caught on wiper.  Isolated 
anomalous turbidity values were deleted (cause unknown) at the 
following times: readings of -222 at 0330 on 21 Nov, -635 at 1900 on 
27 Nov, 450 at 0500 on 28 Nov, and 731 at 0600 on 28 Nov.
BY:   No data for all parameters from 1400 on 25 November through 2330 on 
30 November because the depth and salinity data indicated that the 
datasonde was caught in the PVC deployment tube and the probes 
were out of the water for part of each day.
NN:   No dissolved oxygen data from 0000 1 Nov to 2200 10 Nov because 
dissolved oxygen probe was broken on retrieval.

December 1997
JL:    Negative depth readings were recorded at the following times and were 
probably related to changes in barometric pressure after calibration in 
the lab (see note above in 9. Variable identifier, data type, resolution 
and accuracy);  0230-0300 on 2 Dec.  Isolated anomalous turbidity 
values were deleted (cause unknown) at the following times: readings of 
141 and 332 at 0130 and 0200 on 13 Dec 613 at 2300 on 31 Dec and 
negative readings at 1900 and 1930 on 28 Dec and 2130 on 31 Dec.
BY:   All data suspect and need to be interpreted with caution because 
probes had been exposed to the air during spring lower low water.  
Depth data is relative because datasonde was caught in the 
deployment tube at an unknown depth.  Negative depths were recorded 
from 0330-0400 on 7 Dec.  Depth above bottom is not known but is 
estimated to have been about 1.75 m. 
NN:   Negative depths were recorded from 5 Dec to 20 Dec and from 30 to 31 
Dec.  Erratic negative and high turbidity data were recorded at the 
following times and removed from the data record:  0300 on 11 Dec, 
0530 on 14 Dec, 0830 on 19 Dec, and 0130 on 23 Dec.

unknown) at the following times: readings of -222 at 0330 on 21 Nov, -
635 at 1900 on 27 Nov, 450 at 0500 on 28 Nov, and 731 at 0600 on 28 
Nov.
BY:   No data for all parameters at 1330 on 13 November because of 
exchange of datasondes for cleaning and calibration.  No data for all 
parameters from 1400 on 25 November through 2330 on 30 November 
because the depth and salinity data indicated that the datasonde was 
caught in the PVC deployment tube and the probes were out of the 
water for part of each day.
NN:   No data for all parameters from 2230 on 10 Nov to 1130 on 14 Nov and 
from 1500 on 17 Nov to 1630 on 19 Nov because of exchange of 
datasondes for cleaning and calibration.  No dissolved oxygen data from 
0000 1 Nov to 2200 10 Nov because dissolved oxygen probe was broken 
on retrieval.

December 1997
JL:   No data for all parameters from 1330 on 22 Dec through 1230 on 23 
Dec because of exchange of datasondes for cleaning, maintenance and 
calibration.  No turbidity readings for the following times because 
isolated erratic negative and high values were removed:  0130 and 0200 
on 13 Dec, 1900 and 1930 on 28 Dec, 2130  and 2300 on 31 Dec.
BY:   No data for all parameters from 0000 on 1 Dec through 0430 on 6 Dec, 
from 1830 on 9 Dec through 0300 on 20 Dec and 1930 on 23 Dec 
through 2330 on 31 Dec because the depth and salinity data indicated 
that the datasonde was caught in the PVC deployment tube and the 
probes were out of the water for part of each day during these time 
periods.
NN:   No data for all parameters at 1500 on 3 Dec and from 1130 on 29 Dec 
to 1300 on 30 Dec because of exchange of datasondes for cleaning, 
maintenance and calibration.  No turbidity data at the following times 
because erratic negative and high turbidity data were recorded and 
removed from the data record:  0300 on 11 Dec, 0530 on 14 Dec, 0830 
on 19 Dec, and 0130 on 23 Dec.
