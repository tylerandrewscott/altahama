2) Entry Verification Process:

The data are uploaded using the computer program EcoWatch that accompanies the 
YSI 6000 datalogger.  After the file is uploaded from the water quality 
instrument, EcoWatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.dev.).  This information is printed out 
and attached to the Field Log for the particular deployment. This printout is 
used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when the 
water quality instrument was removed from the water or those caused by 
instrument failure. The data are imported into a Microsoft Excel file that 
contains the current month's cumulative recordings. When a complete month of 
data has been recorded the file is then reviewed.  The first step is to format 
the data so that the parameter columns are in the correct order and the data 
have the correct number of decimal place holders. The CDMO 5.0 Excel macro is 
used to check for any dates and times that data were not recorded due to 
maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates and times are 
inserted into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where data would 
normally be. An explanation for the missing data is recorded onto the Water 
Quality Editing Log.  Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro to find 
readings outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range 
for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are removed from the 
file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing 
dates and times are recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside 
the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site were investigated for 
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, 
and instrument diagnostics. If the data are rejected from the file a period is 
inserted into the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and 
times are recorded onto metadata form.  The metadata form is then submitted with 
the data file to the CDMO.  William Thompson, Research Technician, was 
responsible for data management during 1999.  


3) Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island 
components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve and are 
anchored to the bottom of the selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30 
minute intervals for approximately two week periods. These sites are 
relatively unimpacted by manmade perturbations and are considered long-term 
monitoring locations.  The goal is to establish long-term water quality 
monitoring at relatively unimpacted sites by collecting data for each day of the 
year.  


4) Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March 1992 at the 
Masonboro Island component, and 19 May 1994 at the Zeke's Island component. The 
procedures described below were instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover 
data recorded previously. At this time we are only performing long-term water 
quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed 
following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections 
3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are only required for pH, turbidity and 
salinity; all other parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer 
solutions for 3 point pH calibration (pH 4,7 and 10) are purchased pre-made from 
a scientific supply house. The salinity standard is obtained from filtered 
seawater taken from Masonboro Sound and analyzed at the Center for Marine 
Science Research (CMSR) in Wilmington, NC using an osmometer. The dissolved 
oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed to settle at 
least 24 hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in the 
field observation log. Measurements of DO, pH, salinity, specific conductance, 
and temperature are taken with a calibrated YSI 6000 or other field instruments 
to check the accuracy of the instrumentation before deployment (as of October 
1995). The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked steel cage, then 
anchored approximately 10cm off the bottom, and chained to a post at the 
monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period measurements are 
taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity, dissolved oxygen 
saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, pH, and turbidity. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is brought back to 
the laboratory.  The weather and water quality measurements are again noted in 
the field observation log. The calibration drift and the effect of biofouling on 
the water quality instrument are checked by comparing data readings in 
calibration standards. The water quality data are then uploaded, and the 
instrument is cleaned and calibrated as noted previously. 


5) Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(from north to south) are: Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and 
Zeke's Island. They are located along the southeastern coast of the United 
States in the Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro and 
Zeke's Island components are transferred to the CDMO. The two sites are: 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of Whiskey Creek, 
and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a small navigable channel called 
Research Creek at 34 deg 09' 21.7" latitude and 77 deg 50' 59.9" longitude. The 
site has a salinity range of 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.2 
meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found to range from 0.38 to 2.11 
meters.  Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus based sediment.  
There are no major pollutants from the land.  The site is removed from the 
shoreline, in a creek surrounded by salt marsh that has minimal to no boat 
traffic.  

2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island
The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal Point boat launch in a 
tidal basin estuary at 33 deg 56' 23.5" latitude and 77 deg 56' 28.1" longitude. 
This site receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear River 
through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies of water. Thus, the 
ocean tidal input through New Inlet is a major factor in maintaining the high 
salinity; however, during rainy periods major drops in salinity may occur. The 
site has a salinity range of 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2 meters.
Depth varies, but typically it can be found to range from 0.11 to 2.30 meters.  
Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus based sediment.  There are 
no pollutants from land. The site is surrounded by marsh and dunes not 
accessible to road traffic and minimal boat traffic.  

6) Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while
East Cribbing data collection commenced on 19 May 1994. Both continue through 
December 31 of this year.

units for each column.


9) Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions:

Site definitions:		RC= South Research Creek, Masonboro Island* 
 				EC= East Crib, Zeke's Island*

File definitions: site/month/year (ex.: zi0899 = Zeke's Island
				     data from August of 1999). 

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zeke’s Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserve’s historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.

10) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section list data that is extreme for the aquatic system being monitored 
or are outside the measurement range of the instrument. The cause of such 
anomalies maybe a bad calibration, boat traffic disturbances, malfunction of the 
instrument, or the measurements may be correct.

11) Missing data:

This section lists any missing data within the corresponding data files. Missing 
data maybe caused by many reasons including maintenance periods, power loss, and 
data that have been removed because of instrument malfunction. Approximately 
every 2-3 weeks, there may be a period of between 1 to 24 hrs (occasionally 
longer) of missing data due to maintenance and calibration. During the 
maintenance period all parameters will be missing.

A record and explanation of missing data that are not related to routine 
maintenance is kept in the Field Log for the particular deployment. All 
parameters recorded when the water quality instrument is exposed to air 
during a sample, either by an extremely low tide or physical displacement from 
its original location, are removed. Special note should be made regarding 
missing dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (%), DO concentration (mg/l), specific 
conductance, salinity, and temperature measurements. If the DO saturation 
(%) data are removed, due to sensor malfunction or other circumstances, the DO 
concentration (mg/l) will also be missing. The DO concentration (mg/l) is 
calculated from DO saturation (%) and temperature data. This is also true for 
specific conductance and salinity data. Salinity (ppt) is determined by the YSI 
6000 using specific conductance and temperature data. If the temperature sensor 
malfunctions and the corresponding data are removed, all parameters requiring 
these data (DO saturation, DO concentration, specific conductance, salinity, and 
pH) for calculation or temperature compensation will also be removed.

12) Notes:

High turbidity values above instruments top range (1000 NTU), caused by blockage 
of light transmittance by an obstruction are left in the file.

Start of each sample was delayed in the ms0899 file by from 9 to 5 minutes after 
the hour and half hour.  Time was corrected in the file to the hour and half 
hour.
