2.	Entry Verification (S. Phipps):

	Data are uploaded to the PC from the Data loggers and graphs are produced 
using the EcoWatch software.  Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may 
result from probe failure.  Notes are made of any unusual data, and sensors are 
reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .csv files using the 
EcoWatch software.  The .csv files are imported into EXCEL, edited by removing 
headers and footers, and saved as EXCEL files.  Data at the beginning and end of 
each data record that were recorded when the instruments were out of the water 
are deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document the times 
in and out of the water, and by unusual depth data (usually negative or near 
zero).  The appropriate files are merged to form complete monthly data sets and 
are saved as separate EXCEL files.  Data that are missing because the 
instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are denoted by 
periods (.).  These times are noted in section 11 (Missing Data) of this 
document. Two types of post-calibration values are also used to determine 
operational viability of the sensors while deployed.  One is obtained in the lab 
by placing uncleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values given 
by the Data loggers.  The second type is obtained in the field using a newly 
calibrated Data logger (referred to as a control sonde).  Data from this 
instrument are recorded in the field at the time of the last scheduled reading 
by the deployed Data loggers.  Both post-calibration values are reported in 
section 12 (Other Remarks/Notes) of this document, and may be used to determine 
the quality of the data recorded by the instruments (particularly DO) after two 
weeks in the field.  Any erroneous data that are identified as being caused by 
probe failures (as determined upon examination of the data plots, or by post-
calibration values) are deleted and replaced with periods, and noted in section 
11 (Missing Data) of this document.  Sensor readings that greatly deviate from 
known values of standards after the two week deployment are not necessarily 
believed to be a result of probe failure, however.  If biofouling is believed to 
be the reason for poor agreement between the sensors and the standard values at 
the end of a deployment, the data are retained and noted in section 10 (Data 
Anomalies) of this document.  Symptoms of probe failures are extreme noise in 
the record, unrealistically high or negative data, or noisy or negative readings 
in standard solutions.  Examples of many such failures are given in the CDMO 
Manual (Version 3.0). .  Finally, the CDMO macros (update version 11/96) are 
then run on these new monthly files to identify missing times and/or dates, to 
format the width and decimal places of columns, and to identify outliers and 
other erroneous data.  Data was reviewed and metadata prepared by Scott Phipps.

3.	Research Objectives/Study Purpose:

	The Data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 
30 minutes.  Presently, two instruments are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve.  
One is located at the mouth of Fish River (provides ~73% of Weeks Bay's 
freshwater), and the other is located the eastern side of Weeks Bay, near the 
mouth.
	Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon 
Secour Bay.  Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show 
that bottom waters (which flow into Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic 
in summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also in question, as 
largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during 
periods of high flow in the river.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if 
poor water quality periodically observed in Weeks Bay is generated within the 
bay proper, or is being washed in from Fish River or Bon Secour Bay with 
changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these 
two sites may be used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.  
	There is a great deal of value in having a baseline data set for any 
management site.  Changes in any monitored parameters are readily apparent.  
Weeks Bay is a useful model estuary and this data is necessary for the profile 
of this model. 

4.	Research Methods:

	Data loggers are moored on private docks.  At each dock, a PVC tube is 
attached to a piling at the end of the dock using ratchets equipped with zinc 
disks (to help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A chain, attached to the cap 
of the tube, is shackled to the bail of the Data logger.  Chains and tubes were 
cut to a length that places the Data logger probes just below the bottom of the 
tube and 0.5 m above the sediment when in place.  A nylon rope tied to the 
bottom of the piling also runs through the tube and is attached to the bale of 
the Data logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the Data loggers in 
the event that the tube breaks away from the piling.
	The Data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific 
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation and 
concentration, pH, water level and turbidity every 30 minutes, central standard 
time (CST).  A newly calibrated Data logger is also used to record the above 
parameters at the same time the deployed YSI takes its first reading to insure 
initial accuracy of the YSI.  The instruments are usually serviced (instruments 
post-calibrated, data uploaded, instruments cleaned and recalibrated) every 14 
days; however, they are programmed to log for 30 days in the event they cannot 
be serviced on schedule.  Just before deployment, window screening (1mm mesh 
size) is wrapped once around the cage that protects the sensors, and secured 
with plastic cable ties.  Window screening is also secured in the bottom of the 
cage with silicone sealant.  This is done to reduce error in the data that may 
be due to larger animals moving in and out of the cage during the deployment.  
This does not, however, preclude smaller animals such as barnacle and polychaete 
larvae from entering the cage and settling on the sensors.
	Before the Data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated Data logger is 
lowered to the depth of the deployed instrument, and readings are logged at the 
same time that the deployed instruments are programmed to record.  Post-
calibration values are obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in 
standard solutions and recording the values given by the Data loggers.
	Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as 
described in the YSI Operating Manual (addendum 7/94, sections 3, 4, and 7).  
Calibration standards, required for pH turbidity and salinity, are purchased 
from a scientific supply house.  Dissolve oxygen is calibrated using a 
calibration cup filled with about 1/2 cm tap water, which creates a 100% water-
saturated air environment for the sensors when the sonde is placed in the cup.  
The sensors are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 minutes in the cup before 
DO (%Saturation) is calibrated.  Servicing the instruments results in a period 
of about 3 to 4 hours of missing data every two weeks at each site. 

5.	Site Location and Character:

	Weeks Bay (30 23' N, 87 50' W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-
estuary, located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of 
Mexico.  It is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) 
runs nearly north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to the 
mouth, where water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is 
located near the center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into 
eastern side of Weeks Bay.  Average depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas 
where depths are significantly greater.  The first is in the mouth of the bay, 
where the average depth is 6 m; the second is about 200 m upstream of the mouth 
of the Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally 
diurnal, and have a mean range of 0.4 m.
	The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 1.43 x 108 m2 and contributes 
approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow with the Magnolia River 
supplying the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 m3 s-1; although freshets up 
to 4 times larger occur throughout the year.  These characteristics result in a 
freshwater residence time of 13 days under average discharge conditions, with a 
range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay varies substantially both 
temporally and spatially.  During periods of high flow in the river, salinity in 
the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, except in the deeper holes of 
the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  However, during periods of low flow 
in the river, wind velocity and tidal stage are strong factors influencing 
salinity structure.  Salinity greater than 25 ppt is rarely observed in Weeks 
Bay and is usually restricted to the southern portion of the estuary near the 
mouth.
	Site FR (Fish River; 30 25'00" N, 87 49'24" W) is located at the mouth of 
Fish River at a mean depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there 
are small patches of Vallisineria sp. growing near (but not directly under) the 
Data logger.  Land use in the water shed is largely agricultural, with some 
residential use.  Directly surrounding the site, land use is largely public and 
semi-public.  Nutrient concentrations at this site are variable and may be quite 
high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations ranging from approximately 4-100 
然 and <0.5 to 7.5 然, respectively, over the previous 10 years (Alabama 
Department of Environmental Management).  Over the past year, salinity ranged 
from 0.0 to 16.5 ppt at this site.
	Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 22'52" N, 87 49'57" W) is located near the south-
eastern shore of the Weeks Bay, about 0.5 miles from the mouth of the estuary.  
Mean water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land 
use around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture 
occurring inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at 
site FR; over the past year, nitrate and phosphate concentrations here ranged 
from approximately 0.1 to 50 然 and 0.04 to 0.45 然, respectively.  Salinity 
ranged from approximately 0 to 22 ppt over the past year.  

6.	Data Collection Periods:

	The Data loggers were first deployed at both sites on 27 October 1995, and 
have been continuously in service since then.

10.	Data Anomalies:
Specific information: 

January 1998:	At site WB, 1/1/98 - 1/6/98, probes were very close to the 
surface during this deployment due to very low tides.  There are erratic 
readings on all probes, however, there were never out of the water.	This 
data should be viewed as surface data.	
		
At site WB, 1/15/98 - 1/29/98, pH probe would not re-calibrate at end of this 
deployment and there was some very erratic pH data for this deployment, data was 
deleted.
 
February 1998: 	At site FR, deployment ending 2/12/98, pH probe would not re-
calibrate at end of this deployment.  Data appears to be ok, but the latter part 
of this deployment may be suspect.

At site WB, 2/12/98 - 2/26/98, No pH probes would calibrate on this sonde at the 
end of this deployment.  Problem with sonde electronics, all pH data for this 
deployment was deleted.
 
March 1998:		None
		
April 1998:	At site FR, 4/9/98 - 4/23/98, pH and DO very low on post 
calibration, muddy fouling.

May 1998:	At site FR, 5/7/98 - 5/21/98, data were recorded at 00:11:50 and 
00:41:50 after the hour; reason unknown, however, data appear to be ok.  Also, 
DO was very low on post calibration, biofouling.

At site WB, 5/7/98 - 5/21/98, DO low on post calibration due to biofouling 
(mud and barnacles)
	
June 1998:	At site FR, 6/4/98 - 6/17/98, DO very erratic, many outliers all 
through the deployment, reason unknown, leaking membrane suspected, all DO for 
this deployment was deleted. 
 
At site FR, 6/17/98 - 7/2/98, DO low on post calibration due 
to biofouling.

At site WB, 6/17/98 - 7/2/98, extreme biofouling, all data is suspect for the 
latter part of this deployment.

July 1998:	At site FR, 7/2/98 - 7/15/98, some biofouling, data suspect towards 
the end of the deployment.

At site WB, 7/2/98 - 7/15/98, heavy biofouling, all data suspect during 
the latter part of this deployment, DO became abruptly erratic 7/9/98, 21:30:00 
- deleted rest of the DO data for this deployment.

At site WB, 7/15/98 - 7/25/98, extreme biofouling, (mud, worms, barnacles, 
snails... an entire benthic ecosystem!) latter part of the deployment 
compromised. On 7/21/98 at 06:00:00, DO dropped suddenly to negative values, all 
DO data after this date and time for this deployment was deleted.

August 1998:	At site FR, 8/14/98 - 8/27/98, heavy biofouling, cleaned 
probes in situ between 13:30:00 and 14:00:00 on 8/21/98, some improvement in DO 
and pH response afterwards.

At site WB, 7/29/98 - 8/14/98, extreme biofouling, latter part of the 
deployment compromised. Abrupt fall in DO on 8/4/98, at 00:00:00, negative 
readings afterwards.  All DO data after this time was deleted for this 
deployment.

At site WB, 8/14/98 - 8/27/98, probes were cleaned mid deployment but not 
re-calibrated, however, no pH probes would calibrate on this sonde at the end of 
the deployment.  All pH data was fixed at 6.4 and was deleted.  All data for 
this deployment may be suspect. 	

September 1998:	Hurricane Earl, 9/1/98 - 9/3/98.
		Hurricane Georges, 9/27/98 - 9/30/98.
At site FR, 9/24/98 - 10/8/98, pH probe was reading 6.48 in pH 10.00 standard 
buffer solution at the end of this deployment. All pH data for this deployment 
was deleted.

At site WB, 8/27/98 - 9/10/98, heavy biofouling, DO readings near 0.0 with some 
negative readings, leaking membrane suspected, All DO data deleted for this 
deployment.

At site WB, 9/10/98 - 9/24/98, biofouling very heavy this deployment, pH and 
turbidity probes would not calibrate on this sonde at the end of this 
deployment, data deleted. All data from this deployment should be suspect. 

October 1998:	At site FR, 10/8/98 - 10/22/98, Sonde electronic malfunction, 
data was not recorded.

At site WB, 10/17/98 - 10/22/98, turbidity was very high, fluctuating past 
outlier limits.  Conditions were very turbid and the turbidity probe post 
calibrated:  0.0 in 0.0 standard solution and 40.4 in 40.0 standard solution.  
It is this researchers opinion that the high values are real despite being 
outliers.

At site WB, 10/22/98 - 10/31/98, Sonde electronic malfunction, data was not 
recorded.
	
November 1998:	None

December 1998:	None

*Note:  The sonde deployed at the WB site from 7/29/98 until 10/22/98 was found 
to have been malfunctioning.  It is not known when the problem first arose and 
so all of the data during this time span from WB must be viewed with suspicion.  

General Information:
	We have deleted data only when technical difficulties resulted in 
questionable data.  Therefore, we feel that extreme caution should be used when 
evaluating these data (especially DO % sat. and concentration) because of 
problems with biofouling.  Particularly during the summer months, biofouling can 
cause severe degradation of the DO calibration over the two week deployments.  
At times the DO deviation from calibration at the end of a deployment was 
greater than 80% (in a water-saturated air environment).  We have made note of 
any data that we consider suspect because of biofouling, based on post-
calibration values reported by the sensors.  We also have provided the data that 
were taken in the field at the time of the final logging interval before 
retrieval of the deployed Data loggers, as well as the post-calibration values 
(for details see section 4, above) in section 12 (Other Remarks/Notes) below.  
We encourage anyone using the YSI data to first compare these data to these 
discrete Data logger readings and post-calibration values on the given dates 
before evaluating the data.  If the user desires, it is possible to use these 
data to correct the deployed YSI data using regression analysis.  If not, then 
the user should delete compromised data at his or her own discretion.
