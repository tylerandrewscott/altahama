2.  Entry Verification:
	The data are downloaded to an IBM compatible computer from the Hydrolab 
Datasonde I, Hydrolab Datasonde III, Hydrolab Recorder, or YSI 6000UPG as a raw 
file.  The YSI 6000 data are reviewed using the YSI computer program PC6000 that 
accompanies the YSI 6000 data logger.  After the file is uploaded from the 
datatlogger, PC6000 is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.)    The information 
obtained from this printout is used during file review to detect any gross 
outliers such as data taken when the datalogger was removed from the water or 
those caused by instrument failure.   Based on past measurements in the waters 
near Sapelo Island, it was determined that the following data should be checked:
		Salinity < 5 ppt or >35 ppt
		pH < 6.5 or > 8.5
		Temperature < 10 C or >30 C
Upon close examination of the questionable data, the data that did appear 
accurate was kept in the data set while the rest was removed and classified as 
missing data.  The edited data are formatted according to the guidelines given 
in the CDMO manual.  The data are imported into a Microsoft Excel file that 
contains the current month’s cumulative recordings.  When a complete month of 
data has been recorded the file is ready for review.  The data review includes 
several steps.  
The first step is to format the data so that the parameter columns are in the 
correct order and the data has the correct number of decimal place holders by 
using the Column Reformat CDMO Excel 5.0 Macro.   Secondly, the Date Hour Count 
CDMO Excel 5.0 macro is used to determine if there are any dates and times that 
data was not recorded due to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes.  
Missing dates and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted into 
the cells where data would normally be.  The reason for the missing data is 
recorded on the Water Quality Editing Log.  Next, the data are filtered using 
the Find Variable Outlier CDMO Excel 5.0 macro to find readings outside the 
instrument measurement range and the “normal” range for the site in question.  
Data outside the instrument range is/are removed from the file and a period is 
inserted to the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing dates and times are 
recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.  Data that was outside the “normal” 
range of water quality for a particular site is investigated for validity based 
on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument 
diagnostics.  If the data is/are rejected from the file a period is inserted to 
the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto 
the Water quality Editing Log.  The information recorded on the Water Quality 
Editing Log is transferred to the Metadata form.  The Metadata form is the 
submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Greg Schultz, reserve fellow, was 
responsible for the QA/QC of the database.   


3. Research Objectives
The purpose of research was only to perform long-term water quality 
monitoring and not a specific experiment.   Sapelo Island is only accessible by 
passenger ferry.  Due to its isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the 
SINERR show little evidence of human impact.  The Marsh Landing site receives a 
large amount of boat traffic, as it is the primary access point for the 
approximately 100 residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off 
loading.  The Barn Creek site receives moderate boat traffic, and is near a 
mechanic shop on land and several residences.  The Flume Dock site is a 
relatively isolated location compared to the other two sites.


4. Research Methods:
Water quality monitoring began at the Flume Dock and Marsh Landing sites in 
August 1986.  The Barn Creek site was added in May 1995.  Monitoring units are 
hung vertically from a float or floating dock so they hang two meters below the 
water's surface.  Hydrolab units were used exclusively until May 1995.  After 
May 1995, YSI units were used as well as the Hydrolabs. 
 
The sondes are calibrated prior to deployment following manufacturer's 
instructions. PH is calibrated  using purchased 7.00 and 10.00 pH buffers.  
Conductivity is calibrated using a solution made from KCl.  DO is calibrated by 
using current barometric pressure and % saturation and a new DO membrane is used 
for each deployment.  The probes are cleaned three times weekly while deployed 
when the warmer months increase the rate of fouling. The dissolved oxygen probes 
are cleaned once weekly with a cotton swab and soaked in methanol, while the 
other probes are cleaned with cotton swabs or pipe cleaners and de-ionized 
water.  After two weeks the units are returned to the lab for downloading, 
cleaning, and recalibration, according to the manufacturers manual.  No post 
calibration verifications were performed.  Because the sondes are deployed at a 
fixed depth, no depth data is reported.  Data were collected at 30-minute 
intervals.  

5. Site Location and Character:
The Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in a tidal 
estuary on the western side of Sapelo Island off the Georgia coast.  There are 
currently three monitoring stations, with a fourth to be added.
1)Marsh Landing -  located on the lower Duplin River at 31?21’4” N, 81?17’46” W 
near where it meets Doboy Sound.  Docking facilities for the ferry that runs to 
and from the mainland and other boats are located here.  The site is influenced 
by tidal currents from Doboy Sound and the Atlantic Ocean.  Salinity ranges from 
15 to 30 ppt.
2)Flume Dock - located on the upper Duplin River at 31?28’58”N, 81?16’3”W.  It 
is influenced by tidal currents which flood the marsh during high tide and 
recede into the river channel or its side creeks at low tide.  It receives far 
less boat traffic than Marsh Landing.  Salinity ranges from 10 to 25 ppt.
3)Barn Creek - located on a tributary of the Duplin River between the Marsh 
Landing and Flume Dock sites at 31?26’21”N, 81?16’43”W.  A small boat dock and 
several houses are located nearby.  Salinity ranges from 10 to 25 ppt.

6.  Data collection period:
Data collection began at Flume Dock on August 23, 1986, at Marsh Landing on 
August 27, 1986, and at the Barn Creek site on May 24, 1995.

7.  Associated researchers and projects:
A variety of ecological research projects are conducted in the SINERR by 
researchers associated with the University of Georgia Marine Institute.  In 
addition, the Marine Institute has conducted meteorological and hydrological 
monitoring since 1986.
