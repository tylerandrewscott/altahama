2. Entry Verification:

	The data are reviewed using the YSI computer program Ecowin 
 included with the YSI 6000/6600 data logger.  After the file is 
uploaded from the data logger, Ecowin is used to plot the data and perform basic 
statistical analyses (i.e., min., max., mean, std. dev.) The 
information obtained from this is used during file review to detect any 
gross outliers such as data taken when the data logger was removed from 
the water or those caused by instrument failure.  The data are imported into a 
Microsoft Excel file, which contains the current month's cumulative recordings.  
When a complete month of data has been recorded the file is ready for review.  
The data review includes several steps.  The first step is to format the data 
using the Excel macros provided by CDMO. The CDMO macros will allow the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro 
will allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel 
file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In 
addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro 
allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis.  Secondly, the Excel macro is used to determine if there 
are any dates and times that data was not recorded due to maintenance, 
battery failure, or other causes.  Missing dates and times are inserted 
into the file and a period is inserted into the cells where data would 
normally be.  The reason for the missing data is recorded on the 
metadata document. 
Data that was outside the "normal" range of water quality for a 
particular site is investigated for validity based on weather data, 
field observations, QC checks, PC6000 printouts, and instrument 
diagnostics.  If the data is/are rejected from the file a period is 
inserted to the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates and 
times are recorded onto metadata document. The completed metadata form 
is then submitted with the data file to the CDMO.  Jane Garbisch was 
responsible for all 2001 data collection and management.  

3. Research Objectives:
Hydrological studies (Ragotskie and Bryson, 1955: Imberger et al., 
1983) have shown that there are three tidal excursions along the length 
of the Duplin River, resulting in three distinct water masses.  The two 
monitoring sites in the Duplin River, called the Lower Duplin site and the Hunt 
Camp site, are located within the lower and upper water masses, respectively.  
Water passing the Lower Duplin site during flood tide has come from Doboy Sound, 
which receives input from the Altamaha River via the Intra-Coastal Waterway and 
from the Atlantic Ocean.  The water in the lower water mass is pushed further up 
the Duplin or up smaller tidal creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh 
surface by the flood tide and recedes into the main channel during ebb 
tide.  The water in the upper water mass, which passes the Hunt Camp 
station, is pushed up small creek channels and onto the marsh at each 
high tide.  Thus the two stations monitor conditions in two hydrological 
separate water masses, one of which is heavily influenced by exchanges with 
Doboy Sound and the other, which is influenced by its twice-daily contact with 
the marsh surface.  
	Sapelo Island is only accessible by passenger ferry.  Due to its 
isolation, the salt marsh and tidal waters of the SAP NERR show relatively 
little evidence of human impact.  Thus the Marsh Landing dock, where the Lower 
Duplin (LD) site is located, the primary access point for the approximately 200-
300 residents, commuters and daily visitors plus barge off loading was chosen as 
the most directly impacted site.  The Lower Duplin site is also readily 
accessible and centrally located within the SAP NERR.  The University of Georgia 
Marine Institute has used this as a monitoring site for years and SAP NERR 
continues to do so.  The Hunt Dock (HD) site was selected in July 1999 for 
monitoring.  It is a dock only used for transporting hunters during the fall 
season.  It is further up the Duplin, where the primary usage of the river is 
for pleasure boating and crabbing.  Therefore it is considered the least 
impacted site.  The University of Georgia-Athens continues to monitor further up 
the Duplin and the Flume Dock site.

4.   Research Methods:

	The SAP NERR Water Quality Monitoring began in October of 1999, at 
the Marsh Landing Dock on the lower Duplin River.  At this time we are 
only performing long term water quality monitoring and not a specific 
experiment.  Prior to April 15, 1999 sampling was completed by the 
University of Georgia-Athens Marine Institute(UGAMI). When SAP NERR 
took over the NERR monitoring from the University of GA, a second site 
was set up at the Marsh Landing site to be the NERR monitoring station.  
In order to lesson the confusion between the 2 sites, the SAP NERR site 
is referred to as the Lower Duplin site (LD) and is monitored at a 
fixed depth from the bottom (0.5m).  The University continues to 
monitor at a fixed depth just below the surface (Marsh Landing) but 
this site is no longer considered a NERR monitoring station.  The Flume 
Dock (FD)is also monitored by the University; but, data is no longer 
reported to the SAP NERR. Therefore the Hunt Dock (HD) site was 
established just south of the Flume Dock site as the new upper Duplin 
site and also measures at 0.5m above the surface bottom.  

	Before each YSI PC6000 data logger is deployed, calibration and 
maintenance is performed following the manufacturer's instructions.  
Calibration standards are only required for pH, conductivity, and 
turbidity, all other parameters are done as described in the manual.  
Buffer solutions for 2-point calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased 
from a scientific supply house.  The conductivity standard is made 
using a 0.2 M solution of KCl (24.82mS/cm = 14.92 g/L) or from serial 
dilution of a certified conductivity standard.  The turbidity 
calibration uses distilled water made by the University of Georgia-
Athens Marine Institute and a purchased 100 NTU certified standard.  
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are 
allowed to sit at least 24 hours prior to deployment.  Calibration is 
then verified by running a standard as a sample after each calibration. 

	When deployed the weather conditions and tidal stage are recorded 
in the field observation log. The data logger is placed inside a length 
of PVC pipe attached to the dock.  The Lower Duplin data logger is 
attached to the north side of a non-floating dock by a steal cable and 
run down a PVC pipe to rest 0.5m above the surface bottom.  The Hunt 
Dock data logger is attached to the south side of a fixed dock by steel 
cable and run down a PVC pipe to take measurements 0.5m above the 
surface bottom. Because of the large tidal range, water is continually 
flushed through the pvc pipes, thus eliminating the problem 
of creating a stagnate column of water within the pipe with data 
logger. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period, measurements are taken for 
temperature, specific conductance, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen 
concentration, percent saturation, depth and turbidity.

	During the stage of deployment the data logger is checked for 
fouling and cleaned.  This can be one to three times a week depending 
on the time of year.  
At the end of the sample period the data logger is retrieved and 
immediately replaced by another calibrated data logger.  The data 
logger is then taken to the lab and runs QA/QC standards for pH, and 
conductivity, and dissolved oxygen, the data is uploaded, and the sonde 
is cleaned.  Data is removed if the post calibration standards fail or 
if technical problems are noted.  All data removed is noted for the 
metadata.


5.  Site Location and character:
	
	The monitoring site is located on the Marsh Landing Dock in the 
Duplin River on Sapelo Island.  Water passing the Marsh Landing site 
during flood tide originates from the Doboy Sound.  The Doboy receives 
input from the Atlantic Ocean, and the Altamaha River via the Intra-
Coastal Waterway. The water is pushed up the river or up smaller tidal 
creeks and some is pushed onto the marsh surface by the flood tide and 
recedes into the main channel during ebb tide.
	The dock itself is used as the main dock to the island where the 
ferry makes several daily runs.  There are also several small boats 
that are docked there.  The surrounding area vegetation is dominated by 
salt marsh with Spartina being the predominate flora. Latitude and 
longitude for Lower Duplin site is as follows:  31 deg 25' 4" N, 81 deg 
17' 46" W); Latitude and longitude for Hunt Dock site is as follows: 
(31 deg 28' 43", 81 deg 16' 23" W); Tidal range maximum for both sites 
is 14 feet and the salinity range is 5-35 ppt. 


	The Hunt Dock monitoring site is located on the Duplin River, off 
of Moses Hammock, which is separated by Sapelo Island by a small tidal 
channel.  The primary runoff at the site is from tidal creeks flowing 
through Spartina marsh and through the mud. There is little human 
traffic this far up the Duplin and it is north of the people living on 
Sapelo. During the fall, the Hunt dock and Moses Hammock are the 
camping and docking site for deer hunters traveling to the island.  
These are controlled hunts and dates are available from the SAP NERR 
office if needed.

8.  Associated researchers and projects:

Sapelo Island has a long history of maintaining research.  In 1953, the 
University of Georgia Marine Institute (UGAMI) was formed and the 
island became a working laboratory for many.  The research continues 
today with SAP NERR and UGAMI creating a unique partnership with much of 
the current research being facilitated by SAP NERR and UGAMI 
together.  Given UGAMI's long history on Sapelo, a bibliographic list 
of over 800 articles of current and previous research can be found on 
the UGAMI website.  (http://www.uga.edu/UGAMI).

April
4/22/2001 21:00 -5/13/2001 14:30 DO% and DO mg/L data removed due to post 
deployment calibration verification failure
Turbidity spikes, data retained: 
04/12/2001 22:00 373 NTU, cause unknown
No turbidity probe deployed 04/22/2001 19:00 - 04/30/2001 23:30, therefore no 
turbidity data is available. 
The following times had all data removed due to exposure above the 
water's surface during low tide:

May/June
5/27/2001 18:30 - 06/06/2001 13:00 DO% and mg/L were removed after 
post-deployment calibration verification failed. It was at 18:30 where 
a large DO spike occurred, possibly from membrane failure.
No turbidity probe deployed for the month of May, therefore no turbidity data is 
available. 
No turbidity probe deployed 06/01/2001 00:00 - 06/06/2001 13:30, therefore no 
turbidity data is available. 
No turbidity probe deployed 06/24/2001 12:30 - 06/30/2001 23:30, therefore no 
turbidity data is available. 
06/24/2001 12:30 - 06/30 23:30 DO% and mg/L were deleted due to probe failure.
The following times had all data removed due to exposure above the 
water's surface during low tide:

July
07/01/2001 00:00 - 07/16/2001 16:30 DO% and mg/L were removed after 
post-deployment calibration verification failed.
No turbidity probe deployed 07/01/2001 00:00 - 07/31/2001 23:30, therefore no 
turbidity data is available. 
The following data for DO% is unusually high, the data is kept in the 
data set because post calibration verification passed within acceptable 
limits.  The cause of this increase in DO is unknown.

07/16/2001 17:00 note increase in salinity and pH.  This point is where 
the sondes were switched. The increase is most likely due to clean 
probes put out compared to the sonde that has been deployed for some time.
The following times had all data removed due to exposure above the water's 
surface during low tide:

October
No turbidity probe deployed 10/01/2001 00:00 - 10/31/2001 23:30, therefore no 
turbidity data is available. 
10/15/2001 14:30 DO read a negative value, cause unknown.
10/15/2001 14:30 - 10/23 14:00 DO% and mg/L were deleted due to possible 
membrane puncture. The DO probe reported a negative value on 10/15/2001 14:30, 
which may have been the beginning of membrane failure. Sonde battery read 10.5 
volts during this time, ruling out complete battery failure. 
The following times had all data removed due to exposure above the 
water's surface during low tide:

November
No turbidity probe deployed 11/01/2001 00:00 - 11/30/2001 23:30, therefore no 
turbidity data is available. 
11/18/2001 10:00 - 11/22/2001 9:00 DO once again is reading higher than 
typical for this site.  Cause unknown. sonde had technical failure during mid 
deployment so it was not possible to monitor the end of this DO event, and 
because of battery failure, post calibration QA/QC was not run, therefore this 
data is highly suspect.


December
No turbidity probe deployed 12/01/2001 00:00 - 12/31/2001 23:30, therefore no

July
7/14/2001 11:00 all data missing, sonde not deployed.
7/19/2001 13:00 all data removed, sonde exposed during low tide.
7/19/2001 17:00 High turbidity value recorded (845 NTU) due to possible presence 
of debris. Value retained. 
7/20/2001 13:30 -14:00 all data removed, sonde exposed during low tide.
7/20/2001 22:00 High turbidity value recorded (946 NTU) due to possible presence 
of debris. Value retained. 

August
8/2/2001 13:30 -8/16/2001 15:00 turbidity data removed, post calibration 
verification failed.
8/16/2001 15:30 - 9/2/2001 11:30 all data removed because the sonde became hung 
up in the pvc pipe during deployment, this made the depth values off and the 
sonde regularly exposed during tide fluctuations.  
Sonde also shorted out when pulled out from the pipe and stopped collecting 
data.  Therefore, none of the data collected is reliable.
8/16/2001 15:30 - 12/31/2001 no turbidity probe deployed.

September
9/19/2001 12:30 no data, sonde did not record data during this time 
period.  The cause for this programming problem is unknown.
9/2/2001 12:00 - 9/23/2001 14:30 DO% and mg/L data removed.  DO data 
often reading negative but did pass post calibration verification. The 
data was removed because at a later deployment this same probe was found to need 
reconditioning.
For the following times, all data were deleted due to sonde being exposed at low 
tides:
9/17/2001 02:00 - 02:30
9/17/2001 14:00 - 15:30
9/18/2001 02:30 - 03:30

9/20/2001 17:00 - 17:30
9/21/2001 05:00 - 06:00
9/23/2001 16:00 no data reported, sonde not deployed.

October
10/16/2001 15:00 all data missing, sonde not deployed
10/16/2001 15:30-11/2/2001 17:30 DO% and mg/L data removed due to post 
calibration verification failure. Probe required reconditioning.

November
11/25/2001 17:30 - 12/12/2001 14:30 Turbidity data removed, unable to calibrate 
properly before deployment but sonde still collected the data.
11/25/2001 10:00-11/25/2001 16:30 All data missing. Sonde not deployed

December
12/12/2001 15:00 - 12/31/2001 all data missing sonde malfunctioned and had to be 
sent in for repairs, all data lost.



12. Missing Data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post problems.  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11).  To find out more details bout missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other remarks:

During the month of February the hunt dock site had extreme low tides due to the 
right combination of tide and strong winds. 

Coastal Georgia has been stricken with drought, and the year 2001 brought no 
relief.  There was very little rainfall, and no large tropical disturbances.
