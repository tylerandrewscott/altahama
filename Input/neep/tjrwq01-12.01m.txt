2.  Entry Verification:

The data are uploaded directly from the YSI model 6000 or 6600 dataloggers to 
the YSI Ecowatch for windows software into a file appended with the suffix 
".dat". The data are also downloaded directly from the datalogger into a 
spreadsheet importable file appended with the suffix ".csv". The data are then 
reviewed for major problems (i.e. logger out of water, probe malfunction, 
battery failure, etc.) using the YSI Ecowatch for windows plotting software.  
The resulting plot is printed out and saved in a folder named "datalogger 
deployment log".  The .csv file is imported into Excel 2000 for Windows, where 
it is edited and formatted.

The tails of each sampling period are deleted and any suspect data are 
identified with the aid of Excel CDMO 5.0 macros.  Suspect data are evaluated 
and dealt with according to CDMO Operations Manual (ver.4.0)guidelines.  The 
parameter columns are checked for proper order and correct heading labels and 
formatted to the correct decimal places using the "column reformat" macro 
supplied by the CDMO.  Missing data fields are inserted into the Excel 
spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Reasons for any missing or 
anomalous data are entered directly into the data file and the edited file is 
saved as a two-week excel file.  When an entire month of two-week edited data 
files have been collected, the files are edited and combined into a 1 month 
excel file using the excel import.xls macro. All editing and missing data 
documentation are also recorded in an excel file named "missing data log".  The 
information in the "missing data log" is transferred to the metadata form. The 
edited and raw files are archived on a Sun Sparc 20 workstation and backed up to 
tape weekly.  Data and metadata files are uploaded via ftp to the CDMO. The 
person responsible for the data management is Michelle Cordrey.


3.  Research Objectives:

	The Tijuana Estuarine Research Reserve is impacted heavily by both
periodic raw sewage outflows and urban development. Only about a quarter of
the reserve's 2,531 acres are tidally influenced, with few channels deep
enough for datalogger deployment.  Two stations were originally set up:  a
treatment station was set up close to the mouth on the Southern end of
the Oneonta Slough, while a control station was set up on the northern
end of Oneonta Slough.  The treatment station location was chosen because
it would be the site most affected by sewage outflow. Deployment at the
treatment station, however, was continually halted by both shifting
sediment and massive wracks of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), which would
often bury the deployment set-up on incoming tides.  After a number of
different deployment equipment designs were implemented, with no success,
logging at this site was terminated.

	We currently have two YSI datalogger stations installed at the reserve.  
The original control station in the northern end of Oneonta Slough is still
in place.  A second datalogger station is located at the inlet to the Model 
Marsh, a recently-constructeed 20-acre restoration site in the southern arm of 
the estuary.  The Model Marsh was opened to tidal flushing in February 2000.  
Installation of the restoration site will allow us to make comparisons 
between constructed and natural site hydrology over time.


4.  Research Methods (Dataloggers):

At all the sampling stations until October 2000, all deployment stations were 
identical. A 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was strapped to two 6 foot lengths of 4in 
diameter aluminum pipe driven into the sediment in the center of the channel 
until refusal. 

The bottom of the pvc pipe is raised 1 foot off of the channel bottom and is 
open.  Multiple 1.5 inch holes have been drilled around the bottom of the tube 
to permit unrestricted water flow to the sensors.  During deployment the 
datalogger units are then placed into and rest on a bolt fixed across the bottom 
of the tubes.

Beginning on October 16, 2000 at the Oneonta Slough station and on October 25, 
2000 at the Model Marsh station a 5 inch diameter PVC pipe was strapped to a 4 
inch diameter aluminum pipe driven into the sediment in the center of the 
channel until refusal.   A "snorkel" tube is also strapped to the 4 inch 
diameter aluminum pipe to allow for the shallow level vented sensor on the YSI 
model 6600 sondes to compensate for barometric changes in the atmosphere. 
The sampling period is two weeks, with measurements taken every 30 minutes.  
Measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (percent 
saturation), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), temperature, turbidity and water level are 
recorded.  At the end of each two week period, the YSI data logger units are 
brought back to the laboratory for downloading, cleaning and recalibration and 
are usually redeployed in the field within 24 to 48 hours. These procedures are 
carried out according to the methods described in the YSI Operations Manual (see 
sections 3 and 7). Calibration standards for specific conductivity are purchased 
from YSI and pH and turbidity are purchased pre-made from VWR scientific.  The 
QA/QC procedures for the collected data are followed as given in the CDMO 
Operations Manual version 4.0.

Logging began on October 25, 2000 at the Model Marsh station.
Logging began in February 1996at the Oneonta Slough station.


5.  Site location and character:

General site Characteristics (TJE)
a) Tidal exchange (extremes): approx. -2 +7 MLLW,
b) Salinity: 4 ppt (extreme rain events) to 38 ppt
d) Latitude and longitude:  32 deg. 34 min. N, 117 deg. 07 min. W 
c) Potential impacts: storm drain runoff from military airfield and adjacent 
residential areas, occasional sewage spills (10-15 MGD) into the Tijuana River from Mexico.  
The area surrounding the estuary is heavily developed by residential housing as is the 
watershed which drains into the estuary.  Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico.  
The North Eastern section of the reserve is bordered by a military helicopter training 
base.  Vegetation in the area is dominated by common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) 
and Pacific cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).

Specific Site characteristics: Oneonta Slough (OS)
a) Orientation of site:  The Datalogger station is located on the upper portion 
of Oneonta Slough.  The channel runs North to South and is located on the 
northwestern edge of the reserve. Latitude is 32 deg  34 min 04.8 sec N, 
longitude is 117 deg 07 min 52.3 sec W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom directly below the datalogger is approx. 
0.55m below Mean Sea Level.
c) Channel width is approx. 20 meters.  Datalogger site is located 1km from 
mouth
d) Bottom type: sand and sediment
e) Area adjacent to west side of channel is developed. There is a 50-meter 
buffer of natural vegetation between development and the channel.  Area adjacent 
to east side of channel is relatively natural.
f) Direct impacts are estimated to be runoff from streets into channel during 
rain events.

Specific Site Characteristics:  Model Marsh (MM)
a) Orientation of site: The datalogger station is located in the middle of a 
natural channel which runs north to south.  The channel is approximately 20 
meters north of a newly constructed 20 acre mudflat restoration area in
the southern section or the reserve.  The latitude of the site is 32 deg 32 min 
52.05 sec N, the longitude is 117 deg 07 min 22.9 sec W
b) The elevation of the channel bottom: -.39 NGVD
c) Channel width: 5 meters
d) Bottom type:  Mostly mud with some sand

a) 02/01/2001 14:00:00 - 02/15/2001 15:30:00, Time values were offset by + 40 
sec.  Data were corrected to nearest 00:00 or 00:30 minute interval.
b) 02/07/2001 05:30:00 - 02/15/2001 15:30:00, specific conductivity and salinity 
values unusually low.  Likely correlated to rain event beginning on 02/07/01.  
Data were not removed.
c) 02/07/2001 05:30:00 - 02/15/2001 15:30:00, DO% and DOmg/L values unusually 
low.  Probably due to rain event beginning on 02/07/01.  Data were not removed.
d) The following anomalously high turbidity values were recorded.  A probable 
cause for these values was not found so data were not removed.

a) 08/19/2001 16:30:00 - 08/19/2001 18:30:00, pH anomalously low. Depth was 
zero, so datalogger was measuring pH of the surface water.
b) 08/24/2001 11:30:00 - 08/31/2001 23:30:00, Time values were offset by + 40

b) 11/24/2001 23:00:00 - 11/27/2001 14:00:00, turbidity missing. Average values 
well above normal turbidity readings even when taking into consideration the 
rainfall event which occurred 11/24/01.  Data were removed.
c) On the following dates and times slightly negative depth values were 
recorded.  Data were not removed.

d) The following anomalously high turbidity values were recorded.  A probable 
cause for these values was not found so data were not removed.
Date	Time	Turbidity
11/14/2001	17:00:00	0337
11/15/2001	21:30:00	0678
e) 11/24/01 23:00:00 - 11/27/01 14:00:00, salinity values unusually low.  
Likely caused by rain event.  Data were not removed.  
f) Do starts to decline on 11/24/02 23:00:00 and stays at 0.5 mg/L for 12 hours, 
then slowly recovers. The low DO occurred following a rainfall event. Data were 
retained.

sec.  Data were corrected to nearest 00:00 or 00:30 minute interval.
b) 11/22 through 12/12, minimum water depth is higher than usual during this 
time, perhaps due to possible sedimentation at the mouth of the slough, however there 
is no ancillary data to back this up.  
c) The following anomalously high turbidity values were recorded.  A probable 
cause for these values was not found so data were not removed.

12. Missing Data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.    


13. Post deployment information:

np = no probe installed
nc = no calibration done
