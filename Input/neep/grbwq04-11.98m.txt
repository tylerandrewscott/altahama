2. Entry verification
The data are transmitted every thirty minutes from YSI 6000 datasondes via VHF 
packet
radio using Ecowatch software to an Acer computer. Files are first examined and
graphed using Ecowatch software.  Missing and/or anomalous data are noted. Files
are then transferred to a Macintosh computer and opened in Excel 5.0 software 
and
edited. Missing data due to routine YSI maintenance and probe failure or
communication errors are inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods 
(.).
Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data.  Files are verified 
by
means of CDMO Excel 5.0 macros. 

3. Research Objectives
In 1998, YSI 6000 datasondes were deployed in Great Bay and in the
Squamscott and Lamprey Rivers part of the National Estuarine Research
Reserves' (NERRS) Systemwide Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to
develop and maintain temporally intensive long-term datasets of
physio-chemical parameters of water quality at locations that are
representative of the Great Bay Estuarine System. The Great Bay site is
relatively unimpacted, while the two tidal river sites (Lamprey and
Squamscott) have large drainage basins and are impacted by both point
(wastewater treatment plants) and nonpoint sources of pollution.  In
addition to establishing a baseline of water quality, the data is used by a
number of researchers in the analysis of physical and biological processes.

4. Research Methods
Datasondes are programmed to obtain measurements of specific conductivity,
salinity, dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, pH, temperature, water
level and turbidity every half hour. The instruments are deployed
continuously during ice-free seasons, except for brief periods when they
are removed for cleaning, maintenance and recalibration. Pre and
post-deployment calibrations are performed using the diagnostics menu of
the YSI Ecowatch program and QA/QC procedures developed by NERR Research
Coordinators and YSI engineers. VWR conductivity and pH standards are used
for calibration. Hach formazin is used to calibrate turbidity probes.
Due to the addition of telemetry for remote data acquisition in 1998, the
method of deployment of the YSI datasondes changed part way through the
year.  Initially, sondes were attached to fixed moorings at the Great Bay
and Squamscott River stations at distance of one meter from the bottom and
were set to record in unattended mode.  In May 1988, an additional sonde
was deployed at the Great Bay site in a YSI EM 550 buoy equipped with
packet radio telemetry.  Data from the buoy-deployed sonde was transmitted
in real-time to a base station computer at Jackson Estuarine Laboratory.
The anchored sonde was also maintained at the Great Bay site for
approximately two months in order to compare water quality data collected
one meter above the bottom (anchored sonde) and one meter below the surface
(buoy deployed sonde).  The anchored sonde was also used to obtain water
level data.  Analysis of the data from the two sondes at the Great Bay
station indicated a high degree of vertical mixing in the water column and
no differences in any of the measured parameters.  Water level data from
the Great Bay anchored sonde was also used in conjunction with water level
data from the Squamscott River to enable us to adjust the time, tide height
and depth at the Squamscott to create an accurate tidal signal for the
Great Bay buoy.  This analysis indicated that the water level data from the
Squamscott station could be adjusted and substituted for additional
anchored sonde data at the Great Bay buoy station.
In July 1998, the Squamscott River sonde deployment was changed from fixed
anchor deployment to a fixed piling deployment several hundred yards
downstream from the original location.  The sonde was placed inside a PVC
pipe attached to a bridge piling and hard wired to a 1240 radio
transmitter.  The sonde was deployed for the remainder of the season in SDI
12 mode and data was transmitted in real-time to the base station computer
at Jackson Lab.   YSI In October 1998, a third station was established in
the Lamprey River.  Deployment strategy for this station is identical to
that described for the Squamscott River (telemetered, piling mounted,
etc.). Ecowatch software is used for communications and data transmission
from the three telemetered sites.
In November 1998, one sonde was upgraded to accommodate a turbidity probe
and turbidity data was collected at the Great Bay site during November and
December 1998.


5. Site Location and Character

Site #1 Great Bay  (GB)
Location
Central area of Great Bay proper.  The coordinates of the deployment are 
43š04¹20²
latitude and 70š52¹10² longitude.
Salinity range: 5-32 ppt (seasonally); 0-5ppt from high to low tide.
Temperature range: -1šC to 24šC (seasonally); 0-3š from high to low tide
Depth: 6.5 meters at MLW
Tidal height of 2.7 meters
Bottom type: Mud and rock channel bottom
Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Squamscott, Lamprey and Winnicut Rivers plus smaller streams. High
tide influence from Little Bay and associated rivers
Pollutant influence: clean reference site

Deployment
The instrument is attached to an EM 550 communications buoy equipped with a YSI
1240 VHF radio transmitter.  The instrument is configured with the probes held 
at a
depth of 1 meter below the surface.  Tidal signal is obtained using an additional 
sonde
attached to a fixed mooring at a height of approximately 1.5m above the bottom.

Site #2 Squamscott River (SQ)
Location
Mid channel of the Squamscott River at the Boston and Maine Railroad bridge,
Stratham, NH.
Coordinates are 43š02¹30² latitude and 70š55¹20² longitude
Salinity range: 0-30ppt (seasonally); 5-20 ppt from high to low tide
Temperature range: -1šC to 27šC (seasonally); 0-5š from high to low tide
Depth: 3.5 meters at MLW
Tidal height of 2.7 m
Bottom type: Mud channel bottom
Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Exeter River, adjacent marshes
Pollutant influence: Urban stormwater, agriculture, two municipal wastewater
treatment plants, residential septic systems

Deployment
The sonde is deployed in a perforated PVC cylinder attached to a piling at a 
fixed
0.5m height above the bottom and connected to a YSI 1240 radio transmitter
mounted on the piling.

Site #3 Lamprey River (LR)
Location 
West bank of the tidal portion of the Lamprey River, aproximately 300 m
downstream of the dam at Route 108 in Newmarket, NH
Coordinates are 43š04'48" latitude and 70š56'04" longitude
Salinity range 0 to 27 (seasonally); difference of up to 15 ppt between high
and low tides
Temperature range -1šC to 27 (seasonally); difference of up to 5šC between
high and low tides
Depth: 3.5 m
Tidal height 2.7 m
Bottom type: mud/rock
Tidal velocity: maximum 40 cm/sec
Watershed: Lamprey River
Pollutant influence:  Urban stormwater, adjacent marina, upstream and
downstream wastewater treatment plants, upstream agriculture

Deployment
The sonde is deployed in a perforated PVC cylinder attached to a piling at
a fixed height of 0.5 m above the bottom. The data was collected in unattended 
mode
because we could not receive radio transmission at this site.

6.  Data collection period
Great Bay data collection began April 15, 1998.  Squamscott River data 
collection
began April 23, 1998.  Lamprey River data collection began Oct. 14, 1998.  The
instruments are removed from the water during the winter months due to icing.

9.  Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions:
Site definitions: GB = Great Bay, SQ = Squamscott River, LR=Lamprey River

Note on missing depth data at GB:  When the GB sonde is deployed on a buoy it
does not take accurate depth readings because it is floating with the tide.  For 
these
data sets, we used Squamscott depth data adjusted for timing and difference in 
site
depths.  GB missing depth data is a result of a lack of corresponding SQ depth 
data
for those time periods. (Because SQ sonde was in the lab during that period.)
