2.	Entry verification:
	The data are directly downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 sonde to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat). The comma-delimited files are 
imported into Excel 97 where they are formatted and processed by macros that are 
supplied by the CDMO. Various macros are designed to: 1) check data files for 
missing data points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods 
(.), 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and 
numeric variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the 
data logger's sensors and output the anomalous data to a file (*.dat), and 5) 
save the files as Excel worksheets (*.xls).
	The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete 
the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range 
expected for the site, 2) outside the range of measurements established for the 
sensors, 3) outside the range of accuracy established for the sensors, or 4) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved 
oxygen <28%).  Data are deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor 
malfunction, 2) exposure of sensors during low tide, or 3) fouling of sensors by 
aquatic organisms, debris, or sediment.  Sensor malfunctions are detected if the 
voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the sensor or 
the sensor will not calibrate.  Fouling of sensors is detected by comparing in-
situ sensor readings with measurements (see Research Methods section).  In 
addition, sensor readings that differ significantly (>10%) from standard 
solution (i.e., conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during 
deployment.  After corrections are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the 
files are exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt) to the CDMO.  Saundra 
Upchurch and Amy Whitaker are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
	Based on discussions with local CZM personnel and our knowledge of land 
use within the Reserve, the South Edisto River drainage basin appears well 
suited for studying contrasting hydrographic conditions and land use patterns.  
One NERR water quality monitoring station has been established near Edisto Beach 
within a tributary of Big Bay Creek.  Surrounded by residential and commercial 
development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is designated 
as the "treatment" site.  The second NERR water quality monitoring station has 
been situated near Bailey Island, within a tributary of St. Pierre Creek.  Urban 
development in the immediate area of this station has been sparse to date so 
this station will serve as our "control" site.
The ACE Basin water quality monitoring program began on March 3, 1995 at two 
tributaries off Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks (see Site Location and Character 
section for description of sites).  The deployment sites were constructed prior 
to the first deployment (see Research Methods section).  Initially, the YSI 
electronic data loggers were programmed to measure the water temperature, 
specific conductance, dissolved oxygen and water level, and pH at 15-minute 
intervals (sampling interval was changed to 30 minutes prior to the August 11 
deployment period).  Starting April 11, 1996 deployment period, turbidity 
monitoring was added to the program. Beginning in December of 1999, we alternate 
between chlorophyll a and turbidity data collection, and each parameter is 
monitored two weeks each month. (Note: chlorophyll data are not yet a parameter 
that is collected for the NERR system, so please contact the Research 
Coordinator and/or Reserve Technician for this data.)  In July 1997, the Reserve 
staff initiated 
nutrient monitoring study.  The objective of the study is to ascertain the 
annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient levels near our two data logger sites.  
Nutrient levels are measured during a complete tidal cycle each month, and the 
samples are analyzed for ammonia, nitrite-nitrate, ortho-phosphate, and 
chlorophyll a concentrations.
In December of 1999, we initiated a Chlorophyll Testing Pilot Study.  The 
objective of the study is to test the performance and accuracy of the 
fluorescence probes by comparison of automated data sets with field and/or lab 
measurements of total chlorophyll, as determined by standard laboratory methods.  
The electronics package in two 6000 dataloggers were upgraded so 
that the existing optical ports could be used for turbidity and chlorophyll 
measurements.  We started measuring chlorophyll data at both sites on February 
11, 2000.  Water samples are collected at the beginning and end of each 
deployment and analyzed for chlorophyll, using the 
fluorometric method.  The study was completed in June 7, 2000.


4.	Research Methods
	One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in the 
South Edisto River watershed.  The monitoring station at Big Bay Creek was 
constructed in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted vertically on 12-foot 
galvanized pole.  To facilitate water flow across the sensors, approximately 
two-inch diameter holes were drilled into the PVC pipes.  The pipes are 
also positioned to ensure that the sensors are approximately 0.1 meters from the 
creek bottom.  In 1997, the St. Pierre Creek station was modified: the PVC pipe 
was mounted horizontally in a pyramid-shaped cage (2.5 ft long x 1.5 ft high) 
tethered to the original 12-foot galvanized pole.  Later that year, we began to 
put the data loggers in 1/8-inch mesh net bags before placing them in the PVC 
pipe to reduce damage by crabs and fish.  In April 2000 the St. Pierre station 
was moved and modified.  The station was moved to the other side of the creek, 
and the pyramid-shaped cage was deployed vertically at the base of the pole.  
During the summer, the data loggers are deployed at the sites for one to two 
weeks, and the sampling period is extended to one month during the cooler 
months.
	At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are brought back to 
the laboratory for cleaning, calibration, and servicing, by methods outlined in 
the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  Downtime for doing these procedures 
normally ranges from 24 to 48 hours.  After cleaning the data loggers, the 
dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and is allowed to stretch for 24 
hours before calibration begins.  The pH, conductivity, depth, and turbidity 
sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 and 10, conductivity 
standard of 58.64 mS/cm, depth in the air, and turbidity standards of 0 and 200 
NTU, respectively.  The water level sensor is zeroed in air, and the chlorophyll 
is zeroed in distilled water.  The DO sensor is calibrated in air-saturated 
water.  In addition to the procedures outlined in the manual, we conduct a DO 
membrane integrity test prior to deployment to determine if the membrane was 
damaged during calibration.	Several quality assurance checks are used to 
determine if the sensor readings drifted significantly during deployment. In-
situ measurements of dissolved oxygen, expressed in mg/L, salinity, and water 
temperature are taken during the first and last sampling interval.  Water 
samples are collected at the same depth as the sensors.  Water temperature and 
salinity are measured directly with a thermistor and refractometer, 
respectively, and dissolved oxygen level is determined by the Winkler procedure.  
Post-deployment measurements of all the parameters are taken before cleaning the 
data loggers.  Sensors are immersed in the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., 
pH) and readings are recorded. A DO membrane integrity test also is conducted to 
determine if the membrane was damaged during deployment.  The results of these 
checks are used to evaluate the validity of the data (see Entry Verification 
section). 

5.	Site Location and Character:
	The two sampling sites are in separate tributaries of the South Edisto 
River. The descriptions of the sites are as follows:
Station A (bb)- this site is in a tidal marsh creek off Big Bay Creek (GPS 
coordinates: 32'29"38.72125N and 80'19"21.69864W). Surrounded by residential and 
commercial development and subject to nonpoint source pollution, this station is 
designated as the "treatment" site. Pollution sources to Big Bay Creek include 
houses bordering the creek, many of them with little setbacks from the bordering 
Spartina marsh; forty docks in the area constructed of creosote, concrete and 
Wolmanized pilings; boat dockage and heavy boat traffic through the creek; a 
paved road and three boat ramps off the creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA 
treated bulkheads and fueling areas located about 0.5 miles downstream; two 
commercial seafood docks with 8-10 commercial shrimp boats; and three 
restaurants. The creek is closed to shellfish harvesting because of  the 
human development in the vicinity. Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh 
dominated by Spartina alterniflora with isolated areas of Salicornia. Upland 
fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oak and cedars. Reefs of American 
oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fringe the creek banks. At the time of 
reconnaissance, depth of the creek midway through ebb tide was 5 feet and 
salinity was 23 parts per thousand (ppt). Station B (sp) - this site is in a 
tidal creek off St. Pierre Creek (GPS coordinates: 32'31"40.59518N and 80' 
21"41.25481W). The tidal creek and St. Pierre Creek are surrounded by a wide 
expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh. Extensive mud flats and oyster reefs 
fringe the banks.  Maritime forest communities comprised of species such as wax 
myrtles, live oaks, and palmettos dominate the upland areas.  Development in the 
immediate area is sparse. This creek is subject to relatively light boat 
traffic. At the time of reconnaissance, depth at low tide was 2.5 feet and 
salinity was 21 ppt. 
	The following discussions of trends in water quality at the monitoring 
stations are based on data collected from March 1995 through December 1997.  
During this period, water temperature at both monitoring sites exhibited a 
seasonal pattern with lowest values occurring in December-January.  The lowest 
monthly water temperature observed was 8.9 oC, which occurred in February 
1996 at St. Pierre Creek; whereas maximum temperatures occurred in July and 
August with the highest monthly water temperature 38.9 oC occurring in July 1995 
at Big Bay Creek.  Diurnal variation in temperature was evident with warmest 
temperatures occurring from 1300 hr to 1800 hr at both sites.  Salinity also 
exhibited seasonal variability during the same period, with lowest values 
occurring in March at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks.  Another period of low 
average monthly salinity occurred at Big Bay Creek in December 1997.  Average 
annual salinity for both sites was in the polyhaline regime, with a mean of 29.4 
‰ at Big Bay Creek and 26.3‰ at St. Pierre Creek; however, for all years, 
salinity ranged from 0.3-41.7 ‰ at Big Bay and from 0-41.7‰ at St. Pierre Creek.  
Local precipitation and evaporation conditions are most likely the major 
contributors to monthly variability in salinity.  Analysis of the data indicates 
that tidal stage strongly influences salinity.  As expected, highest values of 
salinity occurred on the flood tide. 
	It appears that tidal stage also influences pH. Spectral analysis revealed 
a periodicity for pH and water depth with a sinusoidal period at ~ 12 hrs, 
representing tidal periodicity.  Time series plots of pH indicated variability 
of ~1 standard unit (su) on a daily basis. The pH at both sites was very 
similar, ranging from 5.3-8.4; however, the preponderance of measurements were 
>7 at both sites.  The pH observed at the two monitoring sites appear to be 
attributable to natural conditions. Marked variations in pH can also occur 
diurnally due to changes in primary production and respiration.
	Dissolved oxygen concentrations appeared to track depth for part of the 
cycle, with lowest values occurring on low tides.  Afternoon and evening values 
were not as low as early morning values, suggesting a diurnal component.  
Dissolved oxygen values at the two monitoring sites were generally high 
throughout the year with averages of 83.6% saturation and 6.6 mg/l for Big Bay 
Creek and 78.5% air saturation and 6.3 mg/l for St. Pierre Creek, with highest 
values in winter and lowest in summer.  Hypoxic events (<28% air saturation) 
were observed in every season, but summer was clearly the season with the 
greatest percent of time when DO was 28%. Whereas, supersaturation (>100% air 
saturation) occurred primarily in the winter, with values exceeding 120% at both 
creeks. There are a few differences between the two sites such as, hypoxic 
conditions occur more frequently at St. Pierre Creek.
	Unlike the other parameters monitored at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks, 
there appears to be no distinct seasonal trend in turbidity; however, monthly 
variability appeared greater at the St. Pierre site. This may be due to 
fluctuations in the amount of detritus being washed from the extensive salt 
marsh and upland sites that surround St. Pierre Creek.
	It appears that metal leachates from the pilings, even the new ones along 
Big Bay Creek, have negligible ecological effects, according to the 1994 study 
by Weis and Weis.  Their findings indicated that concentrations of the metals 
(Cr, Cu, and As) in sediments adjacent to pilings along Big Bay Creek were 
generally not significantly elevated, and there were no consistent differences 
in the benthic communities between the Big Bay and St. Pierre monitoring sites.
	However, the highest values of PAHs encountered (299.0 ng/g) during a 
study by Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews from 1993-1995 were in the sediments 
of Big Bay Creek; this station also had detectable levels of PCBs concentrations 
as well.  Whereas, the concentrations in St. Pierre Creek sediments were below 
the level of detection for persistent pesticides and for PCBs.  Overall, 
contaminant levels in sediments at the 34 sampling sites were below the level of 
detection for persistent pesticides and for PCBs, suggesting that the ACE is a 
relatively pristine system.

7. Associated researchers and projects:
	Two NERRS graduate fellows have concluded their examination of  the 
nutrient dynamics in the marsh sediments near our water quality monitoring 
stations.  Christopher T. Nietch studied carbon biogeochemistry and the effect 
of salinity and nutrient availability on marsh metabolism in tidal marshes.  The 
focus of Pallaoor V. Sundareshwar's study was on phosphorus dynamics in 
impacted and non-impacted coastal wetlands and the effect anthropogenic 
perturbations on natural processes.  Both fellows received their Ph.D. degrees 
in spring of 2000.
	Dr. Clark Alexander of Skidaway Institute continued the investigations of 
the sedimentation process in the ACE Basin. Concurrent studies were conducted in 
the several locations in the Ashepoo and South Edisto Rivers during May 1999.  
Continuous flow velocity readings were measured over a 13-hour period at an 
anchored station while discrete measurements of various water parameters (i.e., 
salinity, turbidity) were taken at various locations in the same water body. 
Deep sediment cores were also collected at the anchor stations.
	In the spring of 2000, SCDNR Geologists completed the construction of 
sediment/erosion tables (SET) in the ACE Basin NERR, including our water quality 
stations, to determine the effects hydrologic changes on the marsh elevation. 
	Dr. Amy Ringwood of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute received 
CICEET funding to conduct this study in ACE Basin and North Inlet/Winyah Bay 
Reserves.  Funds for this project were awarded in October, 1998.  Eight sites 
were selected in the ACE Basin, including the two water quality monitoring 
stations.  Oysters (Crassostrea virginica), grass shrimp (Paleomonetes pugio), 
and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) were collected from these sites 
during the February-April time frame.  Hepatopancreatic/liver tissues were 
dissected and used for three different cellular biomarker assays (lysosomal 
destabilization, glutathione concentrations, and lipid peroxidation).
	Drs. James T. Morris, Madilyn Fletcher, John Jensen, Alan Lewitus, Peter 
A. Noble, and Dwayne Porter of University of South Carolina received CISNet 
funding to conduct this three-year study in the North Inlet/Winyah Bay Reserve; 
and, prior to the first sampling season (summer 1999), the investigators added 
the ACE Basin NERR to the study.  The researchers will compare nutrient loading, 
nutrient dynamics, and productivity in the  North Inlet to that of the  S. 
Edisto River (ACE Basin NERR).

	Big Bay
a)	During the following periods, the specific conductivity and salinity 
readings are suspect.  The low readings are probably due to improper calibration 
procedures or a contaminated standard. The correction factors for the specific 
conductivity and salinity data were calculated as follow. First, a new 
conductivity standard (58.64 mS/cm) was prepared and then the conductivity 
sensor was fully immersed in the standard and then the specific conductivity and 
salinity of the standard were recorded.  Next, the sensor was calibrated, and 
the new specific conductivity and salinity readings were recorded.  The 
correction factor for the two parameters was calculated by dividing the reading 
taken after calibration by the reading taken prior to the calibration.  The 
specific conductivity and salinity data were multiplied by the correction 
factors (1.67 and 1.77, respectively). In addition, the dissolved oxygen (mg/L) 
readings were reduced by 10%, in accordance with the oxygen solubility table.

c) During the following periods of the February 11-March 6 deployment, dissolved 
oxygen (DO) readings ranged from 130 to 163 % air saturation, and rarely dropped 
below 130%.  Super saturation conditions (>100%) continued after this period, 
but the DO levels were lower.  The readings were not deleted because the high 
values corresponded with the highest water levels during that period, suggesting 
an environmental cause of the high readings.  In addition, the membrane was not 
damaged and YSI readings were similar to in-situ Winkler readings.  The 
YSI DO reading at deployment was 11.1 mg/l and the Winkler reading was 10.3 
mg/l.  The retrieval reading for YSI was 9.4 mg/l and the Winkler reading was 
7.2 mg/l.  A review of historical DO-water level correlation will help us 
evaluate these readings.

	St. Pierre
a)	During the following periods of the December 20, 1999-January 14, 2000 
deployment, dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted because the DO membrane was 
fouled during deployment.  The presence of a mud ball in the guard during 
retrieval indicate that the flow of oxygen to the membrane was restricted.

c)	During the following periods of the January 20-February 10 deployment, 
dissolved oxygen (DO) data were deleted because the DO membrane was punctured 
during deployment.  The DO membrane integrity during post deployment checks 
confirmed our assumption.  The DO readings increased to 200 or more % air 
saturation when submersed in salt water and dropped below 100 % when removed 
from the water.
	01/20/00	16:00:00	THRU		01/31/00   23:30:00

d)	During the following periods of the January 20-February 10 deployments, 
the specific conductivity and salinity readings were deleted.  The downward 
drift in the readings indicated that the probe was fouled.  We couldn't adjust 
the readings because no in-situ readings were taken.

	02/21/00	03:00:00-03:30:00
	02/22/00	03:30:00

d) At 17:30 on February 7, the turbidity spiked (1271 NTU).  The high spike was 
probably caused by an animal, a clump of plant matter, or sediment that passed 
by the sensor optics during the sampling interval. Data was deleted.

e) During the following periods, the dissolved oxygen data (DO) readings were 
deleted because the membrane was punctured during the deployment.   The DO 
membrane integrity during post deployment checks confirmed our assumption.  The 
DO readings increased to 200+ %air saturation when submersed in salt water and 
dropped below 100 % when removed from the water.

12. Other Remarks / Comments:
The NERR program has not yet adopted chlorophyll as a water quality parameter, 
however, some sites have began deploying the chlorophyll sensor on the YSI 6000. 
Please contact the Research Coordinator and/or the Reserve Technician for 
chlorophyll data.

Prior to 09/27/00 at 11:00:00 at Big Bay, the datalogger was replaced with a 
newly calibrated sonde.
