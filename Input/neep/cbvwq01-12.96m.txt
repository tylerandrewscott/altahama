2. Entry verification
The data were uploaded to the PC from the YSI 6000 data loggers and reviewed using 
PC6000 software from YSI. Graphs were produced and examined using the PC6000 software 
then printed out and filed in order to aid in reviewing  data to correlate any anomalous and 
outlying data.  Next, files were uploaded in .dat and comma delimited format which were 
opened in Excel 5.0 software and edited to remove extraneous information (headers, footers, 
spaces, and pre- and post-deployment data).  Monthly templates were used to form complete 
sets of monthly data sets.  Macros supplied by NERRS/CDMO were used to help with editing, 
formatting and identifying outliers in the database.  Suspect data (as in data believed to result 
from a damaged or biofouled probe) were evaluated according to Appendix B of the CDMO  
manual, edited and documented.  Missing data due to YSI maintenance (down time) was 
inserted into the spreadsheet  and was denoted by periods (.).  Data that were not within 
calibration range of the instrument were evaluated and removed from the record and denoted 
by periods (.).  Edited and raw data files were copied and archived in the Chesapeake Bay 
National Estuarine Research Reserve of Virginia (CBNERRVA) file server and uploaded to the 
CDMO FTP site.  All Taskinas Creek files from 1996 have been verified using the latest 
update of the Microsoft Excel 5.0 macro programs which identified outliers (values that fall 
outside of the calibration range - see section II.8 of this document) and other erroneous data.  
Outliers were determined according to the instruments' manufacturers manual. Rob Breeding, the 
SWMP Coordinator, and Jeff Shields, the RC, collected and edited data from 1/96-6/96.  
Bill Seufzer collected and edited data from 7/96-12/96.  Dr. William Reay and Tammy Dorman 
processed the data through the latest update of the CDMO macro and conducted final editing 
of the data.  Following final editing, Tammy Dorman uploaded the database to the CBNERRVA 
server and to CDMO.  


3. Research Objectives
The Taskinas Creek watershed is representative  of an inner coastal plain rural watershed 
within the southern Chesapeake Bay system.  This watershed  is dominated by forested and 
agricultural land uses with an increasing urban land use component.  The drainage basin is 
suited for investigating hydrologic  and nonpoint source water quality issues associated with 
changing land use patterns; these issues are of prime importance to the U.S. EPA Chesapeake 
Bay Program.  Continuously monitored physical water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, 
pH, specific conductance, turbidity, and temperature) provide long-term measurements which 
can be supplemented with shorter-term monitoring and process oriented studies.  
Measurements were taken every 15 minutes at the Taskinas Creek site and the YSI data 
loggers were maintained, downloaded, cleaned, and calibrated at two-week intervals.  

4.  Research methods 
The CBNERRVA maintains a long-term water quality-monitoring program, which consists of 
a single station located in the transitional zone of the York River tributary.  A simple 
deployment was arranged with the State Park where a secured YSI 6000 unit hangs at a fixed 
depth (0.5 m above the creek bed) from an overhanging tree approximately six meters 
upstream from the parks canoe landing.   Specific conductance, pH, depth, temperature, DO 
saturation, and turbidity are recorded at 15-minute intervals.  Salinity and dissolved oxygen 
are calculated as a function of temperature and specific conductivity readings.  At 
approximately two-week intervals, the data logger was returned to the lab for downloading, 
cleaning, membrane replacement and recalibration.  Maintenance intervals were determined 
according to the amount of  biofouling that occurred and to accommodate battery life. A 
second YSI 6000 data logger was deployed following retrieval of the original YSI datasonde in 
order to maintain a continuous record. All procedures are in accordance with YSI Operating 
Manual methods, sections 3 and 7.  Standards for pH, and conductivity were purchased from 
YSI.  Turbidity standard was purchased from Advanced Polymer Systems.  Data was reviewed 
and edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of the 
CDMO manual.  

5.  Site location and character
Taskinas Creek (TC) Component: (Latitude 37 deg 24’ 54.04617” N, Longitude 76 deg 42' 
51.75733” W)  The Taskinas Creek Component of the CBNERR-VA is on the south shore of 
the York River in James City County near Williamsburg.  The site is approximately 44 
kilometers upstream from the river's mouth and 15 kilometers downstream from West Point.  
Headwaters of Taskinas Creek are near the town of Croaker, which is located approximately 
10 kilometers north of Williamsburg.  The creek flows in a northeasterly direction covering a 
distance of about 5.5 kilometers eventually feeding into the York River.  The sampling 
station is located on the second bend from the mouth of Taskinas Creek within York River 
State Park, about 6 meters upstream from the parks canoe landing.  The sediment type at 
this station consists of approximately 42% fine sand, 30% clay, and 28% silt.  The creek is 
tidal for approximately half of its length with a tidal range of 0.00-1.3m.  The non-tidal 
portion contains feeder streams, which drain oak-hickory forests, maple-gum-oak-ash 
swamps and freshwater marshes.  The marshes near the creek mouth are brackish with a 
salinity range from 3-13 ppt.  The shoreline is moderately low with fringing marsh and tidal 
flats.  Taskinas Creek mainly drains the undeveloped York River State Park watershed, 
however the watershed is lightly impacted above the State Park by residential development 
and selective hardwood logging.  Wildlife populations have been shown to influence 
microbiological water quality within the watershed.  

6.  Data collection period:
Ongoing sampling at Taskinas Creek (TC) began September 1995.

7.  Associated researchers and projects:
A volunteer water quality-monitoring program sponsored by the Alliance for the Chesapeake 
Bay has been ongoing at Taskinas Creek for several years, beginning January 10, 1990. This 
project samples some overlapping parameters  including dissolved oxygen and salinity on a 
two-week basis.

9. Coded variable indicator and variable code definitions 
Site definitions: TC = Taskinas Creek.
File definitions: YSI deployment site/month/year (ex.: TC0995 = Taskinas Creek data from 
September 1995). 

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data):
Frequent data anomalies were recorded in depth levels for several months due to low-pressure 
weather fronts.  This data remained in the record.  According to the CDMO Operations 
manual version 3.0, depth measurements taken with the non-vented level probe can be 
influenced up to 0.39m (1.3ft) during severe low-pressure hurricane events.  Depth went 
negative during periods of low tide and was accompanied by drops in conductivity (and 
salinity).  It appears that the low tide left the YSI suspended in the open air.  The data were 
left intact and should be used with caution for the months of January through June.  Starting 
with July data were extracted in accordance with Version 3.0 of the CDMO Manual.

Missing data is either the result of
  1) the YSI not deployed
  2) YSI out of the water (negative depth with salinity of zero)
  3) a probe not attached
  4) a probe malfunction

12. Remarks
In 1996, several files were recorded in Daylight Savings Time instead of Eastern Standard 
Time (EST).  Tammy Dorman corrected the following files so that they would be in 
accordance with the NERR System Wide Monitoring Program by displaying the date and the 
time in EST.  
	TC960503.csv was corrected to EST		TC960819.csv was corrected to EST
	TC960514.csv was corrected to EST		TC960906.csv was corrected to EST
	TC960530.csv was corrected to EST		TC960920.csv was corrected to EST
	TC960626.csv was corrected to EST		TC961007.csv was corrected to EST
	TC960711.csv was corrected to EST		TC961024.csv was corrected to EST
	TC960810.csv was corrected to EST

Turbidity data often resulted in anomalous negative data.  The winter of 95/96 saw four 
major snowfall periods from January through March.  Hurricane Bertha moved through the 
area 7/12-7/14 with 3-5 inches of rain.  Hurricane Fran moved through the area 9/5-9/6.  The 
summer of 96 was one of the wettest on record for the state of Virginia.  The following 
corrections were made in order to align time data sequencing.
08/10/96 16:45:00 to 08/20/96 10:00:00		Time clock off; corrected
08/30/96 02:00:00 to 08/31/96 23:15:00		Time clock off; corrected
09/01/96 01:45:00 to 09/03/96 15:00:00		Time clock off; corrected

Any regions of data with negative depth values due to low tides or low-pressure system should 
be viewed with caution. In some instances the probes are clearly out of water and have been 
noted.  Depth data should be considered relative depth.  The instrument was deployed on a 
rope that was tied to a tree branch and therefore may have been deployed at a slightly 
different depth for each deployment.  This situation was corrected in the fall of 1996 with 
the use of a steel cable and mounting hardware that keeps the instrument at a fixed altitude 
from the creek bottom, however is influenced by the current causing the instrument to sway 
as the tides change.  Taskinas Creek experiences extremely low tides where it is difficult to 
determine times when the probes are out of the water and when they are not.  If the YSI 
would have been more securely deployed and at a fixed depth from the bottom, the problem 
of exposure from low tides might have been lessened.  Also there is an ongoing problem with 
land subsidence in Taskinas Creek, which at times affects our deployment because the tree 
from which our unit is attached, sinks with the land.  Current efforts are being made to 
construct a more stable and elevation referenced station.
