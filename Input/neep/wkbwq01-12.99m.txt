2. Entry Verification:

Data are uploaded to the PC from the Data loggers and graphs are produced using 
EcoWatch software.  Graphs are evaluated for suspect data, as may result from 
probe failure.  Notes are made of any unusual data, and sensors are 
reconditioned as necessary.  Files are then exported as .csv files using 
EcoWatch software.  The .csv files are imported into EXCEL, edited by removing 
headers and footers, and saved as EXCEL files.  Data at the beginning and end of 
each data record that were recorded when the instruments were out of the water 
are deleted.  These data are identified by field notes that document the times 
in and out of the water, and by unusual depth data (usually negative or near 
zero).  The appropriate files are merged to form complete monthly data sets and 
are saved as separate EXCEL files.  Data that are missing because the 
instruments were not deployed (as during maintenance periods) are denoted by 
periods (.).  These times are noted in section 11 (Missing Data) of this 
document. Two types of post-calibration values are also used to determine 
operational viability of the sensors while deployed.  One is obtained in the lab 
by placing uncleaned probes in standard solutions and recording the values given 
by the Data loggers.  The second type is obtained in the field using a newly 
calibrated Data logger (referred to as a control sonde).  Data from this 
instrument are recorded in the field at the time of the last scheduled reading 
by the deployed Data loggers.  Both post-calibration values are reported in 
section 12 (Other Remarks/Notes) of this document, and may be used to determine 
the quality of the data recorded by the instruments (particularly DO) after two 
weeks in the field.  Any erroneous data that are identified as being caused by 
probe failures (as determined upon examination of the data plots, or by post-
calibration values) are deleted and replaced with periods, and noted in section 
11 (Missing Data) of this document.  Sensor readings that greatly deviate from 
known values of standards after the two week deployment are not necessarily 
believed to be a result of probe failure, however.  If biofouling is believed to 
be the reason for poor agreement between the sensors and the standard values at 
the end of a deployment, the data are retained and noted in section 10 (Data 
Anomalies) of this document.  Symptoms of probe failures are extreme noise in 
the record, unrealistically high or negative data, or noisy or negative readings 
in standard solutions.  Examples of many such failures are given in the CDMO 
Manual (Version 3.0). .  Finally, the CDMO macros (update version 11/96) are 
then run on these new monthly files to identify missing times and/or dates, to 
format the width and decimal places of columns, and to identify outliers and 
other erroneous data. Scott Phipps is responsible for all data management.

3. Research Objectives/Study Purpose:

The Data loggers are programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 
minutes.  Presently, two instruments are located in the Weeks Bay Reserve.  One 
is located at the mouth of Fish River (provides ~73% of Weeks Bay's freshwater), 
and the other is located at the eastern side of Weeks Bay, near the mouth.

Beyond the mouth of Weeks Bay is a larger embayment referred to as Bon Secour 
Bay.  Hydrographic profiles made in Bon Secour Bay in past years show that 
bottom waters (which flow into Weeks Bay on a rising tide) are often anoxic in 
summer and fall months.  Fish River water quality is also in question, as 
largely non-point source nutrient loading to this river may be quite high during 
periods of high flow in the river.  Therefore, it is of interest to determine if 
poor water quality periodically observed in Weeks Bay is generated within the 
bay proper, or is being washed in from Fish River or Bon Secour Bay with 
changing tides.  By using salinity and water level as tracers, data from these 
two sites may be used to infer the source and fate of low oxygen water.  

There is a great deal of value in having a baseline data set for any management 
site.  Changes or trends in any monitored parameters are readily apparent.  
Weeks Bay is useful as a model for estuary function and this data is necessary 
for the profile of the model. 

4. Research Methods:

Data loggers are moored on private docks.  At each dock, a PVC tube is attached 
to a piling at the end of the dock using ratchets equipped with zinc disks (to 
help reduce corrosion) and nylon straps.  A chain, attached to the cap of the 
tube, is shackled to the bail of the Data logger.  Chains and tubes were cut to 
a length that places the Data logger probes just below the bottom of the tube 
and 0.5 m above the sediment when in place.  A nylon rope tied to the bottom of 
the piling also runs through the tube and is attached to the bale of the Data 
logger to serve as a safeguard against the loss of the Data loggers in the event 
that the tube breaks away from the piling.

The Data loggers are programmed to record temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) percent saturation and concentration, pH, water 
level and turbidity every 30 minutes central standard time (CST).  A newly 
calibrated Data logger is also used to record the above parameters at the same 
time the deployed Data logger takes its first reading to insure its initial 
accuracy.  The instruments are usually serviced (instruments post-calibrated, 
data uploaded, instruments cleaned and re-calibrated) every 14 days; however, 
they are programmed to log for 30 days in the event they cannot be serviced on 
schedule.  Just before deployment, window screening (1mm mesh size) is wrapped 
once around the cage that protects the sensors, and secured with plastic cable 
ties.  Window screening is also secured in the bottom of the cage with silicone 
sealant.  This is done to reduce error in the data that may be due to larger 
animals moving in and out of the cage during the deployment.  This does not, 
however, preclude smaller animals such as barnacle and polychaete larvae from 
entering the cage and settling on the sensors.

Before the Data loggers are retrieved, a newly calibrated Data logger is lowered 
to the depth of the deployed instrument, and readings are logged at the same 
time that the deployed instruments are programmed to record.  Post-calibration 
values are obtained in the lab by placing uncleaned probes in standard solutions 
and recording the values given by the Data loggers.

Uploading, cleaning, maintenance, and calibration are conducted as described in 
the YSI Operating Manual (addendum 7/94, sections 3, 4, and 7).  Calibration 
standards, required for pH turbidity and salinity, are purchased from a 
scientific supply house.  Dissolved oxygen is calibrated using a calibration cup 
filled with about 1/2 cm tap water, which creates a 100% water-saturated air 
environment for the sensors when the sonde is placed in the cup.  The sensors 
are allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 minutes in the cup before DO 
(%Saturation) is calibrated.  Servicing the instruments results in a period of 
about 3 to 4 hours of missing data every two weeks at each site. 

5. Site Location and Character:

Weeks Bay (30 23' N, 87 50' W) is a small, shallow, microtidal sub-estuary, 
located on the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  It 
is nearly diamond shaped, and its longitudinal axis (3.4 km long) runs nearly 
north-south from the head, where the Fish River flows in, to the mouth, where 
water is exchanged with Mobile Bay.  Its widest point (3.1 km) is located near 
the center of the estuary, where the Magnolia River discharges into eastern side 
of Weeks Bay.  Average depth is 1.4 m, although there are two areas where depths 
are significantly greater.  The first is in the mouth of the bay, where the 
average depth is 6 m; the second is about 200 m upstream of the mouth of the 
Fish River, where the average depth is 3.5 m.  Tides are principally diurnal, 
and have a mean range of 0.4 m.

The Fish River drainage basin encompasses 14300 hectares and contributes 
approximately 73% to the total incoming freshwater flow with the Magnolia River 
supplying the rest.  Mean combined discharge is 9 cubic meters per second; 
although freshets up to 4 times larger occur throughout the year.  These 
characteristics result in a freshwater residence time of 13 days under average 
discharge conditions, with a range from 0.5 to 100 days.  Salinity in Weeks Bay 
varies substantially both temporally and spatially.  During periods of high flow 
in the river, salinity in the bay may be fresh from the head to the mouth, 
except in the deeper holes of the estuary that are not as easily flushed.  
However, during periods of low flow in the river, wind velocity and tidal stage 
are strong factors influencing salinity structure.  Salinity greater than 25 ppt 
is rarely observed in Weeks Bay and is usually restricted to the southern 
portion of the estuary near the mouth.

Site FR (Fish River; 30 24.97'N, 87 49.37'W) is located at the mouth of Fish 
River at a mean depth of about 2m.  Sediment type is sandy-silt, and there are 
small patches of Vallisineria sp. growing near (but not directly under) the Data 
logger.  Land use in the water shed is largely agricultural, with some 
residential use.  Directly surrounding the site, land use is largely public and 
semi-public.  Nutrient concentrations at this site are variable and may be quite 
high, with nitrate and phosphate concentrations ranging from approximately 4-100 
µM and <0.5 to 7.5 µM, respectively, over the previous 10 years (Alabama 
Department of Environmental Management).  Over the past year, salinity ranged 
from 0.0 to 21.3 ppt at this site.

Site WB (Weeks Bay; 30 19.98' N, 87 48.54' W) is located near the south-eastern 
shore of the Weeks Bay, about 0.5 miles from the mouth of the estuary.  Mean 
water depth at this site is about 0.9 m; sediment type is sandy-silt.  Land use 
around this site is almost exclusively residential, with agriculture occurring 
inland.  Nutrient concentrations are much lower at this site than at site FR; 
over the previous 10  years, nitrate and phosphate concentrations here ranged 
from approximately 0.1 to 50 µM and 0.04 to 0.45 µM, respectively.  Salinity 
ranged from approximately 0 to 24.3 ppt over the past year.

10. Data Anomalies:

Specific information: 
January 1999: At site FR, 1/14/99 - 1/28/99, DO record seems erratic, especially 
during the beginning of deployment but post-calibration was normal, data left in 
the record.
At site FR, 1/28/99 11:30 – 1/31/99 23:30:00, all DO data were deleted for this 
deployment, data was erratic and upon post calibration it was found that the 
probe had a high charge and was not functioning properly.
At site WB, 1/14/99 - 1/28/99, DO record seems normal but the probe read very 
low on post-calibration, reason unknown, data left in the record.
 
February 1999: At site FR, 2/01/99, 00:00:00 - 2/25/99, 09:00:00; DO went 
negative for 2 days starting at 00:00:00 on 2/01/99 and then returned to normal.  
Post calibration indicated that the probe 
was functioning properly and it continued to function properly after re-
calibration.  The reason for this malfunction is unknown but all DO data 
following the negative readings for this deployment were deleted.
At site FR, 2/25/99 16:00:00 - 3/11/99 08:30:00, unknown DO probe malfunction, 
possibly damaged 
membrane, all data for this deployment was deleted.

torn membrane suspected. DO data were deleted from 02/20/99 01:30:00 to 2/25/99 
09:30:00. On 2/19/99, at 8:30:00, turbidity went off scale and continued very 
erratic, readings were above probe's range, this may have been a probe 
malfunction or barnacles, however, all turbidity data for this month were 
deleted.

not accomplished quickly enough to replace the sonde for the 12:30 measurement 
and this datum is missing from the record.

November 1999: At site FR, no turbidity probe was deployed for the month of 
November.
At site WB, no turbidity probe was deployed for the month of November.

December 1999: At site FR, 12/2/99, 12:30:00 through the end of the month; depth 
data was incorrect due to possible incorrect calibration, all depth data were 
deleted.
At site FR, no turbidity probe was deployed until 12/2/99 at 12:30:00.
At site WB, no turbidity probe was deployed for the month of December.
At site WB, 12/22/99 - 12/24/99; combination of full moon and winter solstice 
produced very strong spring tides and lows were 0.25m below mean low tide.  
Probes appeared to be out of the water or at the surface several times during 
these 3 days.  Several depth outliers occurred, but this data were left in the 
record. 

General Information:
We have deleted data only when technical difficulties resulted in questionable 
data.  Therefore, we feel that extreme caution should be used when evaluating 
these data (especially DO % sat. and concentration) because of problems with 
biofouling.  Particularly during the summer months, biofouling can cause severe 
degradation of the DO calibration over the two-week deployments.  At times the 
DO deviation from calibration at the end of a deployment was greater than 80% 
(in a water-saturated air environment).  We have made note of any data that we 
consider suspect because of biofouling, based on post-calibration values 
reported by the sensors.  We also have provided the data that were taken in the 
field at the time of the final logging interval before retrieval of the deployed 
Data loggers, as well as the post-calibration values (for details see section 4, 
above) in section 12 (Other Remarks/Notes) below.  We encourage anyone using the 
YSI data to first compare these data to these discrete Data logger readings and 
post-calibration values on the given dates before evaluating the data.  If the 
user desires, it is possible to use these data to correct the deployed YSI data 
using regression analysis.  If not, then the user should delete compromised data 
at his or her own discretion.
