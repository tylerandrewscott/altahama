2.  Entry verification
The .dat and .csv versions of the raw data files were uploaded to a PC from YSI 
6000 or 6600 dataloggers. Raw data was uploaded and plotted using EcoWatch 
software. CDMO macros were also used in EXCEL 5.0 to identify anomalous or 
problem data in the files.  The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro allows the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro 
will allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel 
file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In 
addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro 
allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis. 

Comma delimited files are opened in Microsoft EXCEL 5.0 and edited by removing 
unnecessary headers, footers or spaces and any data which corresponds to the 
instrument being out of the water for maintenance.  Next, data plots were 
produced and examined for any anomalies using the CDMO graphing Macro for each 
variable. Suspect data were evaluated as to being either good or bad based on 
criteria outlined in the CDMO manual version 3.0/4.0.  If the data were 
determined to be bad, they were deleted from the final edited .txt file and then 
documented in the metadata.  If it could not be determined whether or not 
suspect data were bad (as was often the case with turbidity) the data was left 
in the final edited .txt file and noted in the metadata as anomalous. The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) and Turbidity (Turb) probes were the most problematic.  In 
instances where data values increased or decreased in an exponential fashion and 
or intermittently went outside the accepted range for that instrument and never 
returned to normal, the data was considered suspect, noted in the metadata, and 
removed from the final edited data file.  Missing data due to equipment failure 
or maintenance were replaced with periods (.). The date/hour and column reformat 
macros were then run on the data files before being saved in their final edited 
form (.txt).  Edited (.txt) and raw (.csv) files were then FTP'd to the Sun 
Sparc II server and archived. The most current CDMO macros are available on the 
NERRS CDMO home page.  Dave White and Jennifer Jarrell edited and archived the 
2000 data for Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek, and Oyster Landing. 

3.  Research Objectives
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data 
for North Inlet/Winyah Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in 
water quality over time.  Three sites were chosen; one to represent our pristine 
site and the other two to represent impacted sites.  The Oyster Landing site is 
located near the center of the Reserve and is considered pristine.  Debidue 
Creek and Thousand Acre are both located in waterways that receive run-off from 
heavily developed areas.  Measurements were taken every 30 minutes over roughly 
two week collecting periods at the Oyster Landing, Debidue Creek and Thousand 
Acre sites. 

4.  Research methods (YSI 6000 dataloggers)
YSI dataloggers are currently mounted in a 4" diameter PVC pipe which is 
strapped to a treated 2" X 6" board; and then attached via stainless steel bands 
to a piling at the Thousand Acre, Debidue Creek and Oyster Landing sites.  The 
PVC pipe which houses the data loggers has two large windows cut out near the 
bottom for the probes to have direct contact with the water column.  A stop bolt 
placed through the PVC pipe below the cut out windows keeps the datalogger 
exactly one foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  Every 30 minutes measurements 
of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, water 
temperature, pH, turbidity, and water level are recorded.  The two-week sampling 
interval has been selected due to biofouling of the individual probes and 
expected battery life.  At the end of each sampling interval, the dataloggers 
were brought back to the laboratory to be downloaded, cleaned and recalibrated 
following procedures in YSI Service Manual and the Standard Operating Procedures 
V3.0 provided by NERR SWMP.  Downtime for this maintenance is roughly 24 hrs.   
Before the instruments were cleaned and recalibrated a post calibration reading 
was taken from each instrument in fresh standard to see if any of the 
instruments exhibited drift (see II-13).  The pH probe was calibrated using a 
two point method and either 4,7 or 7,10 standards.  The turbidity probe 
calibration also used a two-point method using 0 &100 NTU standards.  Specific 
Conductivity was calibrated using a one-point method and a 10 ms/cm standard 
which was purchased through Fisher Scientific.  The turbidity wiper and DO 
membrane were changed after each deployment.  After approximately 24 hours of 
down time for cleaning and overnight relaxing of the DO membrane, the YSI 
dataloggers were re-deployed.


5.  Site location and character
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States in two tidal estuaries, North 
Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, 
located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type 
estuary (Pritchard, 1955).  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous 
winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal 
anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine 
forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The 
Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955), 
which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the 
largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km 
south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which 
are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain 
approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  Descriptions of the three 
sampling stations are as follows:

A) Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:17:57; long. 79:15:36) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek and is on the NW 
corner of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh (this site was relocated 07-19-
99 to the current location due to heavy siltation and degrading data quality).  
The present site is about 15m from the mouth of the creek.  At the sampling 
site, creek depth is approximately 2 m MHW and creek width is approximately 10 
m.  The creek empties into the northeastern side of the mid portion of Winyah 
Bay and directly drains pine forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 
0 to 15 ppt. and tidal flux is approximately 1m.  The bottom is most composed of 
fine sediments and detritus.  Georgetown, 5 km upstream from the Thousand Acre 
site and on the southern side of Winyah Bay, is the homeport for a number of 
heavy industries including a steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a coal 
fired power plant.  A public sewage treatment plant, which discharges into the 
bay, is also located in Georgetown.

B) Oyster Landing (OL) - (lat.  33:20:58; long.  79:11:34). The Oyster Landing 
monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area located at 
the end of the Oyster Landing pier which is also where the NI-WB Bay NERR 
weather station site is located.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of 
Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of North Inlet.  The sampling site is 
located approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of Crabhaul Creek.  The creek 
directly drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0-
32 ppt. and average tidal flux is approximately 1.4m.  The creek has an average 
depth of ~2 m MHW and average width of ~150m MHW.  The bottom mostly is 
comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus.

C) Debidue Creek (DC) - (lat 33:21:37, long 79:10:05). The Debidue Creek 
monitoring site is considered an impacted site that is located approximately 1 
km south of the Debidue Colony.  The Colony is a large development built on man-
made canals that directly drain into the northern portion of Debidue Creek.  The 
DC site is also located in an ocean-dominated Spartina marsh that was formerly 
surrounded by pine-dominated uplands.  Salinity can range from 0 to full 
strength sea water and an average tidal flux of approximately 2 meters.  The 
approximate depth and width at MHW at the site is 2.2 and 70 m respectively.  
The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and 
detritus.


6.  Data collection period
Thousand Acre data collection began January 1, 1995.  Debidue Creek sampling 
began March 5, 1998. Oyster Landing data collection began in 1995, however, it 
was not considered a SWMP site until 1996 when the collection site was switched 
from Caledonia to Oyster Landing. All sampling is ongoing.

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the general 
information link on CDMO homepage) and online at the CDMO homepage  
http://inlet.geol.sc.edu/cdmohome.html.  Data are available in text tab-
delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format.

8.  Associated researchers and projects
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core-monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  Thousand Acre is our permanent monitoring station 
for the NERR monitoring program, but Oyster Landing and Debidue Creek were also 
sampled beginning in 1998. These stations are also included in our NIW core-
monitoring program.

A long-term fish survey is also done at the Oyster Landing site bi-weekly.  
Species present, total weight, individual weights and standard lengths of fish 
that utilize the marsh at low tide are recorded.  In the spring/summer/fall 
month's fish utilizing the marsh at high tide are also sampled.

The NERR weather station is also located at the Oyster Landing site.  Air 
temperature and humidity, barometric pressure, solar radiation (total and PAR), 
wind speed and direction, and precipitation are measured.

11.  Data anomalies (suspect data)

Note:  Beginning on 04/14/00 data at OL was collected with a new 6600 data 
logger.  Due to a warm-up period, this logger time-stamps the data at 52 seconds 
past the 30-minute interval.  Therefore the data required changes to the time 
stamp in order to use the CDMO macros and generate a finalized text file.  For 
example, data in final text files recorded at 10:30:00 was actually collected at 
10:30:52.  Other miscellaneous time stamp changes are recorded in section 14 
(Other remarks).

10/20/00-11/08/00	Bad time stamp, changed times (for example 11:00:00 is

10/20/00	Turbidity probe may not have been functioning properly - data may be 
suspect.

11/30/00	Controlled burn and rain/snow may have influenced some turbidity 
data this month and into December.


Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
