2.  Entry verification:

The data were directly downloaded from the YSI PC6600 data loggers into 
the YSI Ecowatch for Windows program in the PC. The data were graphed and 
visually checked for any obvious outliers. Notes are made of any unusual data 
or faulty probes. The data is then exported as a .csv file into an Excel 
spreadsheet.  The data files were edited to remove headers, footers, and 
spaces. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro was used to QA/QC the data. The macro 
automatically formatted the column widths to the correct number of decimal 
places based on YSI sensor specifications. It QA/QC's the data file for missing 
data points and filled all cells without data with periods. Periods were later
removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank.  It also compiled a 
list of all data that fell outside the stated range of the different data 
logger probes. An explanation for the missing and the deleted data is included 
in this meta data sheet.  The files were then transferred along with the 
associated metadata by disk to the CDMO.  The files are archived at OWC. Dr. 
David Klarer is responsible for both data logger deployment and data 
management.


3.  Research Objectives:

Measurements are taken every 15 minutes over approximately two-week 
periods at four  sites within the Old Woman Creek- three in the estuary 
proper- one in the upper reaches at State Route 2 (SU), one near the mouth 
just south of State Route 6 (WM), and the third site is upstream from the WM 
site (OL). The final site (BR) is just upstream of the first riffle zone above 
the estuary in Old Woman Creek proper. The purpose of this monitoring program 
is to document the role of this Great Lakes estuary in the Lake Erie 
ecosystem, particularly the estuary's role in mitigating storm flow that 
passes through it.  The role of the OL site is to document the degree of 
intrusion by lake water during northerly winds and subsequent seiche events.

4.  Research methods:

The YSI monitoring program began on 24 March, 2003 at all four sites.  The 
sampling at all sites ended for the year on 15 December, 2003.  Prior to 
deployment of the data loggers, a 4-inch diameter PVC pipe was bolted to a 
metal 8-foot long metal post that had been driven into the sediment.  Each 
pipe had 4 rows of holes or 4 vertical slits ¾" wide drilled into it spanning 
the area of the probe guard on the data logger so that the probes would have 
direct contact with the surrounding waters.  Dissolved oxygen, pH, 
temperature, turbidity, and specific conductance readings are taken when the 
instrument is pulled at each site. The data loggers are replaced in the field 
after a one, two, or three-week deployment, depending on temperature and 
degree of fouling of the data loggers.  The data was retrieved from each data 
logger and each data logger was recalibrated (according to the directions in 
the YSI Operations Manual) before being returned to the field.  Conductivity, 
pH (2 point calibration), and turbidity (2 point calibration) are calibrated 
using commercial standards. Formazin (Hach, 4000 NTU) was diluted to prepare 
the standards for turbidity.  These standards were prepared prior to each 
deployment. The data loggers at sites WM and SU have water level sensors while 
the loggers at sites BR and OL have non-vented depth sensors.
 
5.  Site Location and Character:

	Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
southern shore of Lake Erie, slightly east of the city of Huron, Ohio 
(Latitude 41º 23'N; Longitude 82º 33'W). Land use in the Old Woman Creek (OWC) 
watershed is primarily row crop agriculture. Other than the non-point source 
pollutants coming into the estuary from these agricultural practices and from 
the town of Berlin Heights, there are no other major pollution sources in the 
estuary. Salinity in Old Woman Creek is normally 1 ppt. or less, although it 
will rise, on occasion, to nearly 2 ppt. The tidal range in Lake Erie (and 
therefore in the estuary) is on the order of 4 cm or less. Water levels in the 
estuary and in the creek are extremely variable, with changes occurring daily, 
seasonally and annually.
 	The data logger at the State Route 6 (WM) site (Latitude 41º 22' 57" N, 
Longitude 82º 30'54" W) is very close to the mouth of Old Woman Creek.  In 
this portion of the Reserve, the creek is very shallow but extends over a 
large surface area.  This site frequently experiences influx of Lake Erie 
waters.  The bottom sediments at this site are silty clay.  At the beginning 
of the deployment for 2003, there was no rooted aquatic vegetation directly 
adjacent to the site, although there was both emergent and submerged 
vegetation within 3 meters of the site. By mid September, Phragmites australis 
had grown up around the data logger trap.  The data logger is about .15 meters 
above the bottom sediments. On June 4 at about 08:00 the old guard on the 
sonde was changed to the new guard, so this effectively raised the logger 5 cm 
within the trap and sediment was removed from under the trap.  On October 6 at 
(08:00:00) the new data logger deployed has the old short guard so the logger 
was lowered 5 cm within the trap..
	The data logger at the State Route 2 (SU) site (Latitude 41º 22' 2" N, 
Longitude 82º 30'26" W) is very near the southern boundary of the Reserve.  
This site is in the upper reaches of the estuary.  The data logger is sited 
near a concrete piling of the eastbound Ohio State Route 2 bridge.  At this 
site, the creek is relatively deep and narrow.  Although water direction and 
flow is influenced at this site by changes in Lake Erie water levels, this 
site doesn't have direct contact with Lake Erie waters.  The bottom sediments 
at this site are silty clay.  There is no rooted aquatic vegetation near or 
upstream from this site.  The data logger is about .165 meters above the 
bottom at this site.  On August 25 just before (08:15:00)  the trap was 
lowered 4 cm to compensate for very low water levels.	
The data logger at site Lower Esturay (OL) (Latitude 41º 22' 55" N, Longitude 
82º 30'51" W ) is in the lower reaches of the estuary. This site is not in 
direct sight of the mouth, so northerly winds and resulting seiche activities 
should be less noticeable at this site.  The bottom sediments are silty clay. 
This site is located at the northern tip of a Nelumbo lutea bed, so plants are 
immediately adjacent to the data logger. The base of data logger is about 25 
cm above the sediment. On 6 April the sonde was retrieved because the trap had 
been severely damaged by storm runoff.  The trap was reset and a logger 
redeployed on April 14 at 09:20:00. 
	The data logger at site BR (Latitude 41º 20'54" N, Longitude 82º 
30'30"W) is located in the lower portion of the creek proper. Just upstream 
from the data logger, Berlin Road crosses Old Woman Creek.  The site is just 
upstream of the first riffle area above the estuary.  Unlike the other three 
sites, Lake Erie water levels have no impact on this site. The bottom of the 
creek at this site is a combination of rocks interspersed with some clay-silt 
that has been washed in from upstream.  There are no aquatic macrophytes at or 
near this site.  The sonde is 15 cm above the bottom.

Coordinator (RC) retains the right to be fully credited for having collected 
and processed the data.  Following academic courtesy standard, the RC and the 
NERR site where the data were collected will be contacted and fully 
acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any part of the data are 
used. 
 The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only as good 
as the quality assurance and quality control procedures outlined in the 
enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for 
its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons. The Federal 
government and the State of Ohio do not assume liability to the Recipient or 
third persons, nor will the Federal government or the State of Ohio reimburse 
or indemnify the Recipient for its liability due to any losses resulting in 
any way from the use of this data.
NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see section 1. Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under general 
information link on CDMO homepage) an online at the CDMO homepage 
http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/.  Data are available in text tab-
delimited format, Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited 
format from the CDMO.

8.  Associated projects: Replicate samples for chemical analysis of the water 
are collected at each site every time the data loggers are changed. Samples 
for phytoplankton determination are collected at the same time at sites near 
the data logger deployment sites.  Additionally, a 26 hour sampling regime 
(samples are collected at 2 hour intervals over the 26 hours) is conducted at 
the WM site once during each month.

12.  Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Periods were later
removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank.  Data are missing 
due to equipment failure when no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre- and post-) problems.  For more details on deleted data, 
see Anomalous Data Section (11).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.


13.  Post deployment information

End of Deployment Post-calibration Readings in Standard Solutions: 
Dissolved oxygen standard is 100%, unless noted. Depth is always 0.0 meters. 
The specific conductivity standard is 1 mS/cm. The pH standard is 7.00.
