2. Entry verification
The data are transmitted every thirty minutes from YSI 6600 datasondes 
via VHF packet radio using Ecowatch software to a base station PC. Files 
are first examined and graphed using Ecowatch software.  Missing and/or 
anomalous data are noted. Files are then transferred to a Macintosh 
computer and opened in Microsoft Excel software and edited. Missing data due 
to routine YSI maintenance and probe failure or communication errors are 
inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by periods (.). Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month of data.  Files are verified by means of CDMO 
Excel macros. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to automatically 
format column widths to the correct number decimal places based on the YSI 
sensor specifications. It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
datalogger is designed to measure (outliers). The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file 
from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data. Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month of data. In addition, in November 1999 a 
graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to produce single 
parameter and missing point graphs on a monthly basis. All files are graphed in 
Excel and examined by Jaimie Wolf and Dr. Richard Langan in order that anomalous 
data points can be identified.



3. Research Objectives
In 2000, YSI 6600 datasondes were deployed in Great Bay and in the 
Squamscott and Lamprey Rivers, part of the National Estuarine Research Reserves' 
(NERRS) Systemwide Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to develop and 
maintain temporally intensive long-term datasets of physio-chemical parameters 
of water quality at locations that are representative of the Great Bay Estuarine 
System. The Great Bay site is relatively unimpacted, while the two tidal river 
sites (Lamprey and Squamscott) have large drainage basins and are impacted by 
both point (wastewater treatment plants) and nonpoint sources of pollution.  In 
addition to establishing a baseline of water quality, and understanding the 
spatial and temporal variability of important indicators of estuarine water 
quality, the data is used by a number of researchers in the analysis of physical 
and biological processes.

4. Research Methods
Datasondes are programmed to obtain measurements of specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, pH, temperature, water level, 
and turbidity every half-hour. The instruments are deployed continuously during 
ice-free seasons, except for brief periods when they are removed for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration. Pre and post-deployment calibrations are 
performed using the diagnostics menu of the YSI Ecowatch program and QA/QC 
procedures developed by NERR Research Coordinators and YSI engineers. 
VWR conductivity and pH standards are used for calibration. Hach formazin is 
used to calibrate turbidity probes. The sonde in Great Bay is deployed in a YSI 
EM 550 buoy, while the Lamprey and Squamscott river stations are piling mounted 
deployments (see below). Because the sonde at the central Great Bay site (GB) is 
deployed in an EM 550 surface buoy, it does not measure depth data. 
Depth data for the GB site was obtained using time adjusted water level data 
from the Squamscott River site (SQ). The water level correction was established 
in 1999 by comparing water level data from a moored instrument at the Great Bay 
site with data collected at the Squamscott River site.
In 2001 we had YSI 6600 sondes at all stations. So we were able to run the 
instruments in unattended mode as well as transmit the data via radio telemetry. 
This was useful in the even a radio failed to report data.  Corresponding data 
from the unattended file was reported. This was an improvement over previous 
years, as it resulted in much less loss of data due to radio failure. 


5. Site Location and Character

Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Squamscott, Lamprey and Winnicut Rivers plus smaller streams. High 
tide influence from Little Bay and associated rivers 
Pollutant influence: clean reference site

Deployment
The instrument is attached to an EM 550 communications buoy equipped 
with a YSI 1240 VHF radio transmitter.  The instrument is configured 
with the probes held at a depth of 1 meter below the surface. 

Site #2 Squamscott River (SQ)
Location
Mid channel of the Squamscott River at the Boston and Maine Railroad 
bridge, Stratham, NH.
Coordinates are 43°02' 30" N latitude and 70° 55' 20" W longitude
Salinity range: 0-30ppt (seasonally); 5-20 ppt from high to low tide
Temperature range: -1(C to 27(C (seasonally); difference of 0-5(from high to low 
Tide)
Depth: 3.5 meters at MLW
Tidal height of 2.7 m
Bottom type: Mud/oyster channel bottom
Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Exeter River, adjacent marshes
Pollutant influence: Urban storm water, agriculture, two municipal wastewater 
treatment plants, and residential septic systems

Deployment
The sonde is deployed in a perforated PVC cylinder attached to a piling at a 
fixed 0.5m height above the bottom and connected to a YSI 1240 radio transmitter 
mounted on the piling.

Site #3 Lamprey River (LR)
Location 
West bank of the tidal portion of the Lamprey River, approximately 300 m 
downstream of the dam at Route 108 in Newmarket, NH Coordinates are 43° 04' 48" 
N latitude and 70° 56' 04" W longitude 
Salinity range 0 to 27 (seasonally); difference of up to 15 ppt between high and 
low tides
Temperature range -1°C to 27°C (seasonally); difference of up to 5°C between 
high and low tides

Tidal height 2.7 m
Bottom type: mud/rock
Tidal velocity: maximum 40 cm/sec
Watershed: Lamprey River
Pollutant influence:  Urban storm water, adjacent marina, upstream and 
downstream wastewater treatment plants, and upstream agriculture

Deployment
The sonde is deployed in a perforated PVC cylinder attached to a piling at a 
fixed height of 0.5 m above the bottom connected to a YSI 1240 radio transmitter 
mounted on the piling. All files from this site in 2001 were obtained in the 
unattended mode. We could not get a line of sight between the sonde radio and 
the base station or the radio repeater station, possibly due to leaf coverage.

River

11. Data Anomalies:
Any anomalous or suspect data was removed from the data sets or retained and 
flagged as suspect, with explanations below. Anomalous data was the result of 
either fouling of the probes, probe failure, lack of communication between the 
1240 radio and the sonde, out of range data, or maintenance/calibration during 
which the sonde was in the lab. For all files, missing turbidity is not 
enumerated below.  There were very many noncontiguous points where the data was 
very much out of range (either negative, abnormally high, or greater than 1000 
NTU). All missing turbidity data was removed for this reason.



Squamscott River
(May 2 - Dec 6, 2001)

No data 5/1 0000 to 5/2 1700 sonde not yet deployed
No data 5/31 0730 to 2330 instrument did not record
No data 5/31 0330 instrument did not record
No data 6/1 0000 to 1230 sonde did not record for this period
No DO data 6/13 0430 and 6/14 2130 data out of range, deleted.
No DO data 7/12 1530 to 7/16 1030 data was out of range, possibly due to fouling 
at the end of the deployment, deleted.
Suspect DO data after 8/6 1400 higher than 120. These values are not normal and 
could 
be due to fouling of the membrane. Data was retained.
No data 8/31 1530 to 1600 out of water for end of deployment sonde swap.
No DO mg/L, salinity or sp. conductivity data 11/19 1400 to 11/22 0430, data out 
of range due to fouling of the Sp. Conductivity probe. DO mg/L was included in 
this deletion because readings for DO mg/L is temperature and salinity 
dependent. Therefore data were deleted. 
No salinity or sp. cond. Data 12/5 2330 to 12/6 1500 data out of range, deleted.  
No explanation for this aberrant data. Possible tampering.
No DO data 12/1 1430 to 12/6 1500 data out of range, deleted.
No data 12/6 1530 to 12/31 2330 sonde out for the winter.

Lamprey River
(May 2 - Dec 6, 2001)

No data 5/1 0000 to 5/2 1800 sonde not yet deployed
No data 5/17 1030 instrument out of the water for battery change
Anomalous DO data during much of May. Any data over 120% should be suspect. 
Possibly due to fouling of membrane. Data retained. 
No DO data 6/1 0000 to 1500  and 6/21 1330 to 6/22 1530 out of range probably 
due to fouling at the end of deployments, deleted.
7/8 2100 to 7/17 1800 Salinity and sp. cond.  data anomalous during this period. 
Typically salinity will fluctuate at this river in response to the tidal cycle. 
The data is suspect but retained.
Suspect very low DO values (less than 80) in the latter half of July. Possibly 
due to water in the sonde. Data was retained.
No data 7/27 1230 to 7/31 2330 When sonde was returned to the lab at the end of 
the deployment on Aug. 8, water was discovered in the battery compartment. Sonde 
did not record.
No data 8/1 0000 to 8/7 1600 water in battery compartment, sonde did not record.
No DO data 8/11 1500 to 8/12 0600 and 8/13 1600 to 8/30 1430 data out of range 
and deleted. Possible probe malfunction.
Salinity consistently high during the months of August, September, and October 
(through 10/12) due to the hot and dry season, resulting in little to no rain. 
No sal or sp. cond data 9/9 1930 to 9/13 0630. data extremely aberrant. It 
appeared that someone may have lifted the sonde from the water for 2 periods of 
time. Data deleted.
No DO data 9/13 0030 to 9/13 1400 very aberrant. Again it appeared that the 
sonde had been pulled from the water. Data deleted.
No pH data 9/13 0230 to 1330 out of range, same time period during which the 
sonde was possibly tampered with. Data deleted.
DO values drop at the end of the deployment (sonde swapped 9/19 1600.) Probably 
end of deployment fouling of membrane. Data was retained. 
No sal. or sp. cond. data 10/12 0400 to 10/13 0530 data out of normal range, 
deleted.
No DO or pH data 10/10 1300 to 1930 out of range, deleted.
No data 10/30 1430 to 10/31 2330 The sonde ran out of internal memory. At 
deployment calibration on 10/30 the software stated that 200 days of available 
memory remained. This clearly was not the case, so this was a software or 
equipment failure. No data for November or December for the same reason, since 
deployment was for the period 10/30 ­ 12/6.

Great Bay
(April 19 - Dec 13, 2001)

No data 4/1 0000 to 4/19 1230 sonde not yet deployed.
No depth data 4/1 0000 to 4/30 2330 no corresponding Squamscott depth data.
No DO data 4/25 1300 ­ 4/30 2330 out of range, possible probe malfunction, 
deleted.
No depth data 4/1 0000 to 5/2 1700 no corresponding Squamscott depth data.
No DO data 5/1 0000 to 5/2 1730 data out of range and deleted. Possible probe 
malfunction. Swapped instruments at this point.
No data 5/24 0400 ­ 5/30 1330. On the morning of the 25th it was discovered that 
the buoy to which the GB sonde is attached had broken free of its mooring. It 
drifted for several days before it was possible to find and retrieve it. The 
sonde did collect data during this period, but since it is not data from the GB 
site, it was deleted.
No depth data 5/31 0700 to 1600 and 1900 to 2330. No corresponding SQ data.
No depth data 6/1 0000 to 1200. No corresponding SQ data.
6/3 0300 to 6/11 1430 Anomalous salinity and specific conductivity data, too 
low, probably due to fouling of probe. Data was retained.
pH data 6/1 0000 to 6/11 1430 deleted due to fouling of probe. 
No DO data 7/4 1630 to 7/12 1100 out of range due to fouling. Data deleted.
DO, salinity, sp. cond. and pH data suspect 8/26 1100 to 8/31 2330. Out of 
range. 
When this instrument was retrieved on 9/4 water was found in battery compartment 
and communication port. Data was retained.
DO, salinity, sp. cond, pH suspect 9/1 0000 to 9/4 1400 out of range, possibly 
due to water in the sonde. Data was retained.
Between 10/14 and 10/17 the values for salinity and specific conductivity drop 
dramatically. This is due to 4 days of heavy rain during that period. The data 
is correct.
No pH data 11/29 15:30 to 11/30 2330 data out of range, possibly due to probe 
failure, deleted.
Suspect DO values in November until 11/29 1530. The values aren't out of range 
but are abnormally high for the site. Possibly probe malfunction because post 
deployment %DO was high. Data was retained.
No data 12/4 1500 datalogger replaced.
No pH data 12/1 0000 to 12/4 1430. Values were extremely low, out of range, 
possible due to probe malfunction.
No depth data 12/6 1500 to 12/13 1200 No corresponding SQ data.
No data 12/13 1230 to 12/31 2330 Sonde removed for the winter.


12. Missing Data:
All missing data is noted with a period (.). Data are missing due to equipment 
failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of equipment, 
elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to calibration 
problems, (both pre and post). For more details on the deleted data, see the 
Data Anomalies Section. To find out more details about missing data, please 
contact the research technician at the Great Bay site.


13. Post deployment information

14. Other remarks/ Notes

	The Great Bay sampling site has a substantial amount of fresh water 
discharge flowing into the bay during the spring months, hence the slow increase 
in salinity April to May. During March 2001 New Hampshire had a record snowfall.  
It is not unusual to see these low salinity values in the spring as the fresh 
water is discharged into the bay after winters with high snowfall, then the 
gradual increase in salinity over the late spring and summer.
