2) Entry Verification Process:

The data are uploaded using the computer program EcoWatch that accompanies the 
YSI 6000 series dataloggers.  After the file is uploaded from the water quality 
instrument, EcoWatch is used to plot the data and perform basic statistical 
analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.dev.).  This information is printed out 
and attached to the Field Log for the particular deployment. This printout is 
used during file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when 
the water quality instrument was removed from the water or those caused 
by instrument failure. The data are exported as a .csv file and then opened 
into a Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative 
recordings. When a complete month of data has been recorded the 
file is then reviewed.  The first step is to format the data so that the 
parameter columns are in the correct order and the data have the correct number 
of decimal place holders. The CDMO 5.0 Excel macro is used to check for any 
dates and times that data were not recorded due to maintenance, battery 
failure, or other causes. Missing dates and times are inserted into the file 
and a period is inserted into the cells where data would normally be. An 
explanation for the missing data is recorded onto the Water Quality Editing 
Log.  Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro to find readings outside 
the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range for the site in 
question. Data outside the instrument range are removed from the file 
and a period is inserted into the cell(s).  An explanation for the missing 
dates and times are recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside 
the "normal" range of water quality for a particular site were investigated for 
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks, PC6000 
printouts, and instrument diagnostics. If the data are rejected from the file a 
period is inserted into the cell(s) and an explanation for the missing dates 
and times are recorded onto metadata form.  The metadata form is then 
submitted with the data files to the CDMO.  Paula May, Research Biologist, was 
responsible for data management during 2002.  


3) Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island and Zeke's 
Island components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve and 
are anchored to the bottom of the selected sites.  Measurements are taken at 
30-minute intervals for approximately two-week periods. These sites are 
relatively unimpacted by manmade perturbations and are considered long term 
monitoring locations.  The goal is to establish long-term water quality 
monitoring at relatively unimpacted sites by collecting data for each day of the 
year. 


4) Research Methods:

The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March 1992 at the 
Research Creek site of the Masonboro Island component.  A second Masonboro 
Island site (Loosin Creek) was added on 26 February 2002.  Data collection 
started on 19 May 1994 at the Zeke's Island component (East Cribbings) and an 
additional site (Zeke's Basin) was added 1 March 2002.  The procedures described 
below were instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover data recorded 
previously. At this time we are only performing long term water quality 
monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6600 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is performed 
following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual addendum 7/94, sections 
3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are only required for pH, turbidity and 
salinity; all other parameters are done as described in the manual.  Buffer 
solutions for a two-point pH calibration (pH 7 and 10) are purchased pre-made 
from a scientific supply house. The conductivity standard is obtained from YSI. 
The dissolved oxygen membranes are replaced before deployment and are allowed 
to settle at least 24 hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are recorded in the 
field observation log. The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked 
steel cage, then anchored approximately 10cm off the bottom, and chained to a 
post at the monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling period 
measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration, depth, pH, and 
turbidity, and occasionally chlorophyll. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is brought back to 
the laboratory.  The weather and water quality measurements are again noted in 
the field observation log. The calibration drift and the effect of biofouling 
on the water quality instrument are checked by comparing data readings in 
calibration standards. The water quality data are then uploaded, and the 
instrument is cleaned and calibrated as noted previously. 


5) Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(from north to south) are: Currituck Banks, Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and 
Zeke's Island. They are located along the southeastern coast of the United 
States in the Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro Island and 
Zeke's Island components are transferred to the CDMO. 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The first Masonboro Island site (formerly called Masonboro Island (MS)) is 0.72 
km north east from the mouth of Whiskey Creek, and east of the Intracoastal 
Waterway (ICW), in a small navigable channel called Research Creek at 34° 
09'21.7" latitude and 77° 50'59.9" longitude. The site has a salinity range from 
18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 meters.  The creek bottom is 
characterized by sand and detritus based sediment with areas of soft mud with a 
depth ranging from 0.34 to 2.45 m.  The sole source of freshwater is rain.  
Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, which is relatively unimpacted 
by manmade perturbations and it is not accessible to road traffic.  The site 
does experience minimal boat traffic.  

2. Loosin Creek, Masonboro Island
The second Masonboro Island site (added in 2002) is 1.2 km east of the ICW, and 
2.5 km south west of Masonboro Inlet, in a small navigable channel called Loosin 
Creek at 34° 10'20.0" latitude and 77° 49'58.1" longitude. The site has a 
salinity range from 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 1.7 meters.  The 
creek bottom is characterized by sand and detritus based sediment with areas of 
soft mud with a depth ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 m.  The sole source of freshwater 
is rain.  Spartina spp. marsh and dunes surround the site, which is relatively 
unimpacted by manmade perturbations and it is not accessible to road traffic.  
The site does experience minimal boat traffic.    

3. East Cribbings, Zeke's Island
The first Zeke's Island site (formerly called Zeke's Island (ZI)) is located 1.8 
km south of Federal Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33° 56'23.5" 
latitude and 77° 56'28.1" longitude. This site receives minimal freshwater input 
from leakage of the Cape Fear River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separates 
the two bodies of water.  The site has a salinity range from 15-35 ppt and a 
tidal range that averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found 
to range from 0.11 to 2.30 meters.  Bottom type substratum consists of large 
rocks (the cribbings) with sand and detritus based sediment.  There are no 
pollutants from land.  Marsh and dunes surround the site; not accessible to road 
traffic and minimal boat traffic.

4. Zeke's Basin, Zeke's Island
The second Zeke's Island site (added in 2002) is located 0.8 km south east of 
the Federal Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33° 57'17.0" latitude 
and 77° 56'6.0" longitude. This site receives minimal freshwater input from 
leakage of the Cape Fear River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separates the 
two bodies of water.  The site has a salinity range from 11-35 ppt and a tidal 
range that averages 2 meters.  Depth varies, but typically it can be found to 
range from 0.1 to 2 meters. Bottom type substratum consists of sand and detritus 
based sediment with a layer of soft sulfuric mud.  There are no pollutants from 
land.  Marsh and dunes surround the site; not accessible to road traffic and 
minimal boat traffic.

 

6) Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992 while monitoring of Loosin 
Creek started on 26 February 2002.  East Cribbing data collection commenced on 
19 May 1994 and Zeke's Basin data collection began on 1 March 2002.  All 
monitoring is considered long term.

An asterisk (*) at the end of a deployment period indicates that a YSI 6600 EDS 
sonde was used for that particular deployment.  YSI 6600s were utilized for all 
other deployments. All sondes are equipped with non-vented depth sensor and 
identical probe models.

11) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section lists and explains all anomalous (suspect) data that has either 
been deleted or still remains in the data set.  The data are either extreme for 
the aquatic system being monitored or are outside the measurement range of the 
instrument. The cause of such anomalies may be a bad calibration, boat traffic 
disturbances, malfunction of the instrument, or the measurements may be 
correct.


Research Creek, January

All parameters missing due to sonde exchange on the following date and time.
01/10/02 15:00:00

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensors 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is 
covered by sediment, or if a fish or crab gets caught in the probe guard cup.  
The small negative turbidity values could be a result of the probe's resolution 
or contamination of the zero standard when the probe was calibrated.

Research Creek, February
No missing or anomalous data to report.   

Research Creek, March

During the following dates specific conductivity, DO, turbidity and pH all seem 
to be responding to something, possibly caused by sulfuric sediment and 
fouling.   When the sonde was retrieved, it was covered with sediment and 
algae, and smelled of sulfur.  In the presence of sulfur, the DO probe will not 
work properly.  Sensors tested OK during post deployment calibration check.  
Data were removed.

Research Creek, April

During the following dates specific conductivity, DO, turbidity and pH all seem 
to be responding to something, possibly caused by sulfuric sediment and 
fouling.   When the sonde was retrieved, it was covered with sediment and 
algae, and smelled of sulfur.  In the presence of sulfur, the DO probe will not 
work properly.  Sensors tested OK during post deployment calibration check.  
Data were removed.

This site's benthic environment is characterized by sulfuric sediment.  It is 
common to find the deployment structure or sonde stained with black markings 
and smelling of sulfur.  The presence of hydrogen sulfide interferes with the 
function of the DO probe and is likely the cause of erratic and/or very low 
(including negative) values for dissolved oxygen that are prevalent at this 
site.

range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is 
covered by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.  The 
small negative turbidity values could be a result of the probe's resolution or 
contamination of the zero standard when the probe was calibrated.

Zeke's Basin, July

This site's benthic environment is characterized by sulfuric sediment.  It is 
common to find the deployment structure or sonde stained with black markings 
and smelling of sulfur.  The presence of hydrogen sulfide interferes with the 
function of the DO probe and is likely the cause of erratic and/or very low 
(including negative) values for dissolved oxygen that are prevalent at this 
site.

DO data for the following dates and times should be considered suspect due to 
compromised DO membrane integrity at some point during the deployment.

Zeke's Basin, August

This site's benthic environment is characterized by sulfuric sediment.  It is 
common to find the deployment structure or sonde stained with black markings 
and smelling of sulfur.  The presence of hydrogen sulfide interferes with the 
function of the DO probe and is likely the cause of erratic and/or very low 
(including negative) values for dissolved oxygen that are prevalent at this 
site.  
DO data for the following dates and times should be considered suspect due to 
compromised DO membrane integrity at some point during the deployment.
08/01/02 00:00 - 08/02/02 15:00

DO data were deleted for the following periods due to probe failure while 
deployed.
08/27/02 04:00 - 08/31/02 23:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is 
covered by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.  The 
small negative turbidity values could be a result of the probe's resolution or 
contamination of the zero standard when the probe was calibrated.

Zeke's Basin, September

This site's benthic environment is characterized by sulfuric sediment.  It is 
common to find the deployment structure or sonde stained with black markings 
and smelling of sulfur.  The presence of hydrogen sulfide interferes with the 
function of the DO probe and is likely the cause of erratic and/or very low 
(including negative) values for dissolved oxygen that are prevalent at this 
site.  DO data for the following dates should be considered suspect.
09/09/02 11:30 - 09/24/02 04:30

DO data were deleted for the following periods due to probe failure while 
deployed.
09/01/02 0:00 - 09/09/02 11:00

DO data were deleted for the following period due to a membrane puncture at the 
end of the deployment.
09/24/02 03:30 - 10:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is 
covered by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.  The 
small negative turbidity values could be a result of the probe's resolution or 
contamination of the zero standard when the probe was calibrated.

Zeke's Basin, October

This site's benthic environment is characterized by sulfuric sediment.  It is 
common to find the deployment structure or sonde stained with black markings 
and smelling of sulfur.  The presence of hydrogen sulfide interferes with the 
function of the DO probe and is likely the cause of erratic and/or very low 
(including negative) values for dissolved oxygen that are prevalent at this 
site.  DO values for the following dates and times were slightly negative and 
should be considered suspect.

During the following periods the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The small negative turbidity values could be a 
result of the probe's resolution or contamination of the zero standard when the 
probe was calibrated.

Zeke's Basin, December

All parameters are missing data due to a sonde shortage.
12/17/02 10:00 - 12/18/02 09:30

During the following dates the turbidity data were outside of the sensor's 
range.  The data were retained.  The high value reflects the turbid conditions 
that occur during heavy rainfall and high wind events, when the probe is 
covered by sediment, or if a fish gets caught in the probe guard cup.

12/29/2002	02:30:00	1020

Data were deleted for the following period due to the sonde being exposed 
periodically at low tide.
12/30/02 00:00 - 12/31/02 23:30


12) Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, and elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, 
see the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14) Notes:

High turbidity values above instruments top range (1000 NTU), caused by 
blockage of light transmittance by an obstruction are left in the file.

Whenever specific conductivity or salinity data (referred to as conductivity 
data) were suspect, consider DO data in mg/l and depth suspect as well, since 
specific conductivity is used to calculate depth and DO data in mg/l.

Negative or zero depth readings were not deleted because the salinity and DO 
readings indicated that the sonde was submerged during these periods.
