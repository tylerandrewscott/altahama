2. Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a PC from the YSI 6000/6600 UPG data logger and graphs 
are produced and quickly examined using the PC6000 software.  Data files are 
then exported from the PC6000 format into Excel (for Windows 98) files where the 
headers, footers, and inappropriate spaces are removed.  Plots of the data are 
made and suspect data (outliers) are dealt with accordingly.  Removed data 
points and missing data are replaced with a periods (.).  Edited files are 
merged to contain one full month for each data logger.  Data is then QA/QC'd 
using the cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros and Appendix B., YSI 6000 Data Review and 
Editing Protocol. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro will allow the user to 
automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places based 
on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger 
generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data 
with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the 
data logger is designed to measure (outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel file 
from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In addition, in 
November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro allowing users to 
produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a monthly basis. Marta 
Ceroni and Pamela Behm were both responsible for the collection and QA/QC 
procedures for this data. 


3. Research Objectives
The purpose of the monitoring program at CBM NERR is to conform to the NERR SWMP 
monitoring program looking at trends in water quality over both temporal and 
spatial scales.  A difference in how marshes can change water quality is being 
studied by comparing a marsh creek site to a river channel site.  Measurements 
are taken every 30 minutes over a 5-14 day period at both the Patuxent River 
Park (PR) and Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) sites.  

4. Research methods (YSI data loggers)
Three to four data loggers (2 YSI 6000 sondes/2 YSI 6600 sondes) were rotated 
throughout the data collection period.  One YSI 6000 sonde was removed from 
rotation on 8/24/01 due to internal errors that caused the sonde to malfunction.  

Patuxent River:  Each YSI data logger is laid down on a 4" diameter PVC pipe 
that has been cut in half.  The PVC is nailed to a 4"x 4" block of wood which is 
secured to a crab pot.  The crab pot with the data logger in it sits on the 
bottom at both sites.  The crab pot is locked to a pier.  The YSI probes sit 
approximately 6" above the sediment.  

Jug Bay:  The same type of cage as PR (converted crab pot) was used from 4/27 - 
9/03.  Due to deterioration of the crab pot, a new cage was installed 
temporarily 9/03.  The temporary cage was constructed of a wooden frame with 
galvanized steel netting wrapped around the frame (dimensions:  approximately 
40" L x 10" H x 12" W).  The data logger was laid down on a 4" diameter PVC pipe 
that was cut in half.  The PVC was nailed to a 4"x 4" block of wood and placed in 
the bottom of the cage.  The final cage was installed 10/19/01.  This cage was a 
converted raccoon trapping cage (32" L x 12.25" H x 10" W) in which the data 
logger was suspended horizontally in a galvanized metal pipe approximately 15.3" 
in length and 4" in diameter.  The pipe was held suspended about 5" from the 
bottom of the cage by 4 cables.  The cage was stabilized in the water column by 
attaching a 5-pound weight at each end of the bottom of the cage.  The cage is 
locked to a pier.  The YSI probes sit approximately 7" above the sediment.  

Every 30 minutes up to a two-week period, measurements for specific 
conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, 
turbidity and water level are recorded.  Within 14 days of deployment, the data 
is downloaded and either newly calibrated probes are installed or a new YSI unit 
with calibrated probes are placed at each site.  Calibration procedures are 
carried out according to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual.

5. Site location and character
The Chesapeake Bay Maryland NERR has three components in Maryland's portion of 
Chesapeake Bay.  Monie Bay is a mesohaline region on the lower Eastern Shore; 
Otter Point Creek is a tidal freshwater river and marsh system; and Jug Bay is 
part of the freshwater portion of the Patuxent River.  Both data loggers are 
within the Jug Bay component.

Patuxent River Park (PR) – (38 deg 46' 23.5"N/76 deg 42' 32.5"W)  Site PR is located in the 
upper tidal headwaters of the Patuxent River, Maryland.  PR is along the 
mainstem of the Patuxent River, which is approximately 50m wide at this point 
along the river.  The PR site sits adjacent to a boat launch at Jackson Landing, 
located on the Prince Georges County side of the river at Patuxent River Park.  
The actual sonde is deployed horizontally in a retro-fitted crab pot and sits 
roughly .25m off the bottom sediments.  Sediments at the site are extremely fine 
and easily resuspended.  Average depth at this site is roughly 2 meters.  
Salinities at this site rarely exceed 1ppt.  Because this site is located along 
the main channel of the Patuxent River, water quality at this site represents 
the general quality of water flowing along the main portion of the river.  The 
Patuxent River watershed is an increasingly urbanized watershed, however there 
are extensive riparian buffers along the portion of the river that flows through 
the site.  However, the PR site is approximately 3km downstream of a large 
wastewater treatment plant that discharges directly into the Western Branch 
tributary of the Patuxent River.   The PR site is roughly 1.5km downstream of 
the confluence of the Western Branch tributary and the Patuxent River mainstem.  
The tidal range at this site is roughly 0.5m.

Jug Bay (JB) – (38 deg 46' 5"N/76 deg 42' 28"W estimated)  Site JB is located in a shallow 
tidal creek adjacent to the Patuxent River.  The site is slightly upstream 
(roughly 0.3km) from the PR site but sits in shallow creek that is tidally 
infiltrated by a backwater marsh  adjacent to the Patuxent River mainstem.  At 
low tide, this backwater marsh becomes a large mud flat with very little 
standing water.  The creek ranges in width  between 2m to 5m at the site and 
average depth at the site is 0.75m.  Because of the shallow nature of this site, 
the sonde is periodically exposed at very low tides.  Sediments at this site are 
extremely fine and flocculant.  The sonde is deployed horizontally in a retro-
fitted cage, similar to site PR.  Because of the shallowness of the tidal creek, 
coupled with the dramatic daily changes in the depth and width of the stream, 
deployments at this site have presented some problems.  These problems include 
periodic exposure of the sonde, very high turbidity and sedimentation rates 
associated with tidal infiltration and resuspension, which have caused severe 
fouling of the probes at this site.  Water quality at the site represents 
extreme shallow water habitats.  Thus it is not uncommon to see very large 
fluctuations in temperature and dissolved oxygen at this site ranging from 
complete anoxia to full saturation, due in part to the shallow nature of the 
site and the effects of marsh processes on water quality.  Salinities at this 
site rarely exceed 1 ppt.  Tidal range at this site is roughly 0.5m



6. Data collection period
Data loggers initiated collection in April 2001 and continued through the end of 
November 2001, at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) and Patuxent River Park (PR). 
Sondes were deployed from April through November 2001 due to concerns with ice 
cover that prohibited deployment during the winter months. The time of 
deployment and retrieval was not documented in the field, therefore only dates 
are given for those instances when the time was unknown.

11. Data anomalies:
Note: Turbidity data is incomplete and suspect for both PR and JB.  A new YSI 
6600 data logger, complete with turbidity probe, was put in rotation on 8/02/01.  
This was the only turbidity probe in rotation between JB and PR.  There was no 
turbidity probe installed at either site prior to this date.  However, 
calibration procedures for this probe were unclear and technicians were not 
trained on the proper usage of this probe (i.e. a clear beaker was used for 
calibration).  As such, all turbidity data is suspect.  All obvious turbidity 
outliers were removed, as reported below in section 12.

December
No data collected entire month. 


12. Missing data: 
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems.  Outliers were removed throughout the 
2001 time period and are believed to be the result of internal data logger 
error.  For more details on deleted data, see the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  
To find out more details about missing data, contact the Research Coordinator at 
the site submitting the data.  

13.  Post deployment information
Calibration was not performed during post deployment because this procedure was 
not included in training of research technicians.  Therefore, technicians were 
not aware of or trained for post deployment calibration.
