2.  Entry verification:
Data are downloaded from the YSI Model 6000 or YSI Model 6600 sondes to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat) to a PC located at the reserve 
laboratory. Graphs are produced from the .dat files using the Eco-Watch 
application supplied by YSI and examined for obvious sensor failure, using the 
suggested data analysis protocol provided to the NERRS by YSI. A post-deployment 
check is run on the sondes to determine if there is significant sensor drift 
(>10%) due to biofouling. Fouling of sensors is detected by 1) visual inspection 
of the instrument, 2) post-deployment measurements taken using calibration 
standards, and 3) by comparing final measurements of a given deployment with 
initial measurements of the succeeding deployment.

Sea-truthing was conducted by measuring water quality with an additional 
datalogger taking real-time measurements at the time of deployment.  The data 
were recorded either using the YSI 610-DM model data recorder attached by cable 
to a sonde or the hand-held YSI 556-MPS datalogger. Values for temperature, 
salinity, DO mg/L, pH, and time were recorded real-time for both surface and 
bottom measurements at each deployment site.  Depth measurements were available 
directly from the YSI 610-DM but were estimated using a weighted, nylon braid 
line marked at 0.5 meter intervals when the YSI 556-MPS was employed for sea-
truthing.  The preparation and post-deployment procedures for the data logger 
used in sea-truthing follows the same general procedure as that for data loggers 
used in deployments, and is the responsibility of the reserve technicians.

The comma-delimited files are imported into Excel 2002 and a printed version is 
produced to aid in the QA/QC process. The file is processed using macros 
supplied by the CDMO which are designed to: 1) check data files for missing data 
points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods (.), 3) convert 
the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, date and numeric 
variables, 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range for the sensors and 
write the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) save the files as 
Excel worksheets (*.xls).  The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether 
to flag or delete the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) 
outside the range expected for the site (see Section 5, Site Location and 
Character), 2) outside the range of measurements and accuracy established for 
the sensors (Part II, Section 8: Variable Sequence, Range of Measurements, 
Units, Resolution, and Accuracy section), or 3) outside the range established 
for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen <4 mg/L).  Data are 
deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor malfunction, or 2) 
significant fouling of sensors by marine organisms. After appropriate 
corrections or deletions are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the files are 
exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt).  Robin Weber was responsible for these 
tasks.

3.  Research Objectives:
YSI 6600 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve's (NERR) System Wide Water 
Quality Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to develop long-term data sets 
for representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality 
over  time. Because Prudence Island is located in the geographic center of 
Narragansett Bay, it is an ideal location for monitoring the status and trends 
in water quality in the Bay over time. One NERR water quality monitoring station 
has been established at Potter's Cove, on the island's northeastern shore.  This 
area is impacted by boat traffic and storm runoff from mainland urban and 
residential areas. The second NERR water quality monitoring station, T-Wharf, is 
situated on the southeastern shore of the island, facing the open waters of 
Rhode Island Sound. It is approximately 6 miles south of the Potter's Cove site. 
Boat traffic is sparse at this site and storm runoff is less likely to have a 
significant impact on water quality. A third monitoring site was added in March 
2002.  This monitoring site is located in Nag Creek, a salt marsh tidal creek 
which flows into the West Passage of Narragansett Bay.  The addition of this 
site completes our representation of dominant habitat types occurring in 
Narragansett Bay (i.e. marsh, cove, and open water).  In July of 2002, the T-
Wharf monitoring station was replaced with two new monitoring sites located a 
short distance from the original T-Wharf location.  The new stations are 
situated on either side of a wharf support piling.  One datalogger records water 
quality near the surface while the second records water quality parameters 
approximately 0.5 meters off the bottom.  This allows for the identification of  
both the frequency and duration of any stratification which may occur in the 
open waters of Narragansett Bay.  The Narragansett Bay water quality monitoring 
program began in December, 1995 at Potter's Cove and in September, 1996 at T-
Wharf. (see Section 5, Site Location and Character section for description of 
sites).  YSI electronic data loggers were deployed to measure the water 
temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth, and turbidity 
conditions at 30-minute intervals. With the exception of the T-Wharf Surface 
site, all dataloggers are deployed approximately 0.5 meters off the bottom.  

4.  Research Methods
One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in Narragansett 
Bay. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on 
the season, and measurements are taken every 30 minutes. The monitoring station 
at Potter's Cove was constructed in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted 
vertically on a piling located approximately 6 feet west of a floating dock.  To 
facilitate water flow across the sensors, openings are cut into the PVC pipes.  
The pipes are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are less than 1 meter 
from the bottom.  In 1996, the T-Wharf station was put into service: the PVC 
pipe is mounted on a piling attached to a pier. The two replacement T-Wharf 
sites (surface and bottom) are also deployed in PVC pipes mounted to a piling.  
The datalogger at the T-Wharf surface station is maintained just below the 
surface by means of a buoy attached by rope to the adjacent wharf.  At this time 
a maintenance schedule was adopted whereby the pipes are cleaned monthly with a 
chimney brush during the summer to reduce the impact of biofouling on the data.  
The Nag Creek datalogger was originally deployed in a metal cage which was 
tethered to the bank.  A permanent deployment structure was installed 12/31/02 
and consists of a 4 by 4 pressure-treated post with a hinged 2 by 4 horizontal 
arm.  At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are retrieved and 
freshly cleaned and calibrated instruments are deployed. The retrieved data 
loggers are brought back to the laboratory, post deployment evaluations of the 
instrument are carried out, and the device is cleaned, calibrated, and serviced 
by methods outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual. After cleaning the 
data loggers, the pH, salinity, depth, and turbidity sensors are calibrated, 
using the following standards: pH 7 and 10, salinity standard of 30.36 ppt or 
specific conductivity standard of 50.00 mS/cm, depth in the air, and turbidity 
standards of 0 and 100 NTU, respectively.  The dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is 
replaced and allowed to stretch for a minimum of 24 hours before the DO sensor 
is calibrated in water-saturated air. The sonde is programmed to begin taking 
measurements approximately 12 hours in advance of planned deployment, allowing 
the DO membrane to stabilize. The file is checked for DO sensor drift before the 
DO probe is calibrated. Calibration of the dissolved oxygen sensor is usually 
done within 2 hours of deployment.

Dissolved Oxygen Survey - Under the direction of Dr. Christopher Deacutis, 
NBNERR Research Coordinator, with volunteers from the R.I. Dept. of 
Environmental Management, Roger Williams University, the University of Rhode 
Island, Brown University, the Environmental Protection Agency offices in 
Narragansett, RI and Lexington, MA, the Massachusetts Coastal Zoning Management 
Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Narragansett Bay Commission, Save 
the Bay, Yellow Springs Instruments, and NBNERR staff. The goal of the survey is 
to take discrete samples within the water column (surface, bottom, and every 1.5 
meters of depth) at more than 75 stations in the Narragansett Bay. These surveys 
are performed overnight during neap tide. The project began in 1999, and takes 
place at least twice during the summer. The data will be used to map dissolved 
oxygen levels bay-wide and help to identify sites at risk for hypoxic and anoxic 
events. Inquiries should be directed to Dr. Deacutis at the RIDEM, Dept. of 
Water Resources, 235 Promenade St., Providence RI 02908, tel. (401) 222-4700

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.

There was a discontinuity in DO% (and DO mg/L) between all deployments this 
month.  I suspect that this occurrence may be related to the high variability in 
the data during this time of the year rather than poor performance of the 
probes.

The specific conductivity probe did not function properly during the start of 
the 4/25/02 and 5/29/02 deployments due to operator error.  Data for specific conductivity and salinity were removed from the beginning of the month through 5/07/02 at 16:00:00.  Data for specific conductivity and salinity were also removed from the start of the 5/29/02 13:30:00 deployment through the end of the month.  (Refer to notes in Section 14 regarding specific conductivity measurements at this deployment location.)

DO% and DO mg/L were removed for the entire 6/13/02 (6/13 09:30:00 to 6/27/02 
09:00:00) deployment.  There was a definite membrane puncture upon retrieval but 
it would appear from the discontinuity between previous and subsequent 
deployments that the entire deployment was bad.  The membrane puncture occurred 
6/20/02 at 13:30:00 (based on a steep rise in DO charge).  However, it seems 
likely that the membrane was compromised after calibration and prior to 
deployment so the entire sampling period was removed.

Specific conductivity and salinity data were removed from the start of the month 
through 6/05/02 at 4:00:00.  The probe did not appear to be functioning 
properly. (See Section 14e)

Slight discontinuity in specific conductivity and salinity data occurred at the 
start of the 6/13/02 and 6/27/02 deployments.  No data were removed.

Dissolved Oxygen values for deployment 06/27/02 13:00:00 through 07/12/02 11:30:00 suspect due to possible probe failure. Post deployment membrane integrity test failed. Data retained because it wasn't clear as to whether these values were caused by probe failure or not.

Data missing 7/24/02 9:30:00 during sonde changeover.

The time stamp for the 7/24/02 deployment time was off by 1 minute, corrected to 
read on the hour and half hour.

High turbidity values ( > 750 NTU) occurred on the following date and time:
7/03/2002 	13:30:00 

Turbidity reported negative and/or zero values through the month.

DO levels were low for the entire 7/9/02 (to 7/24/02) deployment.  There was 
also a small discontinuity in depth between deployments and this may account for 
the lower values.  The data appear acceptable, however they may need some 
correction to account for the difference in depth in order to be more 
informative.

Specific conductivity and salinity data were removed from the start of the 
7/12/02 12:00:00 deployment through 7/20/02 at 3:00:00. (See Section 14e)

What appears to be a discontinuity in depth between samples occurring early in 
the month versus late in the month is a function of the difference in tidal 
range rather than a discontinuity between deployments.  

TS
Data missing through 7/12/02 at 10:00:00. First deployment at this location 
begins 7/12/02 at 10:30:00.

Time stamp for the 7/24/02 - 8/8/02 deployment was off by one minute.  The time 
stamp was corrected to read on the hour and half hour.

Turbidity reported negative and/or zero values through the month.

Supersaturation measurements for dissolved oxygen (> 120 %) were noted for the 
following date and times:
7/31/2002	11:30:00, 13:30:00-20:30:00, 22:30:00-23:30:00

Slight change in depth on 07/21/02 is probably a result of the sonde getting 
caught up in the rope and buoy which suspend it at the surface.  The depth 
change was not considered sufficient to alter the recorded data samples.

TB
Data missing through 7/3/02 at 11:00:00.  First deployment at this location 
begins 7/3/02 at 11:30:00.

Time stamp was off by 00:01:00 for the 7/3/02 deployment. The data were 
corrected to read on the hour and half hour.

Missing data 7/9/02 11:30:00.  The sonde was pulled to switch out the specific 
conductivity probe.  It appeared from a previous deployment that this probe was 
not functioning properly.  Specific conductivity data should be considered 
suspect for the deployment prior to the probe replacement although there is no 
obvious problem with the data.  The sonde was only at the lab long enough to 
change out this one probe so it was returned to the site and considered a 
continuous deployment.

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.

Anomalous turbidity values (737 NTU) deleted on the following date and time because this one spike is not representative of the site on a yearly basis:

August 1 - 31, Sampling period
PC
Missing data on 8/20/02 at 11:30:00 and 12:00:00.  The PVC pipe in which the 
sonde is deployed was changed from a 4" diameter pipe to a 6" diameter pipe. The 
location for deployment at Potter's Cove did not change.  However, there is a 
slight discontinuity in depth (the new position is slightly shallower than the 
old position by approximately 0.3 m).  The entire 8/8/02 deployment appears to 
be very shallow and suggests that the sonde was caught up on growth in the old 
pipe and demonstrates the necessity of changing the PVC pipe at this time.

Missing data on 8/21/02 at 9:00:00 during sonde changeover.

Turbidity reported negative and/or zero values through the month.

Specific Conductivity and salinity suspect towards the end of deployments 02A0229A (07/30/02 10:00:00 through 08/14/02 10:30:00) and 01E0876AB (08/14/02 11:00 through 08/30/02 10:30:00) due to biofouling of the sensors.  

DO values at the end of the 8/14/02 deployment (8/22/02 21:00:00 - 8/30/02 
10:30:00) were deleted. The post deployment calibration check demonstrated that the probe was reading very low (DO% = 25.9), possibly due to the beginning of a membrane puncture or growth on the membrane.  The previous deployment (7/30/02) also had heavy growth but there was no corresponding drop-off in values for DO. There was slight discontinuity between the 7/30/02 and 8/14/02 deployments and a large discontinuity between the 8/14/02 and 8/30/02 deployments.

There was some discontinuity in specific conductivity between the 8/21/02 and 
9/6/02 deployments.  Slight drift seems likely.

The dip in salinity between 9/23/02 21:30:00 and 9/28/02 3:00:00 is probably a 
result of a heavy rainfall (25.7 mm) event on 9/23/02 and appears to be valid.

Low salinity values from 9/16/02 4:30:00 to 9/16/02 16:00:00 corresponds to a 
heavy rainfall (22.4 mm) event occurring at low tide and is therefore considered 
valid.

Specific conductivity and salinity data were removed from the start of the 
9/19/02 10:00:00 deployment through 9/23/02 at 22:30:00. (See Section 14e) 
Salinity at this time is still lower than values at the end of the month, 
however there was significant rainfall (25.7 mm) on this day, which suggests 
that these values are valid.

Missing data for 9/27/02 at 9:00:00 during sonde changeover.

Turbidity reported negative and/or zero values through the month.

The post deployment calibration check suggests that heavy growth on the probes 
may have compromised the data at the end of the 8/21/02 deployment.  This was a 
long deployment (> 3 weeks) for this time of year.  Turbidity values were very 
high beginning 9/07/02 at 13:00:00 through the end of the deployment (9/13/02 
9:00:00).  Discontinuities in specific conductivity and DO also occurred between 
the 8/21/02 and 9/13/02 deployments. pH post-calibration was significantly low 
at retrieval. Although no data were removed all parameters should be considered 
suspect.

Salinity values drop off between 9/11/02 2:00:00 through 9/12/02 18:30:00 with a 
great deal of variation during this time period.  This is likely a result of 
high winds from the remnant of Hurricane Gustov which passed through the area at 
this time.

There was a large discontinuity in specific conductivity and salinity at the 
start of the 11/15/02 deployment.  Although the entire deployment might be 
considered suspect because data values are consistently lower than the previous

12.  Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14.  Other Remarks/Notes
a) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. There were a few instances at this NERR 
site where turbidity recorded small negative values (-0001). Because turbidity 
has a range of accuracy of +/-2 NTU, the technician did not edit or deleted 
these values in any way. 


b.) After the installation of the two new T-Wharf monitoring stations (TS and 
TB), the data collection at the original site (TW) was continued for a period of 
weeks.  This will allow investigators to evaluate how the new stations compare 
to the original site data.  It should be noted that the TW data for this time 
period displays a greater amount of variation due to biofouling in the old PVC 
pipe in which it was deployed (versus the clean PVC pipe environment of the new 
stations).

c.) Slight depth anomalies frequently occur at the Nag Creek deployment 
location.  This was a result of deploying the sonde in a non-fixed structure.  
The sonde was suspended horizontally from the inside top of a cage which was 
tethered to the bank.  During retrieval and subsequent deployments the cage was 
not necessarily placed in the same location.  Although movement was not over a 
great distance (generally less than 1 meter), slight variations in depth 
occurred at deployment times.  Depth at this site was also influenced to some 
extent by changes in atmospheric pressure because the sonde was situated in very 
shallow waters.  

d.) The apparent failure of the specific conductivity probe at the start of many 
of the Nag Creek deployments, followed by a recovery of the probe to reasonable 
levels, is most likely a result of the deployment procedure at this site.  The 
tidal creek in which the sonde is deployed is too shallow to allow the sonde to 
be deployed vertically.   As a result, the sonde is suspended horizontally, 
which may allow air to become trapped in the specific conductivity probe.  The 
probe must be completely immersed in solution to function properly and the data 
suggests that this was not the case.  Data for specific conductivity and 
salinity were removed for all time periods in which the probe appeared to be 
impacted by trapped air.

e.) There were a greater number of discontinuities in DO at all sites during the 
summer months and throughout the year at Nag Creek.  Discontinuities are implied 
by a > 10 % change in recorded data values between the last sample of a 
deployment and the first sample of the subsequent deployment.  Due to a greater 
variation in DO levels during the summer, a > 10 % change is more likely to 
occur.  Discontinuities were not noted in instances when these appeared to be a 
result of variation in DO levels, following the same general pattern over time, 
rather than due to possible drift.
 
f.) Slight depth anomalies occurred at the T-Wharf surface monitoring station.  
The datalogger at this station was suspended from the bottom of a buoy attached 
by rope to the adjacent wharf.  On occasion it became apparent that the sonde 
and/or buoy had become caught up in the rope, but never to such an extent that 
the sonde came out of the water.  Wave action during periods of high winds may 
be responsible for some of the depth variation.  The sonde is attached to a 
float and is readily impacted.  Deployment near the surface also allows for 
depth measurements to be altered by changes in atmospheric pressure.  At no time 
were the variations in depth considered sufficient to alter the validity of the 
data.

g.) Throughout the year, and at different monitoring stations, entire 
deployments measured pH levels which were consistently higher and/or lower than 
surrounding deployments. Although not discontinuities per se because the 
differences are not significant, they become obvious when the data set is viewed 
over a long time period.  It should be noted that the pH probes responsible are 
calibrated properly and checked out well at post deployment.  It may be 
necessary to make corrections to the data to reflect more credible pH levels.  

h.)  During the month of September, filters for the generation of de-ionized 
water required replacement.  There was some delay in ordering/shipping, so the 
calibration of the turbidity probe was not accurate over a period of 2-3 weeks 
beginning mid-month.
