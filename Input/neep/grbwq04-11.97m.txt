2.  Entry verification
The data are uploaded to a Texas Instruments computer from the YSI dataloggers
using the PC6000 software. Files were also exported in a comma delimited format. 
The data is checked visually for any anomalous data points that may not be 
detected by the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros. Files are then transferred to a Macintosh 
computer and opened in Excel 5.0 software and edited. The data is checked 
according to the CDMO Operations Manual, version 3.0.  Missing data from YSI 
maintenance and other reasons are inserted into the spreadsheet and denoted by 
periods (.). Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data. 
Files are verified by means of CDMO Excel 5.0 macros.  Jaimie Wolf performs 
These tasks.

3.  Research Objectives
In 1997 YSI 6000 dataloggers were deployed in Great Bay and the Squamscott River 
As part of the National Estuarine Research Reserves¹ (NERR) Water Quality
Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop long-term datasets for representative
estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over time. The 
instruments were deployed for two weeks at a time, depending on season, and
measurements taken every 30 minutes.  The Squamscott River site is 
representative of tidal rivers with multiple pollution sources. The Great Bay 
reference site is considered relatively unimpacted.


4.  Research methods (YSI data loggers)
The data loggers were anchored to the bottom on fixed moorings at a distance of 
one meter from the bottom.  Every half hour over a two-week period, measurements 
of specific conductivity, salinity, percent saturation, dissolved oxygen, pH, 
temperature and water level were recorded.  At the end of the two-week period, 
the YSI data loggers were brought back to the Jackson Lab for downloading, 
cleaning and recalibration.  VWR conductivity and pH standards are used for 
calibration.  Formazin purchased from Hach is used to calibrate turbidity.  The 
procedures used in the YSI manual were used to verify that the sonde was reading 
correctly.  Ecowatch was used to check pre- and post-calibrations by using the 
diagnostics menu of the program.  Most datasondes are sending data in real time 
via radio transmission to the lab.  The real time data is checked daily to see 
if it appears correct or if the instrument needs to come in for calibration and 
cleaning.  The data loggers were then redeployed for another two-week period.

5.  Site location and character
The Great Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the northeastern
coast of the United States in the tidal estuary Great Bay in the southeastern 
part of New Hampshire.  In the year 1997 there were two sampling sites. 

Great Bay  (GB)
Central area of Great Bay proper.  The coordinates of the deployment are 
43°04¹20² latitude and 70°52¹10² longitude.
Salinity range: 5-32 ppt (seasonally); 0-5ppt from high to low tide.
Temperature range: -1°C to 27°C (seasonally); 0-3° from high to low tide
Depth: 5.5 meters at MLW
Tidal height of 2.7 meters
Bottom type: Mud and rock channel bottom
Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Squamscott, Lamprey and Winnicut Rivers plus smaller streams. High
tide influence from Little Bay and associated rivers
Pollutant influence: clean reference site

Squamscott River (SQ)
Mid channel in the Squamscott River, 300 m north of the Route 108 bridge.
Coordinates are 43°02¹30² latitude and 70°55¹20² longitude
Salinity range: 0-30ppt (seasonally); 5-20 ppt from high to low tide
Temperature range: -1°C to 28°C (seasonally); 0-5° from high to low tide
Depth: 3.5 meters at MLW
Tidal height of 2.7 m
Bottom type: Mud channel bottom
Tidal velocity: maximum 50 cm/sec
Watersheds: Exeter River, adjacent marshes
Pollutant influence: Urban stormwater, agriculture, two municipal wastewater
treatment plants, residential septic systems

6.  Data collection period
Great Bay data collection began April 3, 1997.  Squamscott River data collection
began July 21, 1997.  The data loggers had been removed from the water during 
the winter months due to icing.

7.  Associated researchers and projects
Great Bay Monitoring Project - Dr. Richard Langan. Supported by NOAA/NERR.
Physical, chemical and biological indices of estuarine conditions.

Howell.  Ten years of studies supported by USDA and Sea Grant that track lobster
abundance, movement and behavior in relation to physical and biological 
variables in the Great Bay Estuary.

Eelgrass modeling studies: Supported by NOAA/COP.  Modeling changes in eelgrass
populations.

Oyster disease studies: Supported by EPA/NEP, NOAA/NMFS, NH Fish and Game. 
Monitoring of the prevalence and intensity of MSX and Dermo infections in
indigenous oyster populations and their relation to temperature and salinity
regimes.

Microbial studies of estuarine Vibrio spp.:  Supported by NIH, Sea Grant.  The

regimes.

11. Missing Data
There is no turbidity data for either site for 1997 because we did not have
