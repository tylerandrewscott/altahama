2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6600 into the EcoWatch (version 
2.16) software, plotted, and initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing 
data. YSI raw data files are then downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) 
and imported into Microsoft Excel as a comma-space delimited file (.csv). These 
raw data files are then organized into standardized monthly data sets using the 
CDMO import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, 
import the raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters 
for depth readings if necessary, and save the monthly files as either a .csv or 
.xls file.  Once in monthly format, these files are then run through the 
cdmomac3.xls macros which identify outliers, insure correct number of data 
points for each Date/Hour count, and format the columns in the correct order and 
size. The monthly files are then carefully edited by staff for data anomalies 
which are identified in Section 11 (Data Anomalies) of this document. Any data 
that are deleted by staff are replaced with periods and identified in Section 
11. Monthly edited files are then FTP'd to CDMO in text format, along with an 
updated metadata form. Kim Miller is responsible for all the QA/QC process. 

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the 
Tates Hell Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage 
period and allowed increased runoff with a concommittant increase in pH which 
had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  Because of this 
some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was done. A 
large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant allowed them to begin 
restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning 
the dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay allows the Reserve to 
monitor changes in water quality during this restoration effort. Cat Point and 
Dry Bar stations collect water quality data associated with the health of 
oysters. These stations are located on two of the most productive oyster beds in 
the bay. They were chosen as sites so that the health of these economically 
important oyster bars could be monitored continuously. 

4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the 
NERRS national monitoring effort.  ANERR began monitoring three stations in the 
Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's. 
These stations continue to be monitored today using YSI 6600's and YSI 6600 EDS 
model sondes.  The East Bay station consists of two sites, including a sonde 
placed near the surface at this site and one located near the bottom sediment. 
Cat Point and Dry Bar are the other two stations located near two of the most 
productive oyster beds in Apalachicola Bay. Both Hydrolab and YSI dataloggers 
have been used at all stations interchangeably as required, however, only YSI 
6600 models were used to collect data in 2002. After 2001,  Hydrolabs were no 
longer used due to upgrades and two YSI 6000's were only used until February, 
when they were converted into 6600 EDS models. The Reserve used one more 
YSI 6000 until March 2002, and then it was no longer deployed due to 
communication problems. Prior to deployment, YSI 6600's (8) and YSI 6600 EDS's 
(2) are calibrated for conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, turbidity and pH 
following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual (with 
addendum 5/99). Lab grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) are initially 
used to calibrate the YSI's, which are then used to check working standards made 
up and used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab grade standards are also used 
periodically to check the accuracy of the working salinity standards.  The only 
variation from the manual is the use of two pH standards for two-point 
calibration of pH rather than three-point calibration.  The membranes for the 
dissolved oxygen probe are installed at least 12 hours prior to calibration.  
Depth is set to 0.0 meters in the lab. A turbidity probe was added to the YSI 
6000's in December 1996. Two turbidity probes are currently available for use 
with YSI sondes. The model 6026 turbidity probe has been offered by YSI since 
1995.  The Reserve began using the new turbidity probe (6136) in March 2002. 
These probes are calibrated using a lab grade, (Fisher Brand), 40 NTU standard 
and deionized water (0 NTU).  As of September 2002, 100 NTU (YSI Brand) was used 
for calibrations.  Following calibration, a guard is attached to the datalogger 
to protect the probes. A piece of plastic mesh is placed in the bottom of the 
guard and then attached to the outside of the guard to discourage any creatures 
from getting to the probes and to minimize fouling. The sondes are then 
programmed to begin recording data early in the morning prior to deployment. 
They are placed in a 5-gallon bucket with some water to sit overnight.  The D.O. 
probe is re-calibrated before deployment and the sonde is checked to insure that 
the instrument is working properly. 

In 2001, the task of wrapping the sonde in a wet, white towel during 
transportation for deployment and retrieval, became a part of the standardized 
procedure for YSI 6-series multi-parameter sondes. In 2002, this method still 
proves to be an effective method of transporting. During deployment and 
retrieval of the sondes, measurements of dissolved oxygen concentrations and 
percent saturation, as well as, salinity and temperature, are taken at the sites 
using a hand-held YSI meter. 

YSI 6600 and YSI 6600 EDS dataloggers are deployed on the same piling within a 
five inch diameter stainless-steel tube with a locking cap. In order to maintain 
constant depth, the dataloggers are clamped to a pvc pipe and lowered into the 
tube, relinquishing the need for diving.  Large holes were cut in the tube where 
the probes are located to insure adequate circulation.  Every two-three weeks 
the dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected.  Freshly 
calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data 
gaps in the 30 minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the 
northwestern part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located 
adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola 
Bay system, including 52 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both 
natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico. 

East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a causeway and is 
located to the north of the bay proper.  East Bay is 8.2 km long, has an average 
depth of approximately 1.0 m MHW, and an average width of 1.8 km. The tides in 
East Bay are mixed and range from 0.3 m to 1.0 m (average 0.5 m). The sampling 
site is located in the upper reaches of East Bay.  The piling location is 
latitude 29º 47.15' N and longitude 84º 52.52' W. At the sampling site, the 
depth is 2.2 m MHW and the width of the bay is 1 km.  The tides in the system 
are mixed, meaning the number of tides can range from one to five tides during a 
24 hour period and are not evenly distributed throughout the day.

At the East Bay bottom site the meter probes are 0.3 m above the bottom 
sediment. Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt and the long term average salinity is 
approximately 8 ppt.  At the East Bay surface site the meter probes are 1.7 m 
above the bottom sediment and salinity ranges from 0 ppt to 30 ppt with a long 
term average salinity of 6.3 ppt.  The freshwater input is very tanic and 
usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are not quantified due 
to the diverse sources of the runoff. The bottom habitat at this bay site is 
soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with no vegetation present. The dominant 
marsh vegetation near the sampling site is Juncus roemerianus and Cladium 
jamaicense.  The dominant upland vegetation is primarily pineland forests which 
includes slash pine, saw palmetto, and sand pine.  Upland land use near the 
sampling site includes conservation and silviculture uses with some single 
family residential in the lower East Bay area.  The sampling site is influenced 
by local runoff from Tates Hell Swamp, the East Bay marshes, and distributary 
flow, some of which comes from the Apalachicola River via the East River.  
Tates Hell Swamp was ditched, diked, and altered back in the late 1960's and 
early 1970's by timber companies.  These changes shortened the drainage period 
and allowed increased runoff with a concomitant decrease in pH and increase in 
color, which had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  
Restoration of Tates Hell Swamp began in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff. 

The Cat Point sampling site is located in St. George Sound, approximately 400 
meters east of the St. George Island Bridge. The piling location is latitude 29º 
42.12' N and longitude 84º 52.81' W.  The tides at Cat Point are mixed and range 
from 0.3m to 1.0m (average 0.5m). At the sampling site, the depth is 2 to 3 m 
MHW. (The sites was moved approximately 600 meters south in October 1997) and 
the width of the bay is 4 miles. At the Cat Point site the meter probes are 0.3 
meters above the bottom sediment. Salinity ranges from 0 to 32 ppt. Flows vary 
with local rainfall and are not quantified due to the diverse sources of the 
runoff. The bottom type is oyster bar with no vegetation present except algae 
growing on the oysters in the summer. The dominant upland vegetation nearby (2 
miles) is primarily pineland forests, which include slash pine, saw 
palmetto, and sand pine. Upland land use near the sampling site, includes, 
single family residential and commercial use in the Eastpoint area. The sampling 
site is influenced by local runoff from Tates Hell Swamp, flow from the 
Apalachicola River, and high salinity water that enters from East Pass at the 
end of St. George Island via tidal action. High salinity water comes mainly from 
the east, through East Pass at the end of St. George Island. 

The Dry Bar sampling site is located near St. Vincent Sound, in the western part 
of the Apalachicola Bay system, approximately one-half mile east of St. Vincent 
Island. The piling location is latitude 29º 40.48' N and longitude 85º 3.50' W. 
At the sampling site, the depth is 2 meters and the width of the bay is 7 miles. 
At the Dry Bar site the meter probes are located 0.3 meters above the bottom 
sediment. The tides are mixed and range from 0.3 to 1.0 meters. Salinity ranges 
from 0 to 34 ppt. The bottom type is oyster bar with no vegetation present, 
except algae that grows on the oysters during the summer months. The dominant 
upland vegetation includes, slash pine flatwoods with various combinations of 
gallberry, smooth cordgrass, fetterbush, cabbage palm, saw palmetto, magnolia, 
and grasses. Upland use near the sampling site includes state owned and 
managed Cape St. George Island and St. Vincent National Wildlife Refuge, as well 
as, single family residential and commercial use in the Apalachicola area. The 
sampling site is influenced from the flow of the Apalachicola River and high 
salinity water entering West Pass and Sikes Cut via tidal action. 

6. Data collection period:
The dataloggers were first deployed at the East Bay Surface site on April 17, 
1995.  East Bay bottom sampling began in January 1993.  Both have been 
continuously in service since then. Data from the two oyster bar stations, Cat 
Point and Dry Bar, has been collected since 1992, although this is the first 
year that the data from these stations will be submitted to the CDMO. During the 
year 2002, all deployments utilized YSI dataloggers. One YSI 6000-model sonde 
was used for two deployment periods early in the year. After February 2003, YSI 
6600 models and 6600 EDS models were used. Deployment dates and times for 2002

8. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been monitoring water quality at three stations in Apalachicola Bay 
since May of 1992, with the use of Hydrolab Datasondes and YSI 6-series model 
sondes. One of these stations was moved from the mid-bay area near the 
Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site in January of 1993.  The other 
two are located on two of the largest commercially important oyster bars in the 
bay.  These stations, like East Bay, are intended to be long-term. Other 
associated researchers and projects, which have, or continue to utilize this 
water quality data are:

12. Missing data:

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probe is deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.). To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.
