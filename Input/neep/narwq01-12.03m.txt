2.	Entry verification:
Data are downloaded from the YSI Model 6600 sondes to comma-delimited files 
(*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat) to a PC located at the reserve laboratory. 
Graphs are produced from the .dat files using the Eco-Watch application supplied 
by YSI and examined for obvious sensor failure, using the suggested data 
analysis protocol provided to the NERRS by YSI. A post-deployment check is run 
on the sondes to determine if there is significant sensor drift (>10%) due to 
biofouling. Fouling of sensors is detected by 1) visual inspection of the 
instrument, 2) post-deployment measurements taken using calibration standards, 
and 3) by comparing final measurements of a given deployment with initial 
measurements of the succeeding deployment.

Sea-truthing was conducted by measuring water quality with an additional 
datalogger taking real-time measurements at the time of deployment.  The data 
were recorded using a hand-held YSI 556-MPS datalogger. Values for temperature, 
salinity, DO mg/L, pH, and time were recorded real-time at 0.5 meter intervals 
between the surface and bottom at each deployment site.  Depth measurements were 
estimated using a weighted, nylon braid line marked at 0.5 meter intervals.  The 
preparation and post-deployment procedures for the data logger used in sea-
truthing follows the same general procedure as that for data loggers used in 
deployments, and is the responsibility of the reserve technicians.

The comma-delimited files are imported into Excel 2002 and a printed version is 
produced to aid in the QA/QC process. The file is processed using macros 
supplied by the CDMO which are designed to: 1) check data files for missing data 
points, 2) fill all cells that do not contain data with periods (.) (upon data 
review by the CDMO, periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and 
left blank); 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-approved formats for time, 
date and numeric variables; 4) find all data that are out of acceptable range 
for the sensors and write the anomalous data to an output file (*.dat); and 
5) save the files as Excel worksheets (*.xls).  The anomalous data are evaluated 
to determine whether to flag or delete the suspect data.  Data are flagged 
if the values are: 1) outside the range expected for the site (see Section 5, 
Site Location and Character), 2) outside the range of measurements and accuracy 
established for the sensors (Part II, Section 8: Variable Sequence, Range of Measurements, 
Units, Resolution, and Accuracy section), or 3) outside the range established 
for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen <4 mg/L).  Data are 
deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor malfunction, or 2) 
significant fouling of sensors by marine organisms. After appropriate 
corrections or deletions are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the files are 
exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt).  Robin Weber was responsible for these 
tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
YSI 6600 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve's (NERR) System Wide Water 
Quality Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to develop long-term data sets 
for representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality 
over time. Because Prudence Island is located in the geographic center of 
Narragansett Bay, it is an ideal location for monitoring the status and trends 
in water quality in the Bay over time. One NERR water quality monitoring station 
has been established at Potter's Cove, on the island's northeastern shore.  This 
area is impacted by boat traffic and storm runoff from mainland urban and 
residential areas. The second NERR water quality monitoring station, T-Wharf, is 
situated on the southeastern shore of the island, facing the open waters of 
Rhode Island Sound. It is approximately 6 miles south of the Potter's Cove site. 
Boat traffic is sparse at this site and storm runoff is less likely to have a 
significant impact on water quality. A third monitoring site was added in March 
2002.  This monitoring site is located in Nag Creek, a salt marsh tidal creek 
which flows into the West Passage of Narragansett Bay.  The addition of this 
site completes our representation of dominant habitat types occurring in 
Narragansett Bay (i.e. marsh, cove, and open water).  In July of 2002, the T-
Wharf monitoring station was replaced with two new monitoring sites located a 
short distance from the original T-Wharf location.  The new stations are 
situated on either side of a wharf support piling.  One datalogger records water 
quality near the surface while the second records water quality parameters 
approximately 0.5 meters off the bottom.  This allows for the identification of 
both the frequency and duration of any stratification which may occur in the 
open waters of Narragansett Bay.  The Narragansett Bay water quality monitoring 
program began in December 1995 at Potter's Cove, September 1996 at T-Wharf, and 
March 2002 at Nag Creek. (see Section 5, Site Location and Character section for 
description of sites).  YSI electronic data loggers were deployed to measure the 
water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth, and 
turbidity conditions at 30-minute intervals. With the exception of the T-Wharf 
Surface site, all dataloggers are deployed approximately 0.5 meters off the 
bottom.  

4.	Research Methods
One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in Narragansett 
Bay. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on 
the season, and measurements are taken every 30 minutes. The monitoring station 
at Potter's Cove was constructed in 1995, and it consists of a PVC pipe mounted 
vertically on a piling located approximately 6 feet west of a floating dock.  To 
facilitate water flow across the sensors, openings are cut into the PVC pipes.  
The pipes are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are less than 1 meter 
from the bottom.  In 1996, the T-Wharf station was put into service: the PVC 
pipe is mounted on a piling attached to a pier. The two replacement T-Wharf 
sites (surface and bottom) are also deployed in PVC pipes mounted to a piling.  
The datalogger at the T-Wharf surface station is maintained just below the 
surface by means of a buoy attached by rope to the adjacent wharf.  At this time 
a maintenance schedule was adopted whereby the pipes are cleaned monthly with a 
chimney brush during the summer to reduce the impact of biofouling on the data.  
The Nag Creek datalogger was originally deployed in a metal cage which was 
tethered to the bank.  A permanent deployment structure was installed 12/31/02 
and consists of a 4 by 4 pressure-treated post with a hinged 2 by 4 horizontal 
arm.  At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are retrieved and 
freshly cleaned and calibrated instruments are deployed. The retrieved data 
loggers are brought back to the laboratory, post deployment evaluations of the 
instrument are carried out, and the device is cleaned, calibrated, and 
serviced by methods outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual. After 
cleaning the data loggers, the pH, salinity, depth, and turbidity sensors are 
calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 and 10, salinity standard of 
30.36 ppt or specific conductivity standard of 50.00 mS/cm, depth in the air, 
and turbidity standards of 0 and 100 NTU, respectively.  The dissolved oxygen 
(DO) membrane is replaced and allowed to stretch for a minimum of 12 hours 
before the DO sensor is calibrated in water-saturated air. The sonde is 
programmed to begin taking measurements approximately 12 hours in advance of 
planned deployment, allowing the DO membrane to stabilize. The file is checked 
for DO sensor drift before the DO probe is calibrated. Calibration of the 
dissolved oxygen sensor is usually done within 2 hours of deployment.

Dissolved Oxygen Survey - Under the direction of Dr. Christopher Deacutis, with 
volunteers from the R.I. Dept. of Environmental Management, Roger Williams 
University, the University of Rhode Island, Brown University, the Environmental 
Protection Agency offices in Narragansett, RI and Lexington, MA, the 
Massachusetts Coastal Zoning Management Agency, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
the Narragansett Bay Commission, Save the Bay, Yellow Springs Instruments, and 
NBNERR staff. The goal of the survey is to take discrete samples within the 
water column (surface, bottom, and every 1.5 meters of depth) at more than 75 
stations in the Narragansett Bay. These surveys are performed overnight during 
neap tide. The project began in 1999, and takes place at least twice during the 
summer. The data will be used to map dissolved oxygen levels bay-wide and help 
to identify sites at risk for hypoxic and anoxic events. Inquiries should be 
directed to Dr. Deacutis at the RIDEM, Dept. of Water Resources, 235 Promenade 
St., Providence RI 02908, tel. (401) 222-4700 x7270.

January 1 - 31, Sampling period
PC
Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.  (Refer 
to notes in Section 14 regarding turbidity measurements).

Data for dissolved oxygen parameters were removed for the 1/08/03 deployment.  
The DO charge was out of range for the whole deployment which suggests probe 
failure.

Supersaturation measurements for dissolved oxygen (> 120%) were noted for the 
following dates and times:
1/27/2003	15:30:00-19:30:00, 20:30:00-23:00:00
1/28/2003	15:00:00, 17:00:00
1/31/2003	17:30:00-19:00:00, 20:00:00

Low salinity (< 25 ppt) occurred on the following dates and times:
Note: This dip in salinity corresponds to a period of high winds, no rain.  The 
data appear to be valid.
1/24/2003	9:00:00
1/24/2003	9:30:00
1/24/2003	10:00:00

A slight pH anomaly (not significant) occurred at the start of the 1/22/03 
deployment.  This anomaly is likely due to temperature shock.  

NC
Data are missing 1/8/03 from 10:30:00 to 13:00:00 during sonde changeover.  
Modifications to the deployment structure were being made at this time.

Data for all parameters were removed for the entire 1/8/03 deployment.  The 
sonde had become completely encased in ice and the data were considered invalid.  

Data are missing 1/29/02 at 13:00:00 through the end of the month.  No sonde was 
deployed at this time because of heavy ice in the tidal creek.

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.  (Refer 
to notes in Section 14 regarding turbidity measurements).

Supersaturation measurements for dissolved oxygen (> 120%) were noted for the 
following date and times:
1/05/2003	16:00:00-17:30:00

TS
Time stamp for the 12/31/02 and 1/28/03 deployments was off by 00:00:48, 
corrected to read on the hour and half hour.

Depth was recorded in feet for the 12/31/02 and 1/28/03 deployments, corrected 
to meters using a 3.2808 conversion factor.

Slight depth anomalies occur throughout the month.  Refer to notes (Section 14).

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.  (Refer 
to notes in Section 14 regarding turbidity measurements).

TB
Dissolved oxygen data for the 1/28/03 deployment were removed.  The DO charge 
was out of range for the entire deployment which suggests that the membrane was 
compromised.  

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.  (Refer 
to notes in Section 14 regarding turbidity measurements).

February 1 - 28, Sampling period 
PC
Data for dissolved oxygen parameters were removed for the 2/19/03 deployment.  
The DO charge was out of range for the whole deployment which suggests probe 
failure.  

Specific conductivity, salinity, and depth data for the 2/19/03 deployment were 
removed.  During the post deployment calibration check for this deployment the 
specific 
conductivity probe was reading 59.27 (in 50 mS/cm solution) and data values for 
this deployment were consistently high.  This would suggest that the specific 
conductivity sensor had not been properly calibrated. 

Supersaturation measurements for dissolved oxygen (> 120%) were noted for the 
following dates and times:
2/03/2003	12:30:00, 13:00:00, 14:00:00, 16:30:00, 19:00:00-23:30:00

NC
Data are missing from the start of the month through 2/5/03 at 15:30:00.  No 
sonde was deployed at this time due to heavy ice in the tidal creek.

Data are missing from 2/11/03 at 12:00:00 through the end of the month due to 
heavy ice in the tidal creek.

Remaining data for the month (approximately 6 days) may not be valid.  Greater 
turbidity values beginning 2/10/03 at 20:30:00 are a result of ice build-up and 
may 
indicate that all data were compromised at this time.

TS
Time stamp for the 2/25/03 deployment was off by 00:00:12, corrected to read on 
the hour and half hour.

TB
Dissolved oxygen data from the beginning of the month through 2/12/03 at 9:30:00 
were removed.  The DO charge was out of range for the entire deployment.

A single anomalous reading for pH occurred at the start of the 2/26/03 
deployment (at 9:30:00).  This is likely a result of temperature shock. 

There was a slight discontinuity in specific conductivity (and salinity) at the 
end of 1/28/03 deployment.  This discontinuity is most likely due to sensor 
drift and the data may require correction.

March 1 - 31, Sampling period
PC
Data for dissolved oxygen parameters were removed from the first of the month 
through 3/4/03 at 8:00:00 due to a probe failure.

Specific conductivity, salinity, and depth data were removed from the first of 
the month through 3/4/03 at 8:00:00 due to a calibration error.

Data are missing 5/8/03 11:30:00 through 12:30:00.  Although the sonde was 
deployed at this time, it was apparently caught up in the deployment pipe (based 
on depth values).  The data recorded at this time were not valid and were 
removed.

Time stamp for the 4/23/03 deployment was off by 00:01:00, adjusted to read on 
the hour and half hour.

Data for pH were removed from 5/1/03 at 4:00:00 through the end of the 
deployment (5/8/03 at 11:00:00).  An abrupt drop in pH occurred at this time and 
the data values did not recover.  This implies that the probe was not 
functioning properly, probably due to an obstruction on the pH probe.

There was some discontinuity between the 6/10/03 and 6/24/03 deployments for the 
dissolved oxygen parameters.  These data appear to be valid and the 
discontinuity is likely a result of the high level of variability in these 
parameters at this location.

The specific conductivity sensor was not functioning for the 6/10/03 deployment.  
All specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (mg/L), and depth data 
were removed from 6/10/03 at 9:00:00 through 6/24/03 at 9:00:00.

Time stamp for the 8/26/03 deployment was off by 00:00:13, corrected to read on 
the hour and half hour.

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.  (Refer 
to notes in Section 14 regarding turbidity measurements).

High turbidity values (> 250 NTU, </= 1000) occurred on the following date and 
time:
8/22/2003	1:30:00

There was a discontinuity in turbidity values at the start of the 8/26/03 
deployment.  This is likely a result of biofouling at the end of the 8/12/03 
deployment, data should be considered suspect.

Slight depth anomalies occur throughout the month.  Refer to notes (Section 14).

TB
Data are missing from the beginning of the month through 8/12/03 at 7:30:00.  
Water entered the battery chamber and the data were removed.

Data are missing from 8/26/03 at 8:30:00 to 9/10/03 at 8:00:00.  There was a 
communications error with the sonde.  The circuit board failed and required 
replacement.

Turbidity levels rise at the end of the 8/12/03 deployment.  The wiper on the 
probe was very dirty at sonde retrieval.  These data should be considered 
suspect due to biofouling.

Note:  The data suggest that these values are a result of biofouling and should 
be considered suspect.  Biofouling is also the likely cause of a similar rise in 
turbidity values at the end of the 8/20/03 deployment.  Although the turbidity 
values are not excessively high, these data may also be considered suspect.

There was a discontinuity in specific conductivity and salinity values at the 
start of the 12/9/03 deployment.  Variation throughout the month suggests that 
the data are 
valid.

Several salinity anomalies occur throughout the month (12/12/03, 12/15/03, 
12/18/03, and 12/27/03) and these correlate with slight anomalies in both pH and 
depth.  The mid-month anomalies correspond well with storm events (both low 
pressure and rainfall) and are considered to be valid.  The unexplained anomaly 
at the end of the month also appears to be valid.  It is considered likely that 
this may be a result of the sonde remaining in the lower saline surface layers 
during periods of low mixing.

Data are missing from the beginning of the month through 12/2/03 at 07:00:00.  A 
battery failure occurred at the end of the 11/18/03 deployment.

Time stamp for the 12/30/03 deployment was off by 00:01:00, corrected to read on 
the hour and half hour.

Discontinuity in depth occurs at the start of the 12/30/03 deployment.  Also, 
slight depth anomalies occur throughout the month.  Refer to notes (Section 14).

Turbidity reported several negative and/or zero values during the month.  (Refer 
to notes in Section 14 regarding turbidity measurements).

Low salinity (< 25 ppt) occurred on the following dates and times:
12/20/2003	6:00:00-7:00:00, 8:30:00, 11:00:00-15:00:00, 17:30:00, 20:00:00-

 There is some discontinuity in pH at the start and end of the 12/16/03 
deployment.  Data for the entire deployment appear to be reading slightly high 
for pH and should be corrected.

12. Missing data:
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks/Notes
a) Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero and/or negative value 
in the edited data file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited 
none of these data points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them. 

b.) Slight depth anomalies frequently occur at the Nag Creek deployment 
location.  A new deployment structure was installed at this location on 
12/31/02. The structure consists of a post with stabilizers embedded in the 
creek substrate with a horizontal hinged arm to which the sonde is attached by 
cable ties.  Some modifications were made to this structure throughout the next 
few months, resulting in slight depth anomalies. Depth at this site was also 
influenced to some extent by changes in atmospheric pressure because the sonde 
was situated in very shallow waters.  On occasion, the combination of low 
atmospheric pressure and shallow water resulted in negative depth values.  
Weather station data appear to support this theory.

c.) There were a greater number of discontinuities in DO at all sites during the 
summer months and throughout the year at Nag Creek.  Discontinuities are implied 
by a > 10 % change in recorded data values between the last sample of a 
deployment and the first sample of the subsequent deployment.  Due to a greater 
natural variation in DO levels during the summer, a > 10 % change is more likely 
to occur.  Discontinuities were not noted in instances when these appeared to be 
a result of variation in DO levels, following the same general pattern over 
time, rather than due to possible drift.  

d.) On some occasions, dissolved oxygen is recorded as negative values at the 
Nag Creek deployment location.  DO frequently ranges between supersaturation and 
complete anoxic conditions (DO = 0 % saturation) at this site during the summer 
months.  The negative values are considered to occur as a result of calibration 
error and should be corrected to zero. 

e.) Slight depth anomalies occurred at the T-Wharf surface monitoring station.  
The datalogger at this station was suspended from the bottom of a buoy attached 
by rope to the adjacent wharf.  On occasion it became apparent that the sonde 
and/or buoy had become caught up in the rope, but never to such an extent that 
the sonde came out of the water.  Wave action during periods of high winds may 
be responsible for some of the depth variation.  The sonde is attached to a 
float and is readily impacted.  Deployment near the surface also allows for 
depth measurements to be altered by changes in atmospheric pressure.  At no time 
were the variations in depth considered sufficient to alter the validity of the 
data.

f.) Throughout the year, and at different monitoring stations, entire 
deployments measured pH levels which were consistently higher and/or lower than 
adjacent deployments. Although not discontinuities per se because the 
differences are not significant, they become obvious when the data set is viewed 
over a long time period.  It should be noted that the pH probes responsible all 
calibrated properly and checked out well at post deployment.  It may be 
necessary to make corrections to the data to reflect more credible pH levels.
