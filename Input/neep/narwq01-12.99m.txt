2.  Entry verification.

Other water quality measurements are made by standard field methods at the time 
of datalogger deployment and weekly thereafter.  Results are compared with YSI 
6000 data records.  Data may be corrected based on the comparative analyses and 
is then so noted in the data anomaly section of the metadata form. 

Temperature is measured by mercury thermometer calibrated with a NBS certified 
thermometer.  Dissolved oxygen is determined by a modified Winkler titration.  
Salinity is measured with a Hydrolab Surveyor 3 equipped with a salinity/ 
conductivity sensor.  A Corning benchtop pH meter determines the pH.  Turbidity 
is presently measured with a Secchi disk.  (This method does not provide data 
that is comparable to the YSI data.  An appropriate method recommended by the 
manufacturer and accepted by the scientific community will be used in the 
future.)  Allan Beck is responsible for these water quality measurements.

Data is uploaded to a PC from the YSI datalogger using the PC6000 software in 
both the PC6000 format and in comma-delimited format.  The comma-delimited data 
is opened in Excel 5.0 and edited to remove headers and extra spaces.  Each file 
contains a month's data and missing days are denoted by periods.  Quality 
control of the database was accomplished using CDMO macros and by always 
graphing out data, looking for outliers, missing data, and other anomalies.  
Susan C. Adamowicz performed all quality control on the data.

3.  Research objectives.

YSI6000 dataloggers are being deployed off Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay 
as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve's (NERR) Water Quality 
Monitoring Program. The goal is to develop long-term data sets for 
representative estuarine systems in order to track changes in water quality over 
time. The instruments are deployed for two to four weeks at a time, depending on 
season, and measurements are taken every 30 minutes.  Currently two stations on 
Prudence Island, Potters Cove in the north and the T-Wharf on the southern tip 
of the island have been established.   The Potters Cove site, which was 
established in December 1995 receives waste from boaters and is considered an 
impacted site.  All Rhode Island State waters, however, were declared a federal 
no-discharge zone (for marine sewage) in late spring 1998.  It is now illegal 
for boaters to discharge treated or untreated sewage into waters of the state, 
including Potters Cove.  The T-Wharf site is in open water on Narragansett Bay.

4.  Research Methods.

Before each deployment, routine maintenance and calibration of the YSI 
instrument are carried out.  The instrument is cleaned to remove any fouling and 
the probes are checked for cracks or other visible signs of damage.  O-rings are 
cleaned and greased, and batteries installed.  Calibrations are performed for 
salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, depth, and turbidity.  For the salinity 
calibration, filtered seawater from Narragansett Bay is collected and its 
salinity determined using an autosal.  This seawater is then used as a salinity 
standard. A two-point pH calibration is performed using pre-made buffer 
solutions of pH 7 and 10 obtained from Fisher Scientific. Old pH solutions are 
used for rinsing the probes.  The dissolved oxygen membrane is replaced 24 hours 
prior to calibration.  The DO probe is calibrated by placing a wet sponge in the 
calibration cup and allowing the instrument to equilibrate, as per the 
manufacturer's instructions, for a 100% air saturation calibration.  The depth 
sensor is calibrated to sea level with the sonde lying horizontal on a 
countertop, calibration cup and nearby objects removed.  As of December 28, 
1998, a three-point (0, 10, 100 NTU) turbidity calibration was instituted using 
distilled, deionized water, a diluted turbidity standard solution, and a full-
strength standard (standard obtained from YSI Inc.)

The sondes are deployed in PVC tubes with sections cut out to allow water flow.  
The PVC tube is attached to a dock.   The sondes are programmed to collect data 
every 30 minutes during deployment.  Deployments generally last two weeks to 
four weeks, data collection is continuous unless some mishap occurs.  At the end 
of each deployment, the data is uploaded, put in Excel format, and QA/QC'd using 
the Excel Macros provided by the CDMO.  

5. Site Location and Character.

The NARNERR consists of 2200 acres of diverse estuarine and terrestrial habitats 
ranging from deep water to salt marshes to forested uplands.  The land holdings 
include 60% of Prudence Island, most of nearby Patience Island and all of Hope 
Island off the west shore of Prudence.  The Reserve is located close to the 
geographical center of Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island.

10.  Anomalous Data
GENERAL NOTES:  Data files & deployment times are given above since it was noted 
that occasionally there are abrupt shifts in some variables at time of 
changeover.  Individual instances of negative turbidity are not noted.  They 
should be interpreted as zero values except where noted.  

January, 1999:
	PC: DO spike at changeover 1/13 @ 9:00:00 hr.  For the month of January, 
there were 249 negative turbidity values throughout the month due calibration 
errors.

	TW:  Sonde not deployed until March 1999.

February, 1999: 
	PC:  DO values on 2/3 9:00:00 hr show anomalous readings; DO settled down 
within 48 hours.  Not sure what accounted for these results, may have been 
associated with increased temperatures?  Data left in to display trends.  DO 
spike at changeover 2/3 @ 9:00:00 hr.  For the month of February, there were 118 
negative turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	TW:  Sonde not deployed until March 1999.
	 
March, 1999:
	PC: DO spike at changeover 3/10 9:00:00 hr.  Changed turbidity reading on 
3/31 9:00:00 hr from 104.8 to "." due to reading occurring almost immediately at 
changeover.  For the month of March, there were 70 negative turbidity values 
throughout the month due calibration errors.

	TW:  DO deleted from 3/24 0:30:00 hr --> 3/31 5:30:00 hr due to membrane 
puncture.  Turbidity high on 3/22 0:30:00 hr (521.7 ntu).

April, 1999:
	PC: Salinity of 29.26 on 4/11 at 18:30:00 hr looks like spike on graph, 
but is a real reading.  For the month of April, there were 647 negative 
turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	TW: Missing data:  DO  4/28 20:30:00 hr --> end of month due to membrane 
puncture.  Anomalous data:  Turbidity 4/1 18:30:00 hr (-620.2 ntu); 22:30:00 hr 
(565.4 ntu); 23:30:00 hr (466.9 ntu); 4/22 22:00:00 hr (1501.5 ntu).  Sonde 
deployed on 4/21 broke off from tether and fell to bottom sediments at an 
unknown date and time, though suspect possibly on 5/11/99 due to increased 
turbidity readings.  For the month of April, there were 108 additional negative 
turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.

	 
May, 1999:
	PC:  Data deleted on 5/19 at 8:00:00 --> 8:30:00 hr due to change-over/ 
time set on ABPC05 possibly off by 1 hr.	Negative turbidity value on 5/1 
10:30:00 (-0.1 ntu).
TW:  Sonde deployed on 4/21 was lost from tether and fell to bottom sediments at 
an unknown data and time, though suspect possibly on 5/11/99 due to increased 
turbidity readings.  Deleted DO data from 5/1 --> end of month due to membrane 
puncture. 

June, 1999:
	PC:	DO problematic 6/28 @ 9:00:00 --> end of month.  Missing data:  6/16 
9:00:00 hr --> 6/28 8:30:00 hr.  Sonde AAPC0699 was deployed, but no data were 
captured.  Not sure why unit failed - it had calibrated correctly prior to 
deployment.  Turbidity of 397.3 ntu on 6/1 @ 0:00:00 hr appears anomalous but 
left in data set.  For the month of June, there were 60 negative turbidity 
values throughout the month due calibration errors.
TW:  This unit was "lost at sea" but was located near station, on bay bottom on 
6/17.  Deployments on 6/18 and 6/28 both resulted in "jumps" in data values.   
Anomalous turbidity values from 6/1 --> 6/17 possibly due to position on bay 
bottom.

July, 1999
	PC: Salinity of 25.18 on 7/2 @ 7:00:00 is low, but seems correct.  
Turbidity from 7/15 8:00:00 hr --> 7/28 6:30:00 not recorded, probe was broken 
so not deployed.  For the month of July, there were 229 negative turbidity 
values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	TW:  Missing turbidity data on 7/28 9:00:00 hr --> end of month due to 
broken probe.  Anomalous turbidity data on 7/15 20:00:00 hr (1220.5 ntu).  
Anomalous salinity on following dates and times:  7/7 10:00:00 hr (20.1); 7/8 
2:00:00 hr (23.7) 7/27 5:00:00 hr (28.4)--> 14:00:00 hr.  These salinity values 
are relatively low, may be a patch of water intruding into the area?  
Redeployment on 7/28 also resulted in "jump" in data values.

August, 1999:
	PC:  DO data removed from 8/22 17:30:00 --> 8/25 9:30:00 hr due to 
membrane puncture.  Turbidity on 8/13 at 1:30:00 and 2:00:00 hr anomalous (1318, 
503.6 ntu, respectively).  For the month of August, there were 43 negative 
turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	TW:  DO data from 8/8 1:00:00 --> 8/13 8:00:00 hr deleted due to membrane 
puncture.  Missing turbidity data from 8/1 0:00:00 hr --> 8/13 8:00:00 hr and 
8/25 7:30:00 hr --> to end of month due to broken probe.  Anomalous DO data on 
8/20 1:00:00 hr, 1:30:00 hr (2.8 and 0.2 mg/l; -38.7 and -2.9%, respectively).  
These DO data deleted, replaced with "."  Redeployment on 8/13 also resulted in 
"jump" in data values.  For the month of August, there were 357 negative 
turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	
September, 1999:
	PC: DO from 9/5 6:30:00 hr --> 9/13 8:00:00 hr looks like small puncture 
or other problem.  However data left in record for what it's worth.  Turbidity 
readings anomalous on following dates/times:  9/2 11:30:00, 15:30:00, 19:00:00 
hr (1363.4, 1363.9, 1365 ntu, respectively); 9/13 12:00:00 hr (-1077 ntu); 9/19 
13:30:00 hr (-397 ntu).  For the month of September, there were 403 additional 
negative turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	TW:  Missing turbidity data 9/1 0:00:00 hr --> 9/13 8:30:00 hr due to 
broken probe.  No data collected 9/13 9:00:00 hr; 9/29 9:00:00 --> end of month 
due to malfunction/batteries (?).  High, anomalous turbidity data on 9/24 --> 
end of the month.  Salinity drop on 9/9 --> 9/13; not sure of cause, possibly 
related to hurricane.  For the month of September, there were 596 negative 
turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.

October, 1999:
	PC:  Missing data:  10/26 8:00:00 hr --> 10/27 7:30:00 hr due to gap in 
deployment.  Anomalous turbidity readings 10/2 17:00:00 hr (661.9 ntu), 10/13 
18:00:00 hr (837.5 ntu); 10/14 6:00:00 hr (260.9 ntu).  For the month of 
October, there were 118 negative turbidity values throughout the month due 
calibration errors.

	TW:  Missing data on 10/1 00:00:00 hr --> 10/27 8:00:00 hr due to sonde 
malfunction/sonde batteries?  Anomalous turbidity data on 10/30 1:30:00 hr 
(1296.6 ntu).  



November, 1999
	PC: DO data are probably not reliable from 11/1 --> 11/10 9:00:00 hr, but 
was left in record. Anomalous turbidity readings on 11/11 3:00:00 hr, 5:00:00 hr 
(285.1 and 1465.6 ntu, respectively).  High turbidity reading also on 11/13 
00:00:00 hr (423.6 ntu).  For the month of November, there were 213 negative 
turbidity values throughout the month due calibration errors.
	TW:  DO data deleted 11/2 6:30:00 hr --> 11/10 8:30:00 hr due to punctured 
membrane.  Anomalous turbidity spikes on 11/3 0:30:00 (1225.2); 11/11 4:00:00 
and 4:30:00 hr (1155.4 ntu); 11/14 19:00:00 hr (739.5 ntu); 11/24 0:00:00 hr 
(819.6 ntu); 11/25 22:00:00 , 23:30:00 hr ( 646.1 and 1001.2 ntu, respectively); 
11/30 14:30:00 hr (1059 ntu).  Negative turbidity reading on 11/19 10:00:00 (-
0.1 ntu).  DO also anomalous 11/23 19:30:00 and 20:00:00 hr (6.06 and 5.76 mg/l, 
respectively).  Low DO may be water cell passing or animal in sonde cap.  

December, 1999
	PC: DO membrane fouled (?) from 12/2 13:30 hr --> 12/22 9:00:00 hr.  Sonde 
had been outside (but with protector cap on and moist sponge inside) for several 
hours before put in water and then deployed on 12/2.  See *.CSV file for 
details.  Spike in DO at change-over on 12/22 9:00:00 - 9:30:00 hr.  For the 
month of December, there were 176 negative turbidity values throughout the month 
due calibration errors.
	TW:  No data collected 12/30 20:00:00 hr --> 21:00:00 hr possibly due to 
low batteries.  Anomalous turbidity readings on the following dates and times:  
12/1 3:30:00 (1148.6 ntu); 12/3 3:30:00, 5:00:00, 6:00:00 (1272.4, 1369.2, 642.4 
ntu, respectively); 12/4 5:30:00 hr (489.9 ntu); 12/11 17:00:00 hr (493.2 ntu); 
12/22 3:00:00, 4:30:00, 5:30:00 hr (1185.7, 1365.1, 572.9 ntu, respectively).

	PC: Changed turbidity reading on 3/31 9:00:00 hr from 104.8 to "." due to 
reading occurring almost immediately at changeover.
	TW:  Sonde not deployed until 3/19 10:00:00 hr.  DO deleted from 3/24 
0:30:00 hr --> 3/31 5:30:00 hr due to membrane puncture.  Sonde not deployed, 
data missing 3/31 6:00:00 --> 9:00:00 hr.	 

April, 1999:

	TW: Missing DO data on 4/28 20:30:00 hr --> end of month due to membrane 
puncture.  No data collected from 4/2 0:30:00 hr --> 4/21 8:30:00 hr at 
changeover.  Not sure why sonde ceased data collection.  	 

May, 1999:
	PC:  Data deleted on 5/19 at 8:00:00 --> 8:30:00 hr due to change-over/ 
time set on ABPC05 possibly off by 1 hr.	
TW: Deleted DO data from 5/1 --> end of month due to membrane puncture. 

June, 1999:
	PC:	Missing data: 6/16 9:00:00 hr --> 6/28 8:30:00 hr.  Sonde AAPC0699 
was deployed, but no data were captured.  Not sure why unit failed - it had 
calibrated correctly prior to deployment.  
TW: No data collected between deployments on 6/17 8:30:00 --> 6/18 8:00:00; 6/28 
13:30:00.  No data collected between 6/1 0:00:00 --> 6/17 8:00:00.

July, 1999:
	PC: Missing data from 7/28 7:00:00 - 7:30:00 hr due to changeover.  
Turbidity from 7/15 8:00:00 hr --> 7/28 6:30:00 not recorded, probe was broken 
so not deployed.  
	TW:  Missing turbidity data on 7/28 9:00:00 hr --> end of month due to 
broken probe.  No data collected between deployments on 7/28 8:30:00 hr.

August, 1999:
	PC: Data missing 8/25 10:00:00 --> 10:30:00 hr due to changeover.  DO data 
removed from 8/22 17:30:00 --> 8/25 9:30:00 hr due to membrane puncture.  
	TW:  DO data from 8/8 1:00:00 hr --> 8/13 8:00:00 hr deleted due to 
membrane puncture.  Missing turbidity data from 8/1 0:00:00 hr --> 8/13 8:00:00 
hr and 8/25 7:30:00 hr --> to end of month due to broken probe.  Anomalous DO 
data on 8/20 1:00:00 hr, 1:30:00 hr (2.8 and 0.2 mg/l; -38.7 and -2.9%, 
respectively).  These DO data deleted, replaced with "."
	
September, 1999:
	PC: No missing data.
	TW:  Missing turbidity data 9/1 0:00:00 hr --> 9/13 8:30:00 hr due to 
broken probe.  No data collected 9/13 9:00:00 hr; 9/29 9:00:00 --> end of month 
due to malfunction/batteries (?).

October, 1999:
	PC:  Missing data: 10/26 8:00:00 hr --> 10/27 7:30:00 hr due to gap in

	TW:  Missing data on 10/1 00:00:00 hr --> 10/27 8:00:00 hr due to sonde 
malfunction/sonde batteries.

November, 1998
	PC: No missing data.
	TW:  DO data deleted 11/2 6:30:00 hr --> 11/10 8:30:00 hr due to punctured 
membrane.  

December, 1998
	PC: No missing data.
	TW:  No data collected 12/30 20:00:00 hr --> 21:00:00 hr possibly due to
