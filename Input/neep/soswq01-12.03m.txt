2)	Entry verification

The .dat data files are uploaded to a PC from YSI-6600 datasondes using the 
EcoWatch software.  Graphs are produced and printed for an initial visual QA/QC 
check of the data.  Notes are made of any suspect data that may result from 
probe failures and sensors are reconditioned as necessary.  Files are exported 
as .csv files using EcoWatch software.  The comma-delimited files are then 
imported into an Excel spreadsheet using the Import macro designed by CDMO.  
Data files are revised using cdmomac3.xls macros that: 1) check data files for 
missing data points; 2) add periods to cells with no data points, which were 
later removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank; 3) check for 
outliers by flagging all data that are outside the acceptable range for the 
sensors; 4) check for correct date and time intervals; 5) format the data 
columns to the CDMO standards for time, date, and numeric variables; 6) save the 
files as Excel worksheets; and 7) generate single parameter monthly graphs.  The 
file is then printed, and the data reviewed.  Data at the beginning and end of 
each data record between retrieval and re-deployment are deleted.  These data 
are identified by field notes that document the times of deployment and 
retrieval and by the sudden change in Specific Conductivity and Depth records.  
Data in the remainder of the record are not deleted unless supporting reasons 
can be documented.

The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete the 
suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range expected 
for the site (see Site Location and Character, Section 5), 2) outside the range 
of measurements and accuracy established for the sensors (see Section 9), or 3) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions at the 
particular site (i.e., Turbidity >150 NTU, negative Turbidity, variable DO, or 
sudden data spikes).  Data outside the acceptable range of water quality for a 
monitoring site are investigated for validity based on weather data, field 
observations, QC checks, data printouts, and instrument diagnostics.  Data are 
deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) sensor malfunction — if the 
voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the sensor or 
if the sensor will not calibrate, 2) exposure of sensors during low tide if it 
can be determined that freshwater inflow was not responsible — identified by 
unusual Depth, Temperature, and Specific Conductivity data, or 3) severe fouling 
of sensors by aquatic organisms, debris or sediment — detected by comparing in 
situ sensor with measurements (see Section 4).  Because the Depth sensor is non-
vented, negative values were not rejected unless they corresponded to Specific 
Conductivity or other data indicating that the sonde was out of the water.  
Large positive Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU) were reported in the anomalous 
data section, but those larger than 1000 NTU were deleted.  In addition, sensor 
readings that differ significantly (>10%) from standard solutions (e.g., 
Conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during deployment.  If it is 
possible to determine the reason for the difference, the data are deleted.  
Otherwise they are flagged in the metadata.  After corrections are made to the 
Excel worksheet, the edited files are exported as tab-delimited files and sent 
to the CDMO.  All .csv files are also sent to the CDMO via FTP for archival.  
Sue Powell has been responsible for data management since 9/1999. 

3)	Research objectives

Four long-term monitoring stations have been established along the estuarine 
gradient of the South Slough in order to collect essential baseline information 
and improve our understanding of tidal dynamics and watershed inputs.  In 
particular, the South Slough NERR/SWMP monitoring stations collect continuous 
information to address three primary topics:  1) short-term variability and 
long-term changes in estuarine water parameters within different regions of the 
estuary (i.e., localized impacts of seasonal storm events, variability in water 
quality parameters in association with re-establishment of tidal circulation, 
interannual differences in rainfall, magnitude and influence of El Niño – La 
Niña events, spatial extent of oceanic and tidal forcing, and long-term changes 
associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation); 2) verification, calibration, 
and future refinement of an existing two-dimensional water quality model (CE-
QUAL-W2) developed to predict levels of coliform bacteria and dispersion of 
environmental toxins; and 3) collection of fundamental baseline data for future 
development of a three-dimensional tidal hydrodynamic model for the greater 
South Slough/Coos Bay estuaries.

The South Slough estuary contains three primary sub-systems that provide much of 
the freshwater input to the area.  Only two sub-systems, the Sengstacken and 
Winchester arms, are within Reserve boundaries.  One long-term monitoring 
station was sited in the riverine portion of each arm in 1995.  The Sengstacken 
station is located in a semi-pristine area with no development and serves as a 
reference site for the riverine portion of the estuary.  The Winchester station 
is similarly located in an area with development limited to one farm (<15 
cattle) high in the watershed.  This station functions as a management-treatment 
site for saltmarsh restoration activities in the Winchester Tidelands 
Restoration Project.  The Valino station was established in June 1999 in the 
southern end of the marine-dominated region of the South Slough estuary, 
downstream from the two riverine stations.  Charleston, the fourth monitoring 
station, was installed in April 2002 close to the marine/estuarine interface.  
Both the Valino and Charleston stations are outside the South Slough NERR 
boundaries.

YSI data loggers are deployed at each site so that the sensor arrays are held 15 
cm (Sengstacken) to 50 cm (Winchester, Valino and Charleston) off the bottom of 
the tidal channels that are approximately 3 meters deep.  The loggers are 
programmed to record water quality parameter measurements every 30 minutes over 
22-30 day periods.  Parameters measured include Depth, Temperature, Salinity, 
Specific Conductivity, pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Turbidity, and Chlorophyll 
(data are not reported to CDMO).

4)	Research methods

One data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station in the South 
Slough estuary.  All data are recorded in Pacific Standard Time.  Sites are 
accessed at high tide, preferably above 7.0', in a small skiff equipped with an 
outboard motor.  Because of concerns about variability between different data 
loggers, they are not interchanged among sites, but are returned to the same 
site approximately 24 hours later.  During transport, each sonde is wrapped in a 
tap water-soaked white towel and placed horizontally in a vented cooler for 
insulation against jarring.  To deploy, the data loggers are lowered by chain 
into protective cases (constructed from 4"-diameter ABS plumbing pipe).  The ABS 
cases are drilled out to ensure adequate tidal flushing and exposure of the 
probes to ambient water conditions.  The cases are affixed vertically to 
existing log pilings driven into the mud.  A bolt prevents the data logger from 
descending beyond the ABS pipe and ensures that the logger monitors at the same 
depth on every deployment.  On April 14, 2003, the Valino ABS pipe was 
inspected for marine growth and obstruction of water flow.  On-site, the bottom 
1-meter of pipe was replaced and attached to the existing pipe via a threaded 
sleeve.  Anti-fouling paint was applied to as much of the pipe length as 
possible.  The sonde was returned to within 1 mm of the original depth.  It was 
noted that all sonde sensors were immersed during a -1.2' low tide series. 

During retrieval, the data loggers are again wrapped in a saturated white towel 
and placed in a cooler for transport to the lab.  To record post-deployment 
dissolved oxygen in 100% water-saturated air, at least two data points are 
recorded after the sonde reaches room temperature and while it is wrapped in the 
towel.  The other post-deployment calibrations are performed in the lab 
prior to cleaning to determine if instrument drift has occurred and to evaluate 
the validity of the data.  Sonde cleaning and calibration of the DO, 
Conductivity, Depth, pH, Turbidity, and Chlorophyll probes are performed as 
outlined in the YSI manual.  For Conductivity and Salinity, YSI calibrator 
solution 3168 (10,000 µS/cm) is used without dilution.  For pH calibrations, 
Corning pH 7 and 10 solutions are used.  A two-point calibration is used for 
Turbidity using 0 NTU (distilled water) and 123 NTU (YSI 6073G).  The 
Chlorophyll probe is calibrated with distilled water, and Depth is calibrated in 
air.  The DO membrane is replaced every time and calibrated, allowed to stretch 
for 16-24 hours, and re-calibrated before deployment, if necessary.  The sondes 
are redeployed 24 hours after retrieval unless safety issues arise during poor 
weather.  

As a quality assurance check, field calibrations are recorded during sonde 
deployment and retrieval.  As close to the 30-minute sonde recording time as 
possible, a hand-held YSI 600QS records DO, Salinity, Specific Conductivity, and 
Temperature both at the surface and at the level of the sonde array.

5)	Site location and character

South Slough is characterized as a drowned river-mouth estuary in the Lower 
Columbia Biogeographic Region.  South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve 
is representative of the mid-Pacific portion of the Columbian Bioregion, 
extending from Cape Mendocino, CA north to the Columbia River, OR.  The South 
Slough, located five miles southwest of the city of Coos Bay, is one of seven 
tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos estuary.  The four sites within the 
South Slough that are being monitored with YSI data loggers are:

1)  Sengstacken Arm (SE) (Talbot Creek):  [43º 17.374' N, 124º 18.156' W]
This station serves as a reference site and is located within the riverine 
(southern) region of the Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek) immediately adjacent to 
4.3 ha of natural salt marsh.  The site is approximately 6.6 km from the mouth 
of the South Slough estuary.  Tidal range is 2.1 meters, and monthly mean 
Salinity ranges between 3-28 psu.  Mean Temperatures range from 7-18 oC.  
Freshwater inputs have not been quantified.  Tidal waters in the riverine 
channels are typically well mixed in summer when the Salinity ranges from 5-30 
psu, and they are well flushed and partially stratified during the rainy season 
when the Salinities fluctuate from 0-21 psu.  The YSI is deployed in a tidal 
channel approximately 3 m deep and the sensor arrays are 15 cm off the bottom.  

2) 	Winchester Arm (WI) (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project site): [43º 
16.945' N, 124º 19.216' W]This station serves as a management-treatment site and 
is located within the riverine (southern) portion of the Winchester Arm (Kunz 
Marsh) and is approximately 7.1 km from the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  
The site is adjacent to an experimental marsh restoration area, where dikes 
were removed from a 5.1 ha area in 1996 and 1998.  About 4.2 hectares of natural 
marsh surround the project site.  Tidal amplitude is 2.0 meters, monthly mean 
Salinities are between 4-20 psu, and mean Temperatures range from 8-18 oC.  
Freshwater inputs are between 1-23 cfs, depending on precipitation events.  
Similar to the Sengstacken site, the YSI is deployed in a 3 m deep tidal 
channel with the sensor arrays 50 cm above the bottom. 

Both sites 1 and 2 are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to 
intertidal marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera 
marina).  The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in 
channel width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel with regard 
to the predominant north-south winds.  Above both sites is primarily second-
growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial sites in the watershed.  
One residential site that is outside the South Slough Reserve's boundary is 
located in the Upper Winchester watershed.

3) 	Valino Island (VA):  [43º 19.034' N, 124º 19.298' W]
This station serves as a secondary reference area and is located immediately 
north of Valino Island, in the southern portion of the marine-dominated region 
of the estuary.  Freshwater input is mainly from rainfall and via three primary 
creeks that drain adjacent watershed sub-basins.  Additional freshwater enters 
this region indirectly during ebb tides from the Winchester and Sengstacken arms 
of the estuary.  The Valino site is approximately 3.6 km from the mouth of South 
Slough estuary.  Situated in the primary tidal channel, the station is adjacent 
to productive eelgrass beds, tidal mudflats, sandflats, and commercial oyster 
cultivation areas.  The tidal range is about 2.7 meters and monthly mean 
Salinities fluctuate seasonally from 5-31 psu.  The tidal channel is about 4 m 
deep and the YSI sensors are 50 cm off the bottom.  There are no known point 
source pollutants although high bacterial levels from unknown sources cause 
frequent regulatory problems for commercial oyster growers. 

4) 	Charleston Bridge (CH):  [43º 20.262' N, 124º 19.232' W] 
This station serves as another reference area and is located immediately south 
of the Charleston Bridge in the northern end of the marine-dominated portion of 
the estuary.  The site is approximately 1.2 km from the mouth of South Slough 
estuary and 2.4 km north of the Valino site.  The YSI station is affixed to a 
log dock with controlled access by land for security purposes.  Situated in the 
primary tidal channel, the station is adjacent to extensive eelgrass beds, tidal 
mudflats, sandflats, and commercial oyster cultivation areas.  The tidal 
amplitude is 2.7 meters, monthly mean Temperatures range from 8-15 oC, and the 
monthly mean Salinities fluctuate seasonally from 20-33 psu. The tidal channel 
is about 4.5 meters deep. The adjacent Joe Ney Slough has a decade-long history 
of tributyltin pollution.  The area was voluntarily cleaned up in the mid-1990s 
and passed DEQ site review.  In addition, occasional high bacterial levels are 
noted.  Freshwater input is limited to seasonal rainwater and a small transient 
salinity/density signal from Joe Ney Slough. 

6)	Data collection period

The data loggers were first deployed at the Winchester site on April 04, 1995 
and at the Sengstacken site on April 19, 1995.  The Valino data logger was 
deployed on June 03, 1999.  The new Charleston Bridge site was constructed and 
the data logger deployed on April 19, 2002.  All monitoring is long term with an 
average data collection period of 27 days.  In 2002, the collection dates and 
times were:

8)	Associated researchers and projects

The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State 
of Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the 
Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development and the Oregon Department 
of Environmental Quality in July 1995.

Several researchers are currently using water quality data recorded at the YSI 
stations.  
Michele Koehler, Restoration Monitoring Coordinator at SSNERR used the 2002-03 
SWMP data to profile habitat for salmonids and other estuarine fish species.  

Jessica Miller, a Ph.D. candidate from the University of Oregon Institute of 
Marine Biology (OIMB), is investigating the role of estuaries in the patterns of 
transport, delivery, and habitat use in coastal fishes.  The SWMP water quality 
data are essential for time series analyses of larval and juvenile fish use of 
Coos Bay and South Slough.  A NERR Graduate Research Fellowship supports 
her work.  

Mike Berger, a Ph.D. candidate at OIMB, is studying recruitment dynamics of 
Balanomorph barnacles along an estuarine gradient.  In addition to study sites 
at the CH and WI monitoring stations, he equipped a third study site (Sloughside 
Pilings) with a YSI 6000 datalogger for short-term water quality data 
collection.  A NERR Graduate Research Fellowship currently supports his 
work.  

Catherine DeRivera of the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center is using 
SWMP datasets to supplement her study of larval deposition in estuaries along 
the West Coast.  

In addition, we are currently investigating the possibility of working with 
PISCO:  Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans.  They study 
the nearshore ecosystems of the West Coast, and correlating trends with data 
from the estuary would enhance both of our projects.

Dissolved Oxygen qualifier:  The reliability of the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) data 
after 96 hours post-deployment for non-EDS (Extended Deployment System) 
datasondes may be problematic due to fouling which forms on the DO probe 
membrane during some deployments (Wenner et al., 2001). Many Reserves have 
upgraded to the YSI 6600 EDS data sondes, which increases DO accuracy and 
longevity by reducing the environmental effects of fouling.  The user is 
therefore advised to consult the metadata and to exercise caution when using the 
DO data beyond the initial 96-hour time period.  However, this potential drift 
is not always problematic for some uses of the data, i.e., periodicity analysis.  
It should also be noted that the amount of fouling is very site specific and 
that not all data are affected.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR 
site should be contacted concerning the reliability of the DO data because of 
the site and seasonal variation in the fouling of the DO sensor.

Depth qualifier:  The NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program uses YSI datasondes 
that can be equipped with either depth or water level sensors.  Both sensors 
measure water depth, but by convention, level sensors refer to atmospherically-
vented measurements and depth refers to non-vented measurements.  Standard 
calibration protocols for the non-vented sensor use the atmospheric 
pressure at the time of calibration.  Therefore, changes in atmospheric pressure 
between calibrations appear as changes in water depth.  The error is equal to 
approximately 1.03 cm for every 1 millibar change in atmospheric pressure.  This 
error is eliminated for level sensors because they are vented to the atmosphere 
throughout the deployment time interval.  If proper atmospheric pressure data 
are available, non-vented sensor depth measurements can be corrected for 
deployments between calibrations.  Reading for both vented and non-vented depth 
data are automatically compensated for water density changes due to variations 
in temperature and salinity.  The Research Coordinator at the specific NERR site 
should be contacted in order to obtain information regarding atmospheric 
pressure data availability.

Winchester

a.	Low pH values are consistent with high precipitation events at this site.  
Post-deployment calibration at pH 7.0 on 01/21/03 was 6.92.  The data were not 
deleted.

b.	The following Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range:

	01/13/03 	11:30:00
	01/15/03 	14:00:00

c.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration on 01/21/03 was 1.5 NTU.  No 
debris was noted on the probe face or wiper and the data were not deleted.

Sengstacken
a.	Short DO drops occurred during the month, probably due to high 
precipitation.  Post-deployment calibration was high at 106.7%.  The readings 
recovered to normal levels and the data were not deleted.
01/15/03 	16:30:00, 19:00:00 
01/28/03 	15:30:00 – 17:30:00 

b.	The following records include Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU) that occurred 
during high precipitation events.  Post-deployment calibration was –0.1 NTU on 
02/20/03 and the data were not deleted.
01/26/03 	12:30:00 – 14:30:00

	01/08/03	11:30:00
	01/11/03	12:30:00

b.	The sudden drop in DO in the following record indicates a short-term event 
probably caused by high precipitation.  Values recovered so the data were not 
deleted.

Winchester
a.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  No debris was noted on the probe face or wiper that might 
have contributed to the noisy readings.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.1 NTU 
in 0 NTU standard on 02/20/03, indicating that the sensor was accurate during 
the deployment, so the data were not deleted. 
02/07/03 	13:00:00 
02/16/03 	22:30:00 

b.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.16 m) correspond to low tides.  
However the negative Depth does not occur during much lower spring tides.  This 
suggests that large atmospheric pressure systems common in winter probably 
account for the non-vented depth probe values.  Post-deployment calibration on 
02/20/03 was 0.074 m and 03/18/03 was0.015 m.  Since there ere no SpCond, DO, pH 
or Temp fluctuations consistent with the sonde being out of the water, 
the data were not deleted.

Sengstacken
a.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU) that mostly occur during 
low tides, and are probably caused by transient debris in the pool around the 
sonde.  Post-deployment calibration was -0.1 NTU on 02/20/03 and 0.0 NTU on 
03/18/03.  No debris was noted on the probe face or wiper and the data were not 
deleted.

02/27/03 	15:00:00, 19:30:00 - 20:00:00 

b.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.15 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration on 02/20/03 was 0.090 m and on 03/18/03 was 0.011 m.  
Although there were some SpCond, DO, pH or Temp fluctuations, they were 
consistent with values expected from the inflow of fresh water at this riverine 
site.

c.	Low DO values (to 40.2%) occurred during spring low tides but also when 
precipitation was high.  Post-deployment calibration was a bit high at 103.4% on 
03/18/03.  The data were not deleted.

b.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  All spikes occurred following deployment on 02/21/03 and 
precipitation levels were low.  No debris was noted on the probe face or wiper, 
post-deployment calibration was acceptable at 0.9 NTU, so the data were not 
deleted.

March 1-31, 2003

Winchester
a.	This record contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  No debris was noted on the probe face or wiper.  Post-
deployment calibration was 0.6 NTU in 0 NTU standard on 03/18/03, indicating 
that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the datum was not 
deleted. 
	03/01/03 	13:00:00 

b.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.26 m) similar to those recorded in 
February correspond to spring low tides and are consistent with winter trends at 
this site.  Post-deployment calibration on 03/18/03 was 0.015 m and on 04/14/03 
was –0.095 m.  There were some SpCond, DO, pH or Temp fluctuations but they were 
consistent with values expected from the inflow of fresh water at this riverine 
site.

Sengstacken
a.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.0 NTU on both 03/18/03 and

	03/25/03 	12:30:00 – 15:00:00

b.	There were many zero or negative Depth values (to –0.30 m) that correspond 
to low tides but are also affected by atmospheric pressure changes during winter 
storms.  Post-deployment calibration on 03/18/03 was 0.011 m and on 04/15/03 was 
-0.089 m.  There were some SpCond, DO, pH or Temp fluctuations but they were 
consistent with values expected from the inflow of fresh water at this site.

c.	The DO varied from 15.0 to 107.0% during the month, which is common for 
this site.  Post-deployment calibrations were 103.4% on 03/18/03 and 103.5% on 
04/14/03.  DO charge and gain were within range and there were no defects in the 
membranes, so the data were not deleted.

a.	Data from 03/07/03 through 03/14/03 showed obvious effects of high 
precipitation.

b.	The following records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused 
by transient debris from large precipitation events.  Most of the spikes 
occurred during the deployment on 02/21/03.  No debris was noted on the probe 
face or wiper, post-deployment calibration was acceptable at 0.2 NTU, so the 
data were not deleted.

c.	From 03/01/03 08:30:00 to 03/04/03 at 06:00:00, the DO gradually rose and 
then dropped quickly.  During post-deployment calibration, a slight tear was 
observed in the membrane, although the calibration value was acceptable at 
95.1%.  The following date were deleted:

a.	There were many zero or negative Depth values (to –0.12 m) that 
corresponded to spring low tides.  Post-deployment calibration on 04/14/03 was –
0.095 m and on 05/12/02 was 0.061 m.  There were no SpCond, DO, pH or Temp 
fluctuations consistent with the sonde being out of the water, so data were not

for this site.
	04/22/03 	15:30:00 - 16:00:00

c.	There was a short pH drop, but the sensor recovered so the event was 
probably real.
	04/26/03 	 08:00:00

d.	This record contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by

c.	Many zero or negative Depth values (to –0.20m) correspond to spring low 
tides.  Post-deployment calibration on 04/14/03 was –0.089 m and on 05/12/02 was 
0.065 m.  There were some SpCond, DO, pH or Temp fluctuations but they were 
consistent with values expected from the inflow of fresh water at this site. 

d.	DO was variable, ranging from 4.7 to 116.0%, which is possible for this 
site since the sonde can become isolated from the main channel during extreme 
low tides.  Given the high air temperature, DO could be depleted until flood 
tide reconnects the pool to the main channel.

Winchester
a.	The DO was variable (45.3 to 141.3%) with high DO values occurring during 
flooding spring tides.  This is common for this site.  During low tides the site 
may be isolated from the main channel, so it is possible for DO to be depleted 
due to environmental conditions, with high DO values occurring when the main 
channel floods the pool.  The post-deployment calibration was 102.8% on 05/12/03 
and 104.4% on 06/01/03.  There were transient DO drops in the following 
records that occurred during ebbing tides.  The values recovered to normal 
levels and the data were not deleted:
	05/22/03 	06:00:00 – 07:00:00

b.	The DO was variable (7.0 to 146.4%) with high DO values occurring during 
flooding spring tides, which is common for this site.  During low tides the site 
may be isolated from the main channel, so it is possible for DO to be depleted 
due to environmental conditions, with high DO values occurring when the main

d.	This record contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.4 NTU on 05/12/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the datum was 
not deleted.

Valino
a.	Changes in SpCond, Temp, DO, pH, and Turbidity indicated the sonde was out 
of the water during an 11.8' tidal exchange.  The following data were deleted:
	05/17/03 	07:00:00 – 07:30:00
	05/18/03 	07:30:00 – 08:30:00
Also, the following records show only changes in Sp Cond, and due to the large 
spring tide, the sensor was probably close to the air/water interface.  There 
was no significant precipitation that would correlate with the Sp Cond changes, 
but since the sensor was not out of the water, these data were not deleted:
	05/16/03 	06:30:00
	05/19/03 	08:30:00

b.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.7 NTU on 05/12/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the data were 
not deleted.

a.	During a large spring tide, the sonde was out of the water.  The following 
data were deleted:
	05/17/2003 	06:30:00 - 07:00:00
	05/18/2003 	07:00:00 - 08:00:00

b.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  No debris was noted on the probe face or wiper and the data 
were not deleted.

c.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of sensor range: 
	05/08/03	09:30:00
	05/09/03	10:00:00

d.	Zero Depth was recorded in the following record, but the SpCond did not 
change, so the datum was not deleted:

Winchester
a.	There were many zero or negative Depth values (to –0.13 m) that 
corresponded to spring low as well as neap tides.  Post-deployment calibration 
on 06/26/03 was -0.007 m and on 07/17/03 was -0.015 m.  Although precipitation 
was low, in similar instances in previous years we assumed that the sensors were 
out of the water.  However, the flooding of fresh water around the sonde at 
tide change could also account for the changes reflected in SpCond, DO, pH and 
Temp.  Also, given that the depth sensor is situated above the sensor array, 
until it can be definitively shown that the sensors are out of the water, the 
data will not be deleted.
	
b.	Variable DO is common at this site during spring and summer (values 
ranging from 4.9% to 141.9%).  Daily high air Temperatures for the month ranged 
from 14-24 oC.  Because this site is isolated from the main channel during low 
tides, it is possible for DO to be depleted due to environmental conditions.  
However, the low DO values do not always occur during the lowest Depth, so it is 
not likely that a clump of debris caused the low values.  The post-deployment 
calibration was 102.2% on 06/26/03 and 102.3% on 07/17/03, the membranes were 
intact, and passed the integrity test.  The data were not deleted.

c.	This record contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.7 NTU on 06/26/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the datum was 
not deleted. 
	06/08/03 	15:00:00
	
Sengstacken
a.	Many zero or negative Depth values (to –0.11 m) correspond to spring low 
tides.  Post-deployment calibration on 06/26/03 was –0.002 m and on 07/17/03 was 
-0.014 m.  There were no SpCond, DO, pH or Temp fluctuations consistent with the 
sonde being out of the water, so data were not deleted.

b.	High variability in DO values (18.1 to 149.5%) is common for this site, 
especially during the summer.  Post-deployment calibration values were 103.5% on 
06/26/03 and 102.1% on 07/17/03.

Valino
a.	Changes in SpCond, Temp, DO, pH, and Turbidity indicated the sonde was out 
of the water during a 12.0' tidal exchange.  The following data were deleted:
	06/15/03 	07:00:00

b.	This record contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.8 NTU on 07/17/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the data were 
not deleted. 
	06/28/03 	11:00:00
	
c.	Negative and low Depth values (to -0.5 m) occurred during spring tides.  
No changes in SpCond were seen so data were not deleted.  Post-deployment 
calibrations were -0.016 on 06/26/03 and -0.032 on 07/17/03.
	06/14/03		05:30:00 - 06:30:00
	06/15/03		07:30:00
	06/16/03		07:30:00, 08:00:00
	
d.	Variable DO is common in summer at this site (range 02.5% to 133.3%), 
however post–deployment calibration was 94.1% on 06/26/03 and 116.9% on 
07/17/03.  Membranes were examined carefully and no anomalies were seen.  Probes 
were reconditioned following each retrieval and DO gains and charges were well 
within acceptable ranges.  It is possible that the extremely low DO readings 
were the result of biofouling, especially with the large volume of drift algae 
that occurs at this site.  The high readings were consistently associated with 
cold marine water arriving at the sonde during a flooding tide.  Because pH 
values closely follow the trend in DO readings, it was decided that the data are 
real and they were not deleted or adjusted.  Especially low values were recorded 
on the following date:
	06/30/03		07:00:00, 08:00:00, 19:00:00

Charleston Bridge
	
a.	This Turbidity datum was deleted as it was out of range: 
	06/25/2003	11:00:00

b.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris that is common for this site.  Post-deployment calibrations 
were 0.6 NTU on 06/26/03 and the data were not deleted. 
	06/16/03	11:00:00
	06/25/2003	22:00:00, 22:30:00
c.	Frequent Turbidity spikes were noted in the 06/27/03 to 07/18/03 
deployment.  During the post-cal it was noted that the EDS had some drift algae 
that may have interfered with the Turbidity readings.  The post-calibration 
value was high at 9.2 NTU on 07/17/03, so the following data were deleted:
	06/27/2003	19:30:00 – 06/30/03	23:30:00

d.	Temperatures during the month ranged from 8.2 to 17.0 C, but warm air 
temperatures are consistent with these values.

e.	DO values varied from 43.4 – 144.3%, with the lowest series occurring on 
06/28/03 21:00:00 to 06/29/03 01:00:00 during a flooding spring tide.  Post-
deployment values were acceptable and no membrane tears were observed.  The data 
were not deleted.

Winchester
a.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.09 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was –0.015 m on 07/17/03 and -0.057 m on 08/14/03.  
No changes in SpCond indicated that the sonde was not out of the water so data 
were not deleted. 

b.	High variability in DO values (38.0 to 156.5%) is common for this site, 
especially during the summer.  The post-deployment calibration was 102.3% on 
07/17/03 and erratic on 08/14/03. 

Sengstacken
a.	High variability in DO values (10.9 to 150.2%) is not unusual for this 
site, especially during the summer.

b.	A small increase in Turbidity was noted on 07/02/03 from 13:00:00 to 
13:30:00.  This is probably due to the Smithsonian research project (SERC) on 
larval settlement that required attaching settling plates to the YSI station.  
Turbidity may have been increased due to walking in the area, although it could 
also be due to a flooding tide.  Data were not deleted.

c.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.4 NTU on 08/14/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the data were 
not deleted. 
	07/17/03 	00:00:00, 14:00:00
	07/27/03 	16:30:00
	A cluster of smaller spikes occurred from 07/16/03 01:30:00 through 
07/17/03 00:00:00 for unknown reasons.

d.	Negative and low Depth values (to –0.06 m) occurred during spring tides.  
No changes in SpCond that would indicate the sonde was out of the water were 
seen so data were not deleted.  Post-deployment calibration was -0.014 m on 
07/17/03 and -0.053 m on 08/14/03.

Valino
a.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 1.0 NTU on 08/14/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the data were 
not deleted. 
	07/24/03 	17:30:00, 19:00:00, 19:30:00
	07/25/03		22:00:00
	
b.	On 07/02/03 at 08:30:00, Turbidity was slightly increased, possibly due to 
installation of the SERC plates (see Sengstacken note above).  The datum was not 
deleted.
	
c.	Negative and low Depth values occurred during spring tides.  No changes in 
SpCond were seen so data were not deleted.  Post-deployment calibration was -
0.032 m on 07/17/03. 
	07/13/03		06:00:00
	07/14/03		06:30:00, 07:00:00

d.	Variable DO is common in summer at this site (range –03.4% to 147.6%), and 
post–deployment calibrations were 117.9% on 07/17/03 and 98.9% on 08/14/03.  
Membranes were examined carefully and no anomalies were seen.  Probes were 
reconditioned following each retrieval and DO gains and charges were well within 
acceptable ranges.  Because this is the time of maximum algal detritus, we 
suspect that a large algal mass accumulated around the ABS tube, causing 
attenuation of most sensors.  Turbidity was low because the mass was at water 
level and did not extend to the level of the turbidity optical sensor.  This was 
confirmed on 07/02/03 when we visited the site for the SERC installation of 
barnacle settlement plates.  At that time we removed a large algal mat from the 
sonde ABS tube.  This change is evident in the data, but by 07/05/03, 
sufficient mass must have re-accumulated.  A sudden change occurred on 07/24/03 
at about 04:00:00 when the DO and other sensors rebounded to normal variability.  
This is consistent with the algal mass becoming free.  As is usual for this 
site, the high readings were consistently associated with cold marine water 
arriving at the sonde during a flooding tide.  The data were not deleted or 
adjusted.

Charleston Bridge
a.	On retrieval on 07/17/03 at 10:30:00, it was noted that a large mass of 
algae was wrapped around the turbidity and chlorophyll probes.  The following 
turbidity data were deleted:
	07/01/03 	00:00:00 – 07/17/03	10:30:00
b.	Despite the fouling, the graduate students did not install protective 
screening 
prior to re- deployment and were required to remove the sonde a week after 
redeployment and install the mesh on 07/24/03 at 08:40:00.  Minor fouling was 
reported and the following data were deleted: 
	07/19/03 	15:30:00 – 07/24/03	08:30:00

c.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range: 
   07/25/2003	17:30:00

d.	The following short-term drops in pH in the following records were 
probably due to natural causes.  The probe post-calibrated well (7.08 on 
07/17/03) and was within acceptable sensor ranges.  The data were not deleted.
	07/05/03 	10:30:00 – 13:30:00, 17:00:00 – 21:00:00
	07/15/03 	00:30:00

e.	High variability in DO values (14.0 to 160.5%) is common for this site, 
especially during the summer.  Typically, the lower range of values occurs 
during the low tides and neap tide series.  The lowest value (14.0%) occurred on 
07/03/03 at 01:00:00 and rebounded to normal levels by the next data 
acquisition.  Post-deployment calibration was 103.5% on 07/17/03 and 105.5% on 
08/14/03.  The data were not deleted.

August 1-31, 2003

Winchester
a.	A bad battery cell caused the sonde to stop sampling.  The following data 
are missing:
	08/05/03	15:30:00 - 08/15/03	13:00:00

b.	This Turbidity datum was deleted as it was out of range: 
	08/16/03	13:00:00

c.		This datum contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 1.2 NTU on 09/08/03, 
indicating that the sensor was accurate during the deployment, so the datum was 
not deleted. 
	08/27/03	23:30:00

d.	Negative and low Depth values (to -0.06 m) occurred during low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was 0.041 m on -0.057 m on 08/14/03 and -0.043 m on 
09/08/03.  Low SpCond values may suggest that the sonde was out of the water, 
although the inflow of pooled fresh water during low tide could also explain the 
data trend.  The following data were not deleted:
	08/25/03	06:30:00 - 07:00:00
	08/26/03	07:30:00
	08/27/03	08:00:00 – 08:30:00

	08/29/03	09:00:00 – 09:30:00
	08/30/03	09:30:00

e.	High variability in DO values (28.4 to 141.7%) is common for this site, 
especially during the summer.  Typically, the lower range of values occurs 
during the low tides and neap tide series.  Because of the battery failure, no 
post-deployment calibration was available on 08/14/03 and was high at 107.1% on 
09/08/03.  The data were not deleted.

Sengstacken
a.	High variability in DO values (13.5 to 169.1%) is not unusual for this 
site, especially during the summer.

b.	The following records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused 
by transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 0.4 NTU on 08/14/03 and 
2.0 NTU on 09/08/03, and the data were not deleted.

	08/29/03 	06:30:00

c.	Negative and low Depth values (to –0.07 m) occurred during spring tides.  
No changes in SpCond that would indicate the sonde was out of the water were 
seen so data were not deleted.  Post-deployment calibration was -0.053 m on 
08/14/03 and  -0.055 m on 09/08/03.

d.	Higher than normal pH values occurred during the 08/15/03 to 09/08/03 
deployment that were coincident with flooding tides.  During calibration, the 
probe was out of range and was soaked in 1M HCl.  The mV dropped from –46.2 to 
+15.0 in pH 7.0 buffer and from –208.2 to -160.7 in pH 10 buffer, so the probe 
was deployed.  However, on retrieval, it post-calibrated at 7.98, so the 
values are probably high.  The pH probe was replaced for the next deployment.

Valino
EDS sonde installed on 08/15/03.

a.	These records contain Turbidity spikes (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  Post-deployment calibration was 1.0 NTU on 08/14/03,

post–deployment calibrations were 98.9% on 08/14/03 and 102.1% on 09/08/03.  The 
data were not deleted or adjusted.

d.	The time stamp on the half hour was off by 1 second and a software patch 
from YSI was installed. 

Charleston Bridge
a.	The technicians who deployed the sonde did not notice that it did not 
reach the bottom of the ABS tube.  Since it was not at the correct level all 
data were deleted:
	08/15/03 	13:00:00 – 08/31/03	23:30:00

b.	High variability in DO values (54.9 to 175.0%) continued and is common for 
this site, especially during the summer.  Post-deployment calibration was 105.5% 
on 08/14/03 and the data were not deleted.

September 1-30, 2003

Winchester
a.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.1 m) correspond to low tides.  Post-
deployment calibration was –0.043 on 09/08/03 and -0.001 m on 10/06/03.  Low 
SpCond values may suggest that the sonde was out of the water, although the 
inflow of pooled fresh water during low tide could also explain the data trend.  
The following data were not deleted, despite drops in SpCond:

d.	High variability in DO values (from 18.9 to 129.8%) is not unusual for 
this site, especially during the summer.  Most of the extreme low values 
occurred during the ebbing tides, while the highest values occurred during 
flooding tides. 
   
Sengstacken
a.	High variability in DO values (4.7 to 181.4%) is not unusual for this 
site, especially during the summer.  Most of the extreme low values occurred 
during the neap tides, while the highest values occurred during flooding tides.

d.	Many negative and low Depth (to –0.11m) and low SpCond values occurred 
during spring tides.  However, the tide level was not particularly low and the 
lowest depths showed no changes in SpCond that would indicate the sonde was out 
of the water.  It is possible that the pool of fresh water that forms above the 
site during high tides causes the fluctuations seen in SpCond, DO, pH, and Temp.  
The following records show sudden drops in SpCond, but the data were not 
deleted:

Valino

a.	Variable DO is common in summer at this site (range 56.8% to 147.3%).  The 
DO level began to rise about 09/21/03 and continued until the end of deployment.  
Temperature and pH tended to decrease during this period while SpCond rose.  
Post–deployment calibration was high at 111.0% on 10/06/03.  Although this 
effect looked like biofouling, the installation of the new EDS sonde made that 
unlikely.  No other explanation was noted and the data were not deleted.

b.	A change in Salinity was noted about 09/29/03 at about 21:30:00 when the 
trace got noisy and dropped slightly.  No precipitation events had occurred for 
2 weeks.  The post-deployment calibration was slightly high at 10.38, but the 
sensor cell constant was acceptable.  No explanation could be found for the 
change in the recording, so the data were not deleted or adjusted.

a.	The following data were deleted due to a deployment error (see 08/03 
above). 
	09/01/03 	00:00:00 – 09/08/03	09:00:00

b.	This record contains a Turbidity spike (>150 NTU), probably caused by 
transient debris.  The post-deployment calibration was 0.6 NTU on 10/06/03.  No 
debris was noted on the probe face or wiper and the datum was not deleted.

Winchester
a.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.04 m) correspond to low tides.  Post-
deployment calibration was -0.001 m on 10/06/03 and 0.056 m on 11/06/03.  During 
the rainy season, low SpCond at this station is usually due to high 
precipitation.  However, even without rain, this riverine station always has 
some level of fresh water that causes low SpCond and Salinity.  As in the 
previous two months, it was difficult to tell whether the sonde was out of the 
water.  But, similar fluctuations occurred during small negative depths this 
month.  In the following records, changes in SpCond, Temp, and pH could have 
been the result of freshwater influx during low tides so and the data were not 
deleted:
	10/01/03 	00:00:00, 23:00:00 – 23:30:00
	10/02/03 	00:00:00 – 01:00:00

	10/31/03 	00:00:00 – 01:00:00, 23:00:00 – 23:30:00

b.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range: 
	10/10/03	00:30:00
	10/13/03	22:00:00

c.	These Turbidity data exceeded 150 NTU, but were probably the result of 
transient debris.  Post–deployment calibrations were 0.6 NTU on 10/06/03 and 3.1 
NTU on 11/06/03.  The data were not deleted. 
	10/01/03	23:30:00

	10/13/03	08:00:00

d.	Variable DO (from 40.6 to 119.6%) is common for this site.  Post-
deployment calibrations were 104.9% on 10/06/03 and high at 112.5% on 11/06/03.  
The data were not deleted. 

Sengstacken
a.	High variability in DO values (16.7 to 129.51%) is not unusual for this 
site.  A sudden DO drop occurred on 10/22/03 from 05:00:00 to 05:30:00.  This 
occurred during a high precipitation event and was probably related.  Values 
returned to normal so the data were not deleted.

b.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range: 
	10/20/03	01:30:00
	10/22/03	23:30:00
	10/27/03	00:30:00

c.	These Turbidity data exceeded 150 NTU, but were probably the result of 
transient debris following high tides and precipitation.  Post-deployment 
calibration values were 0.4 NTU on 10/06/03 and 1.1 NTU on 11/06/03.  The data 
were not deleted.

d.	Negative and low Depth (to –0.02 m) values occurred during spring tides 
and low SpCond (to 0.05 mS/cm) values occurred almost every day, which is normal 
for this site.  The tide level was not particularly low and the lowest depths 
showed no changes in SpCond that would indicate the sonde was out of the water.  
Some frequent, small precipitation events contributed to the lowest 
SpCond values.  The post-deployment calibration was normal at 9.96 mS/cm on 
10/06/03 and somewhat low at 9.49 mS/cm on 11/06/03.

e.	The pH probe malfunctioned on 10/07/03.  The following pH data were 
deleted:
	10/07/03 06:00:00 – 10/31/03 23:30:00

f.	Low temperatures occurred on 10/31/03 from 00:30:00 – 02:00:00, coincident 
with low air temperatures.  The data were not deleted.

Valino
a.	The following DO data was high and may have been due to biofouling or 
other environmental event.  Data were not deleted – see 09/03 above:
	10/01/03	00:00:00 – 10/06/03	10:00:00

Charleston Bridge
a.	Near the end of the second deployment for this month, a change in most of 
the sensor readings was noted.  When the sonde was retrieved on 11/06/03, there 
was a lot of drift algae and debris clogging the protective mesh around the 
sonde.  The unusual data may have resulted from decreased water flow.  However, 
similar clogging on previous occasions has not resulted in similar changes in 
data.  The following data were not deleted:
	10/31/03 	10:00:00 – 23:30:00

November 1-30, 2003

Winchester
a.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.07 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was 0.056 on 11/06/03 and 0.089 on 12/03/03.

b.	There were many low SpCond values that were probably due to rainfall 
throughout the month.  No data were deleted. 

c.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range: 
	11/09/03	20:00:00
	11/27/03	22:30:00

Sengstacken
a.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range: 
	11/04/03	21:30:00 – 22:30:00

b.	The following Turbidity data exceeded 150 NTU and were all in the 
deployment ending 11/06/03.  The post-deployment calibration value was1.1 NTU on 
11/06/03.  The data were not deleted. 
	11/01/03	09:00:00 - 09:30:00

	11/05/03	14:00:00

c.	Negative and low Depth (to –0.03 m) values occurred on 11/08/03 from 
17:00:00 – 21:00:00 during a 0.0 ft. tide.  Although the SpCond values were also 
low during this time, the tide was not particularly low, so the data were not 
deleted.  The post-deployment calibration value was higher than normal at 0.128 
m on 12/03/03, but large storm systems during the deployment probably affected 
the values.

d.	Very low SpCond values occurred throughout the month.  Tide levels were 
not particularly low and there were several moderate precipitation events 
preceding the reading, so it is unlikely that the sonde was out of the water.  
Post-deployment calibration was 10.25 mS/cm on 12/03/03, and the data were not 
deleted.

e.	The pH probe malfunctioned and the following pH data were deleted:
	11/01/03	00:00:00 – 11/06/03 10:30:00

f.	Low temperatures occurred in the following records and were coincident 
with low air temperatures.  The data were not deleted:
	11/01/03	00:00:00 – 03:00:00
	11/22/03	20:00:00, 20:30:00
	11/23/03	05:30:00, 06:00:00
   
Valino
a.	Negative and low Depth values occurred during spring tides.  No changes in 
SpCond were seen so data were not deleted. 
	11/25/03	19:30:00 – 20:00:00

Charleston Bridge
a.	Near the end of the deployment 11/6, a change in most of the sensor 
readings was noted (see 10/03 note above).  The following data may be affected 
but were not deleted:
	11/01/03 	00:00:00 – 11/06/03	08:30:00

b.	High Turbidity (>150 NTU) readings correlated well with major 
precipitation events (see Section 15) and were probably caused by transient 
debris.  The post-deployment calibration was 0.2 NTU in 0 NTU standard on 
12/03/03.  At retrieval, sediment on top the sonde was noted, so high turbidity 
levels were expected. 
     
c.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range: 
	11/27/03	06:00:00, 06:30:00, 09:00:00, 16:00:00
	11/30/03	02:00:00, 08:30:00
   
December 1-31, 2003

Winchester
a.	An especially large number of Turbidity spikes occurred during the month, 
beginning on 12/13/03.  This is coincident with a 5-year precipitation event of 
102.87 mm and runoff plus subsequent precipitation could have increased values 
to these levels.  The post-deployment calibration was acceptable at –1.4 NTU.  
The following data were out of range and were deleted: 
	12/14/03	09:00:00
	12/18/03	04:00:00, 06:00:00, 18:30:00 – 19:30:00
	12/19/03	05:30:00 – 06:30:00, 08:30:00, 19:30:00 – 21:00:00
	12/20/03	04:00:00 – 04:30:00
	12/29/03	22:30:00

b.	Zero or negative Depth values (to –0.22 m) correspond to spring low tides.  
Post-deployment calibration was 0.089 on 12/03/03 and 0.104 on 01/05/04.  Winter 
storms produce large changes in barometric pressure that affect the non-vented 
depth sensor.  It is unlikely that the sonde was out of the water given the high 
volume of precipitation and resulting runoff which would cause the fluctuations 
apparent in SpCond, Temp, and pH values.

c.	Large drops in DO occurred during ebbing spring tides in the following 
records.  They were probably due to large amounts of decaying vegetation washed 
from the marsh by the high rainfall and large December tides.  Post-deployment 
calibration on 01/05/04 was 103.1%.  The data were not deleted.
	12/21/03	02:00:00

	12/26/03	06:30:00
	12/27/03	05:00:00

Sengstacken
a.	The effects of a major 5-year precipitation event are apparent in the 
large drops in SpCond and pH, beginning on 12/13/03 at 17:00:00.

b.	DO values dropped suddenly on 12/18/03 from 15:00:00 – 16:30:00 which is 
normal for this site.  The post-deployment calibration was 103.1% on 01/05/04 
and the data were not deleted.

c.	The following Turbidity data exceeded 150 NTU and were all in the 
deployment ending 01/05/04.  The post-deployment calibration value was 0.5 NTU 
and the data were not deleted. 
	12/12/03	21:30:00 – 23:30:00
	12/13/03	00:00:00 – 00:30:00
	12/24/03	19:30:00 – 21:30:00
	12/27/03	20:30:00
	12/28/03	21:00:00

d.	Negative and low Depth (to –0.18 m) values occurred throughout the month 
during low tides.  No changes in SpCond values were were coincident with the low 
Depths, so the data were not deleted.  The post-deployment calibration was 0.153 
m 01/05/04.
    
Valino
a.	These Turbidity data were deleted as they were out of range:
	12/17/03 	09:30:00
	12/23/03 	04:30:00

b.	Negative and low Depth values occurred during spring tides.  No changes in 
SpCond were seen so data were not deleted.  Post-deployment calibration was -
0.001 m on 01/05/04.
	12/22/03 	17:30:00
	12/23/03 	18:00:00 – 18:30:00

c.	High precipitation produced large effects on the data, especially on 
12/13/03 following a rainfall event exceeding 100 mm. 

Charleston Bridge
a.	There were many high Turbidity readings during the 12/03/03 – 01/05/04 
deployment that were probably caused by significant rain events (see Section 
15).  Post-deployment calibration was 0.6 NTU.  The following data were deleted 
because they exceed the expected maximum response to precipitation and runoff of  
detritus from the watershed:
	12/06/03	11:00:00, 13:00:00, 19:00:00
	12/07/03	04:00:00, 04:30:00, 06:00:00, 06:30:00

14:00:00, 17:30:00, 
18:00:00, 19:00:00, 20:00:00 - 22:30:00
	12/27/03	00:30:00 - 02:00:00

b.	Turbidity values reflected high background due to precipitation.  The 
following records (>150 NTU) were not deleted. 
	12/01/03	20:00:00	
	12/02/03	14:00:00, 14:30:00, 17:00:00

	12/24/03 – 12/27/03 multiple times
	12/29/03	16:30:00

c.	The following records contain changes in DO, pH, SpCond, and Temp that are 
due to precipitation.  The Depth was at least 1 m so the sonde was not out of 
the water.  The data were not deleted as the readings returned to their previous 
levels. 
	12/13/03	17:00:00 – 12/18/03	07:00:00
	12/29/03	20:00:00 – 12/31/03	23:30:00

12)	Missing data

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Periods were later 
removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre- and post-) problems.  For more details on deleted data, 
see Section 11 (Anomalous Data).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

Field calibrations were recorded with YSI600QS immediately prior to sonde 
deployment and retrieval.  The probe was deployed to the same level as the sonde 
and data were recorded as near as possible to whole or half hour YSI 6600 
sampling times.  Comparisons between YSI sonde and field instrument recordings 
were kept in a spreadsheet.  Values differing by more than 5% were noted.  
Occasional discrepancies were noted at the riverine monitoring stations where it 
is possible that sub-surface microcurrents are responsible.  If readings are 
taken at flood or ebb tide, it is possible that the current displaces the 600QS 
probe away from the 6600, which could account for discrepancies.
