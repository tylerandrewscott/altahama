2.  Entry verification 
The data are uploaded to the PC from the YSI dataloggers. Data plots are 
produced and examined using the PC6000 software. Files are also uploaded to a PC 
in a comma delimited format. Comma delimited files are opened in EXCEL 5.0 
software and edited by removing unnecessary headers, footers and spaces.  
Suspect data are evaluated, edited, and documented.  Missing data due to YSI 
maintenance (down time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by 
periods (.).  Edited and raw files are archived using a SUN Sparc II 
workstation.  Edited files are merged to contain one full month of data. All 
1995 Thousand Acre and Caledonia files have been verified using Microsoft Excel 
5.0 macro programs which discover outliers (values which fall outside the range 
that the instrument is designed to measure - see section II.8 of this document) 
and other erroneous data.  Outliers were determined according to the 
instruments' manufacturers manual.  After macros were run, files with suspicious 
data were charted in Microsoft Excel to determine problems with probes.  The 
dissolved oxygen (DO) probe was most problematic.  When the plot of DO ran 
upward in an exponential fashion and also intermittently went outside the range 
that the instrument was designed to measure and never returned to normal 
readings, the data were considered bad and removed from the data file.  These  
macros are available on the NERRS CDMO home page.  Elizabeth King edited and 
archived the January-May 1995 Thousand Acre data. Chris Spruck edited and 
archived June-December 1995 data.  Tammy Dorman used the newly revised macro 
from March 11, 1997 and re-edited the data.  Christopher Aadland and Rick 
Clutter proofed the final edited metadata and edited data files.  During the 
fall of 1998 through January 1999,Ginger Ogburn-Matthews and Tonia Robinson 
revisited the 1995 data to investigate "odd" data peaks in the database.  
Additional anomalous data peaks have been described in this metadata, and some 
bad data which were found were removed and documented in January 1999.

3.  Research Objectives 
The objective of our project was to compare the water quality of a freshwater 
tidal creek, Caledonia Creek (CA), receiving runoff from a golf course to that 
of a tidal creek in Winyah Bay  (TA), down river of the golf course and within 
the NIW NERR boundaries.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes over three 
week periods at the Caledonia Golf Course and over two week periods at the 
Thousand Acre station.  
 
4.  Research methods (YSI dataloggers) 
Prior to the YSI Datalogger deployment, a 4" diameter PVC pipe was strapped to a 
treated 2" X 6" board; this board was then nailed into a pier piling at the 
Thousand Acre site and into a free  standing 4" x 4" at the Caledonia site.  
Each YSI Datalogger is lowered into a PVC pipe which has two large windows cut 
out near the bottom for the probes to have direct contact with the water column.  
A stop bolt placed through the PVC pipe below the cut out windows maintains the 
YSI Datalogger at each site exactly one foot (30 cm) above the creek bottom.  
Every half hour over a two week period for Thousand Acre and a three week period 
for Caledonia, measurements of specific conductivity, salinity, percent 
saturation, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, Turbidity (CA site only), 
and water level are recorded.  Sampling intervals  were selected due to 
biofouling of the dissolved oxygen membrane and expected battery life.  At the 
end of each sampling interval, the YSI Datalogger is brought back into the 
laboratory for downloading, cleaning and recalibration.  These procedures are 
carried out according to the methods as described in the YSI Operating Manual 
(see sections 3 and 7).  After approximately 24 hours of down time for cleaning 
and overnight recalibration (if necessary), the YSI dataloggers are redeployed.  
If necessary, a Hydrolab datalogger may be substituted for a YSI. All 
maintenance downtimes and membrane cleaning periods are recorded in a log book. 

5.  Site location and character 
The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the 
southeastern coast of the United States on the Atlantic Ocean in two tidal 
estuaries, North Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The 
North Inlet estuary, located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-
built Class C type estuary (Pritchard, 1955)1.  The North Inlet estuary is 
composed of numerous winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal 
estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 
area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to 
the north.  The Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by 
Pritchard (1955)1, which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North 
Carolina, is one of the largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern 
Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the 
sub-basins of 6 major rivers which are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, 
and industry.  The rivers drain approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  
Descriptions of the two sampling stations are as follows: 
 
1)  Thousand Acre (TA) - (lat. 33:18:2; long. 79:15:4) The Thousand Acre 
monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek approximately 30 
meters northeast of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh.  The creek empties 
into the northern side of the mid portion of Winyah Bay and directly drains pine 
forested upland and wetlands. Salinity ranges from 0 to 15 ppt.  Georgetown, 5 
km upstream from the Thousand Acre site and on the southern side of Winyah Bay, 
is the home port for a number of heavy industries including a steel plant, paper 
mill, chemical plant, and a coal fired power plant.  A public sewage treatment 
plant is also located in Georgetown. 
 
2)  Caledonia Golf Course(CA) - (lat. 33:27; long. 79:10) The Caledonia site is 
located in a rectangular man-made pond, which is open on the western side to the 
headwaters of the tidally influenced Caledonia Creek.  The datalogger is located 
approximately 8 meters from the bank of the eastern corner of the pond.  A 
freshwater holding pond that is designed to receive runoff from the golf course, 
drains into the man-made pond where the datalogger is located.  A portion of 
Caledonia Creek borders the Caledonia Golf Course and drains into the Waccamaw 
River.  The site is approximately 15 km upstream from the Thousand Acre site, 
and salinities are typically less than 0.5 ppt.  
 
6.  Data collection period 
Thousand Acre data collection began January 1, 1995, and Caledonia data 
collection began June  6, 1995. All sampling is ongoing. 
 
7.  Associated researchers and projects 
A water chemistry program is associated with the NIW core monitoring program. 
Variables sampled include: chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, nitrate-
nitrite, orthophosphate, and ammonia.  (See  documentation on the NIW WWW home 
page for further details).  TA is our permanent monitoring station for the NERR 
National Monitoring Program.  This station is also included in our NIW core 
monitoring program. Caledonia is not currently included in our water chemistry 
monitoring program.

	DOsat,DOmg/L,Salinity,pH values are questionable
but not Sp Cond - those values look reasonable. A YSI was deployed 05/08 -05/19 
and it 
looks as if the calibrations were off. The pH values constantly decline over the 
course of the 
YSI deployment.

There was a change in variables or in the calibration of the unit between 
05/09/95 11:00-
11:30:00.
There was a rain storm on 05/05/95 and on 05/19/95. All DO and Turbidity data 
was out of 
range of the instrument reading >99999.0.  Hydrolab was used the rest of the
