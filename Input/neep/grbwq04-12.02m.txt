2. Entry verification
The data are transmitted every thirty minutes from YSI 6600 datasondes via VHF 
packet radio using Ecowatch software to a base station PC. Files are first 
examined and graphed using Ecowatch software.  Missing and/or  anomalous data 
are noted. Files are then transferred to a Macintosh computer and opened in 
Microsoft Excel software and edited. Missing data due to routine YSI maintenance 
and probe failure or communication errors are inserted into the spreadsheet and 
denoted by periods (.). Edited files are merged to contain one full month of 
data.  Files are verified by means of CDMO Excel macros. The CDMO cdmomac3.xls 
macro will allow the user to automatically format column widths to the correct 
number decimal places based on the YSI sensor specifications. It also 
allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated file for missing data 
points, fill all cells that do not contain data with periods, and find all data 
points that fall outside the range of what the datalogger is designed to measure 
(outliers). The CDMO import.xls macro will allow PC users with 30-minute data to 
automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert 
periods for missing data. Edited files are merged to contain one full month of 
data. In addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this 
macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing point graphs on a 
monthly basis. All files are graphed in Excel and examined by Jaimie Wolf in 
order that anomalous data points can be identified.



3. Research Objectives
In 2002, YSI 6600 datasondes were deployed in Great Bay and in the Squamscott, 
Oyster and Lamprey Rivers part of the National Estuarine Research Reserves' 
(NERRS) System-wide Monitoring Program (SWMP). The goal is to develop and 
maintain temporally intensive long-term datasets of physio-chemical parameters 
of water quality at locations that are representative of the Great Bay Estuarine 
System. The Great Bay site is relatively unimpacted, while the three tidal river 
sites (Lamprey, Oyster and Squamscott) have large drainage basins and are 
impacted by both point (wastewater treatment plants) and nonpoint sources of 
pollution. In addition to establishing a baseline of water quality, and 
understanding the spatial and temporal variability of important indicators of 
estuarine water quality, the data is used by a number of researchers in the 
analysis of physical and biological processes.

4. Research Methods
Datasondes are programmed to obtain measurements of specific conductivity, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen, percent saturation, pH, temperature, water level, 
and turbidity every half-hour. All sondes used in 2002 were model 6600 equipped 
with non-vented depth sensors. The instruments are deployed continuously during 
ice-free seasons, except for brief periods when they are removed for cleaning, 
maintenance and recalibration. Pre and post-deployment calibrations are 
performed using the diagnostics menu of the YSI Ecowatch program and QA/QC 
procedures developed by NERR Research Coordinators and YSI engineers. 
VWR conductivity and pH standards are used for calibration. Hach formazin is 
used to calibrate turbidity probes. The sonde in Great Bay is deployed in a YSI 
EM 550 buoy, while the Lamprey and Squamscott river stations are piling mounted 
deployments (see below).  Due to shallow depths and narrow channels, the Oyster 
River sonde has to be deployed with the least amount of vertical expression 
above bottom.  This is accomplished by placing it horizontally in a perforated 
PVC pipe with four weighted "legs" to keep the instrument above bottom.  The 
Oyster River sonde is hard-wired to a radio telemetry station on shore 
(approximately 25 meters away). Because the sonde at the central Great Bay site 
(GB) is deployed in an EM 550 surface buoy, it does not measure depth data. 
Depth data for the GB site was obtained using time adjusted water level data 
from the Squamscott River site (SQ).

5. Site Location and Character

Site #1 Great Bay  (GB)
Location
Central area of Great Bay proper.  The coordinates of the deployment are 
43∫ 04' 20" N latitude and 70∫ 52' 10" W longitude.
Salinity range: 5-32 ppt (seasonally); 0-5ppt from high to low tide. However, 
the summer of 2002 was an atypically hot and dry season, which resulted in 
higher than normal salinity values.

Site definitions: GB = Great Bay, SQ = Squamscott River, LR = Lamprey 
River, OR = Oyster River

11. Data Anomalies:
Anomalous data is usually the result of fouling of the probes, probe failure, 
out of range data, or defective equipment. Removed anomalous and retained 
suspect data are listed below. 
Occasionally the values for specific conductivity and salinity will drift 
downward at the end of deployments. This is most likely caused by sediment 
build-up on the probe.

June
No pH data 6/10 1330 to 6/13 1230. pH values plunged to <3. Data was deleted. 
This was a new pH probe, which passed pre-deployment calibration. On the 13th it 
was replaced in the field with a different probe. However, toward the end of the 
deployment the replacement probe recorded steadily dropping below-normal pH 
values. This was evidently an equipment rather than probe failure. 

No depth data 6/11 2200. No corresponding SQ data.
No depth data 6/1/ 0830 to 6/20 0800 no corresponding SQ data.

pH data 6/24 1800 to 6/30 2330 was deleted.

The following dissolved oxygen data was below normal range possibly due to 
interference by floating eelgrass or algae.

July
No depth data 7/11 1400 no corresponding SQ data

No data 7/29 0700 to 0930, 1230 to 1300, 1600 to 1830 , 7/30 0130 to 0900 sonde 
failed to report for unknown reasons.

Dissolved oxygen data 7/1 1630 to 7/3 1430 below normal range probably due to 
end of deployment fouling. Data was deleted.

Dissolved oxygen data from approximately 7/22 until the end of the deployment on 
7/30 0100 is out of range (high) and should be considered suspect. Data was 
retained. Probable end of deployment fouling.

Dissolved oxygen data 7/30 1200 to 2030 well below normal range, possibly due to 
floating eelgrass interfering with the probe. Data was deleted.

7/1 0000 to 7/3 1430 pH data out of range (low 2.6-5.13) due to equipment 
defect. Data was deleted.

The pH data at the beginning of the 7/30 deployment is lower than would be 
expected. Possible probe or equipment malfunction. Data from 7/30 0930 to 7/31 
2330 is suspect but was retained.

7/25 1200 all data was deleted because it appeared the instrument may have 
been lifted out of the water, based on the salinity and depth data.

The following turbidity values were <-0.4 and were deleted.
Date		Time     	Turbidity
7/30/02	12:00:00	-2

August
No depth data 8/5 0930 to 1130 and 8/22 1400 no corresponding SQ data.
The sonde failed to report for unknown reasons on the following dates.
8/29 0030 and 2300, 8/30 0330 to 0430, 0530, 0630 to 1200, 1300, 1400 to 1500, 
1600, 1700 to 2330, 8/31 0000 to 2330

The specific conductivity/temperature probe failed on approximately 8/26 1730. 
(Temperature as high as 50C and salinity 43ppt).
Salinity, specific conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen data from 8/26 
1030 to 8/30 1630 were deleted. Data out of range.
The faulty probe was replaced.

8/6 1500 to 8/7 0530 DO out of range (low) possibly due to eelgrass interfering 
with probe. Data was deleted.

8/24 1030 to 8/25 0730 DO values unusually low, possible eelgrass interference. 
Data is suspect but was retained.

There were 313 turbidity values over 100. These were deleted. However all 
turbidity data from approximately 8/10 to 8/26 should be considered suspect 
because the values are unusually high for this site. Possible probe malfunction. 
The wiper may have stuck over the optics.

There were 150 negative turbidity values <-0.4. Data was deleted.


September
No data 9/1 0000 to 9/11 1000. This instrument ceased recording midway through 
its 8/26 - 9/11 deployment. No cause was found. The batteries were fully 
charged, internal memory had 300 days of logging remaining. The sonde ran well 
in the lab and during subsequent. The reason that it stopped logging is unknown. 

Dissolved oxygen values suddenly plunged on 9/20 1730 and remained abnormally 
low (40 - 53%DO) until 9/26 0430. This occurred for a shorter period of time 
from 9/26 1130 to 1330. During the summer and fall in Great Bay large racks of 
floating eelgrass sometimes become wrapped around the sonde and buoy apparatus, 
thus impeding the flow of water and oxygen, and affecting the probe readings. 
Since this occurred mid-deployment, and the data subsequently recovered, it can 
be assumed that eelgrass or algae was entangled on the datalogger for  a period 
of time. Data was deleted.

9/27 0300 to 9/29 0330 specific conductivity, salinity, temperature data was out 
of range and deleted. There was no obvious reason for this aberrant data. 
Because it occurred mid-deployment and the values returned to normal, fouling 
can probably be ruled out.  Possible temporary interference by floating mats of 
eelgrass or algae.

Dissolved oxygen (mg/L) data was also out of range for this period and was 
deleted. %DO is suspect but retained.

There were 190 negative turbidity values <-0.4. Data was deleted.

The following turbidity data was out of range and deleted.
9/15/02	21:00:00	841.6

October
No data 10/6 0530, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1430, 1900-1930

No data 10/6 2130 to 10/25 1100 (end of deployment). Instrument stopped 
recording for unknown reasons. This sonde worked well in the lab after 
deployment. Battery life was 11.8 volts, 341 days remaining in memory, Ecowatch 
software on 10/25 indicated that the instrument was still logging data. However 
there is no data for the dates listed above. It stopped communicating with the 
1240 radio at the same time it stopped recording data. Several days of erratic 
data precede the end of the data on 10/6.  Occasionally large thick 
mats of floating eelgrass have been found wrapped around the buoy and sonde at 
this site. It's possible that this occurred. This sonde worked well during three 
subsequent deployments at two different sites and its post deployment 
calibrations on 10/25 were acceptable.


10/1 0930 to 10/6 2100 pH, DO, salinity, specific conductivity and temperature 
data were all very aberrant for this period of time, possibly due to eelgrass 
interference. Data was deleted.

10/27 0800 to 10/30 0230 dissolved oxygen data was very erratic and abnormal, 
with percent DO values as low as 41. Possible probe malfunction or fouling. The 
data was deleted.

195 negative turbidity values were deleted.


November
No data 11/8 1500, 11/11 1330, 2200 to 2230, 11/12 0300 to 11/13 0930. The 
instrument failed to record data for unknown reasons.

No dissolved oxygen data 11/4 1600 to 11/8 1430, 11/8 1530. The data was 
extremely out of range, perhaps owing to eelgrass entanglement, and was deleted.

During the second week in November the water temperature rises, rather than 
falling, as would be expected. There was an air temperature warm up that week so 
data is correct.

The following pH value was out of range and deleted.
6.99 at 1000 on 11/13.

There were 196 turbidity values <-0.4 and 283 >100. Data was deleted.

On 11/18 and during the period between 11/21 and 11/17 the turbidity values that 
were retained are unusually high for this site.  It is possible that the probe 
(6136) malfunctioned. The data should be considered suspect.

December
No data for the month of December. On 12/2 the real time data revealed that the 
sonde was out of the water at low tide. It was subsequently determined that the 
entire buoy apparatus broke free of its mooring sometime on 12/1 (a Sunday).
Since it was impossible to know precisely what time this happened, there is no 
December data for the GB site. The buoy and instrument were recovered on shore 
on 12/4.


Squamscott River
April 
There are approximately 34 points where turbidity data were deleted because they 
fell outside the accepted range (>100).

No data 4/1 0000 to 4/10 1500 sonde not yet deployed.

No data 4/20 0200 and 4/27 0200. Sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.

May
No data 5/10 1130 Sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.
No data 5/24 1100 Sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.

No DO data 5/9 1130 to 5/31 2330 Data below acceptable range, probe failure. 
Data were deleted.

178 points turbidity data over 100 were deleted. 

5/28 2230 to 5/30 1800 it appeared the turbidity wiper was stuck over the optics 
during this period since most values were over 1500. Turbidity data deleted.

June
No data 6/11 2330 sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.

Water temperature climbs to above normal range at the end of June - beginning of 
July. However the air temperature for much of that time was in the high 80's to 
low 90's (F). Data is correct.

No DO data 6/1 0000 to 6/18 0830. DO values were well below the acceptable range 
(probably due to probe failure) and were deleted. Post deployment DO calibration 
value on 6/18 was 62.3%.

291 points turbidity over 100 were deleted, including 6/20 0900 to 6/25 1430 
deployment during which the turbidity wiper must have stuck over the optics 
because all values were over 1600 for this period. Defect in turbidity probes 
(6136).

July
63 slightly negative turbidity data ranging from -0.5 to -3.1. These were 
retained.

Three turbidity values over 1000 were deleted.

There were 53 slightly negative turbidity values ranging from -0.5 to -3.5. 
These data were retained.

September
These DO % and mg/L values were out of range and deleted.
9/29/02	13:00:00		150.1	11.76
9/29/02	13:30:00		186.7	14.5

9/28 and 9/29 numerous DO% values fall below 60. These data are below normal 
range and suspect. Data were retained.

These turbidity values were out of range and deleted.
9/20/02	13:00:00	1185.7
9/29/02	2:00:00	990.2

After the 9/12 deployment until the end of the month, depth data is slightly 
higher than usual. This could be due to a blockage in the pvc tube which would 
cause the sonde to sit a bit higher in the water.

October
Dissolved oxygen data aberrant and many points were out of range for the period 
10/1 0000 to 10/3 0900. Probably due to end of deployment fouling. Data was 
deleted.

DO and pH began to rise to aberrant levels shortly after the 10/30 deployment. 
DO and pH data for 10/30 1530 to 2330 was deleted. Possible interference by 
floating eelgrass or algae.

After 10/16 the salinity at low tides is quite a bit lower than during the first 
half of the month.  This is due to large rain events on 10/16 and 10/26. The 
data is correct.

The following negative turbidity data was removed.
Date		Time		Turb
10/30/02	17:00:00	-3.4
10/30/02	20:30:00	-6.2
10/31/02	10:00:00	-4.6

10/31/02	11:00:00	-2.5
10/31/02	11:30:00	-1.2

There were 58 positive turbidity values that were out of range and deleted. Most 
of these occurred during a deployment where the newer (6136) defective turbidity 
probe was employed.

November
The SQ instrument stopped communicating with its radio on 11/8 and resumed on 
11/16. Since 11/16 was a Saturday, it wasn't discovered until 11/18 that the 
temperature probe had failed. (Water temperature recorded as high as 44C.) At 
that time the sonde was replaced at this site. 

11/9 1200 to 11/18 1230 salinity, specific conductivity, temperature data 
deleted(see above). For the same period of time dissolved oxygen mg/L data was 
also deleted because it was aberrant as well. DO probe may have failed, or 
membrane fouled. Post deployment DO% calibration value  was 58.8.

DO data 11/1 0000 to 11/6 1030 steadily rises to out of range levels, possibly 
due to fouling. Data was deleted. The probe had good pre and post deployment 
calibrations. This instrument was an EDS sonde and had to be retrieved after 8 
days of deployment when the radio communication indicated the DO was too high.

DO data 11/12 1930 to 11/18 1230 was deleted due to probe malfunction. 

DO data 11/18 1300 to 11/27 1400, 11/29 1600 to 1900, 11/30 1000 to 1400 and 
1600 to 2300 was extremely aberrant and deleted. There was no obvious reason, 
the instrument had acceptable pre and post deployment calibrations. Possible 
instrument failure.

There were 331 high turbidity values ranging from 103.8 to 1848.5. Most occurred 
during deployment of the defective 6136 turbidity probe. Data was deleted 
through 11/6 1030.  

There were 85 negative turbidity values ranging from -0.5 to -6.7. Data was 
deleted. 

December
No data 12/3 1030 to 12/31 2330. Sonde removed from the water for the winter 
months.

No dissolved oxygen data 12/1 0000 to 12/3  1000.  Data was extremely aberrant 
and deleted. No obvious reason, the probe passed pre and post deployment 
calibrations.

There were 13 turbidity values <-0.4 and >100. These were deleted.

The following dissolved oxygen % and mg/L values were out of range and deleted. 
When the sonde was retrieved on 5/13 the DO membrane had 2 punctures, possibly 
from crabs, which are found in the sonde guards from time to time.

June
When the sonde was redeployed on 5/31 it was placed in a slightly shallower 
location than it had been. This was corrected on 6/6 when the sonde was moved 
back. As a result of the shallower water, the specific conductivity and salinity 
values are lower than at the usual site. The data was retained. 

The following DO data was out of range and deleted:
6/24/02	16:00:00	43.7	3.56

Dissolved oxygen values very high beginning approximately 6/25 until the end of 
the month. Perhaps due to fouling or probe malfunction. Data is retained but 
suspect.

There were 80 out of range turbidity data points ranging from 121.4 to 2644.5. 
Data was deleted. These high values could be caused either by debris or the 
turbidity wiper covering the optics.

There were 90 slightly negative turbidity data points ranging from -1 to -5. 
Data was retained.

July
There were 188 turbidity values that exceeded 100. They ranged from 100.9 to 
2406.4. Data was deleted.

Between 7/1 0000 and 7/16 1500 there were 39  slightly negative turbidity values 
ranging from -0001 to -0004. Data was retained.

During the second July deployment which began 7/16 most turbidity values (571) 
were negative ranging from -0.5 to  -15.1. This instrument was fitted with a new 
turbidity probe that subsequently was found to be defective. All turbidity data 
from 7/16 1530 to 7/31 2330 was deleted.

Dissolved oxygen values 7/1 0000 to 7/3 0930 are out of normal range.  This is 
possibly due to end of deployment probe fouling. Data is retained.

7/7 1600  DO% 13.7 and mg/L  1.03  deleted. Out of range.	

During 7/6 -7/8 some dissolved oxygen values were below the normal range. Data 
is suspect but retained.

August
The salinity and specific conductivity values tail off at the ends of both 
August deployments, (8/9 and 8/20) probably due to sediment fouling. Data is 
retained.

No data 8/10 1600 to 8/11 1530. It was discovered by reviewing live data being 
transmitted from the Oyster River site via 1240 radios that the instrument was 
out of the water at low tide. Apparently it had been moved, perhaps dragged by a 
boat. The instrument was repositioned the following day. Data was deleted.

New YSI 6136 turbidity probes were used for the three August deployments. It was 
later found that these probes were defective. During  two deployments (8/1 to 
8/9 and 8/20 to 8/31) 298 values above the upper range of 99 were found (ranging 
from 99.7 to 419.1) and 184 negative values between -0.5 and -18.1.

All August turbidity data from this site was deleted.

No pH data 8/9 1100 to 8/20 1130. The data was out of range due to equipment 
failure and was deleted. The pH probe was new and had successful pre and post 
deployment calibrations. The sonde was found to have internal problems when it 
was later returned to YSI for repair.

During August dissolved oxygen values often exceeded 130%. This could be due to 
fouling or sediment on the probe membrane. All DO data was retained but %DO 
values over 130 and associated DO mg/l should be considered suspect.

September
No turbidity data 9/1 2030 to 9/5 0930. The above mentioned faulty 6136 
turbidity probe was used during this deployment (which began at the end of 
August). Most values were in excess of 100 with the range 102 - 957.3. Because 
the probe later was found to be defective, all turbidity data during this period 
was deleted. It appears the wiper became stuck over the optics.

The DO levels drop below normal levels towards the end of the deployment (9/5) 
probably due to fouling, data was retained. Also below normal DO values were 
recorded from 9/13 until the end of the month. As mentioned in the dissolved 
oxygen probe data qualifier, the reliability of DO data after the first 96 hours 
post-deployment may be inaccurate due to membrane fouling and should be 
considered suspect.

There were three slightly negative turbidity values. These were retained.

The following turbidity values were out of range and deleted.
9/20/02	5:00:00	161.5

October
Based on the depth and other data obtained during the 10/1 to 10/29 deployment, 
it was discovered that the instrument had been moved on 10/14. This sonde is not 
attached in a fixed position but rather, attached to a mooring. It appears that 
it was dragged from its position, possibly by a boat on 10/1 at 0730. This was 
apparent when the data was downloaded post-deployment on 10/29. The instrument 
was in a shallower location and it appears to have been out of the water at low 
tide. All data between 10/14 0730 and 10/29 1500 is therefore inaccurate and was 
deleted.

The following turbidity values were out of range and deleted.

10/13/02	14:30:00	287.9
10/30/02	20:30:00	177.7

Some dissolved oxygen data after 10/29 is higher than the normal expected range. 
Data over 140% should be considered suspect as the post-deployment DO value was 
126.6%.

November
No data 11/29 0330. The sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.

The following DO values were out of range and deleted.
Date		Time		DO% DO mg/L
11/04/2002	13:00:00	071.8	07.2
11/04/2002	13:30:00	062.1	06.3
11/04/2002	14:00:00	066.7	06.7

Any DO data prior to the 11/19 deployment should be considered suspect. Post-
deployment DO value was 126.6 % Possible reason, fouling of membrane.

Water temperature rises from 11/7 to 11/16. This is not usually seen in 
November, as typically there is a steady temperature drop. However during this 
time period a warm-up spell occurred with air temperatures as high as 70 degrees 
F. (20C). Data is correct.

All data was deleted for 11/18 16:30 to 11/19 1200, 11/19 1930 - 2100 and 11/23 
2100 to 11/25 0100. It was apparent from the salinity and depth data that the 
instrument had been moved during these periods and was periodically out of the 
water.

The following turbidity values were above normal range and deleted.

Lamprey River
April
No data 4/1 0000 to 4/19 1500. sonde not yet deployed.

There were 380 negative turbidity data points that fell below -0.4. The data was 
deleted. This turbidity probe was calibrated successfully before deployment; 
however, the post deployment turbidity reading 2 weeks later was 45.3. So 
possible probe malfunction was responsible for the excessive negative readings.

One turbidity point was beyond the upper range and was deleted.
4/25/02	3:00:00	164


May
No dissolved oxygen data 5/29 1500 to 5/30 0630. About an hour after deployment, 
the sonde recorded negative numbers for about 15 hours. It then recovered and 
began reporting correct data again. Possibly something stuck to the membrane for 
this period of time. Data was removed.

No turbidity data 5/1 0000 to 5/8 0930 All values were negative. This probe had 
a successful pre-deployment calibration, however its post-deployment turbidity 
reading in zero standard was 45.3. Apparently the probe malfunctioned. The data 
was deleted.

The following turbidity negative turbidity values were deleted. The 6136 
turbidity probe used during this deployment was the probe that subsequently 
proved to be faulty.

Between approximately 5/13 and 5/24 the pH values are unusually low. However 
there were close to 4 inches of rain during this period and the salinity values 
are near zero. Low pH is not unexpected during fresh water conditions, however 
numbers below 6 should be considered suspect. Data was retained.

June
No date 6/10 1000 to 1100. The instrument was brought into the lab to replace a 
cap onto the data port because the sonde had ceased communicating with the 1240 
radio. 

No dissolved oxygen data 6/18 2330 to 6/21 1230. The values were very high, 
beyond accepted range, probably due to end of deployment fouling of the 
membrane. Data was deleted.

No pH data 6/3 1100 to 6/8 1900. This sonde had good pre and post deployment pH 
calibrations. During the period in question, the pH values plunged to 
unacceptable levels, as low as pH 4. Normal readings resumed before the end of 
the deployment so this probably was not an equipment failure, but rather 
something obstructing the probe, which then broke free, so that the pH values 
returned to a normal range. Data was deleted.

There were 563 negative turbidity values <-0.4. Most of these occurred from 
6/21 to the end of the month during a deployment during which the defective 6136 
turbidity probe was employed. Data was deleted.

July
The dissolved oxygen data from approximately 7/16 1800 to 7/25 0800 is 
abnormally low. This is probably due to end of deployment fouling of the probe. 
Data is suspect but retained.

pH data 7/10 1400 to 7/25 1230 is out of range (too low). This was most likely 
due to equipment or probe failure. The pH probe passed pre-deployment 
calibration, but the post deployment value was 6.24 in standard 7.  The Lamprey 
River site does not communicate with our telemetry system so problems with data 
cannot be discovered until the data is downloaded. This pH data was deleted.

The following turbidity values were above normal range and deleted.

There were approximately 150 negative turbidity values <-0.4. These were 
deleted. It appeared that the wiper may have stuck over the optics from time to 
time.

August
Between 8/13 0300 and 8/23 1300 the salinity and specific conductivity data was 
extremely erratic and out of range. Probable cause probe malfunction or fouling. 
The probe had an acceptable post-deployment calibration. Data was deleted as 
well as the associated dissolved oxygen mg/l data.

Dissolved oxygen data was out of normal range from 8/1 1700 to 8/4 2300 and 8/27 
1230 to 1800, possibly due to fouling. Data was deleted.

Numerous %DO values for August exceed 130 or fall below 50. These are suspect 
but retained. 

pH values out of range 8/6 1130 to 8/23 1300. Post-deployment pH value in 
standard 7 was 6.04. Probe failure. Data deleted.

The following turbidity values were above normal range and deleted.

8/22/02	10:00:00	695

There were 148 negative turbidity values <-0.4. Most occurred during the 
deployment of the defective 6136 turbidity probe. Data was deleted.

September
No data 9/13 0030 to 9/30 2330. The instrument stopped recording on 9/13. 
Because this site is not included in our radio telemetry system, it was not 
discovered until the sonde was downloaded on 10/2 that it stopped recording on 
9/13. Upon inspection, no obvious reason was found, the batteries were fully 
charged and the internal memory had capacity for 288 days of logging. The 
instrument would run in the lab. This sonde was sent back to YSI and it was 
discovered that it had a bad seal on the cable connector, which allowed 
water to get into the pins on the bottom of the sonde connector.

Salinity, specific conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen data from 9/9 1500  to 
9/13 0000 are suspect because the sonde used for this deployment was 
subsequently found to be faulty after it was returned to YSI. Data was retained.

All turbidity data was deleted from this file because it was either negative or 
>3000NTU. Probe failure or malfunction.

October
No data 10/1 0000 to 10/2 0900 sonde failed to record for unknown reasons.

Salinity and specific conductivity data for approximately the first two weeks of 
October do not show the typical tidally influenced fluctuations because there 
was very little rain during this period so the salinity remained high. Data is 
correct.

From 10/2 0930 to approximately 10/11 1030 the dissolved oxygen values are 
uncharacteristically low possibly due to membrane fouling. Data is suspect but 
retained.

No turbidity data 10/2 0930 to 10/30 1000. There were almost 800 data points out 
of range (-3.1 to 1809). Because  the turbidity probe used (YSI 6136) was later 
found to have a defect, all data from  this deployment was removed.

The following turbidity values were <-0.4 and deleted.

November
Water temperature rises from 11/7 to 11/16. This is not usually seen in 
November, as typically there is a steady temperature drop. However during this 
time period a warm-up spell occurred with air temperatures as high as 70 degrees 
F. Data is correct.

During these periods, 11/18 1730 to 11/22 1300 and 11/23 2100 to 11/26 1700. pH, 
DO, salinity, specific conductivity, and temperature data were abnormal.  Data 
flat lined rather than fluctuating as would be expected. The post deployment 
calibrations were satisfactory so this was possibly a temporary instrument 
malfunction. Another possibility is that floating algae or debris was 
temporarily blocking the probes. Data was removed. Depth data during these 
periods was aberrant and also removed. This indicated that the instrument 
may have been moved.

The following turbidity data was out of range and deleted.

No data 12/3 1030 to 12/31 2330 Instrument was removed for the winter.

From 12/1 through 12/3, some pH values drop below normal range and should be 
considered suspect. However post-deployment calibration (7 in 7 standard) was 
satisfactory. Data was retained.

12. Missing Data:
All missing data is noted with a period (.). Data are missing due to equipment
