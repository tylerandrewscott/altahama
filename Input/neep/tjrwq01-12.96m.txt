2.  Entry Verification:
	The data are uploaded directly from the YSI model 6000upg dataloggers to 
the YSI PC6000 software into a file appended with the suffix .dat. The data are 
also downloaded directly from the datalogger into a spreadsheet importable file 
appended with the suffix .raw.  The data are then reviewed for major problems 
(i.e. logger out of water, probe malfunction, battery failure etc.) using the 
YSI PC6000 plotting software.  The resulting plot is printed out  and saved in a 
folder named "datalogger deployment log".  The .raw file is imported into Excel 
5.0 for Macintosh and is edited and formatted: Alternatively, if Hydrolab 
Recorder model dataloggers are used, the data are uploaded as a text file to the 
PC using Microsoft Windows 3.1 terminal program and imported into Excel 5.0 for 
further editing and formatting. 
	The tails of each sampling period are deleted and any suspect data is 
identified with the aid of Excel CDMO 5.0 macros and are evaluated and dealt 
with according to CDMO Operations Manual (ver.3.0) guidelines.  The parameter 
columns are checked for proper order and formatted to the correct decimal places 
using the "column reformat" macro supplied by the CDMO.  Missing data fields are 
inserted into the Excel spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Reasons for 
any missing or anomalous data are entered directly into the data file and the 
edited file is saved as a two-week excel file.  When an entire month of two-week 
edited data files have been collected, the files are combined into a 1 month 
excel file.   Any dates and times when data was not collected are inserted and 
the reason for the missing data (from the deployment log) are entered directly 
into the excel file along with the editing information from the two week files.  
All editing and missing data documentation are also recorded in an excel file 
named "missing data log".  The information in the "missing data log" is 
transferred to the metadata form. The edited and raw files are archived on a Sun 
Sparc 20 workstation and backed up to tape weekly.  Data and metadata files are 
uploaded via ftp to the CDMO. The person responsible for the data management is 
Michelle Cordrey. 

3.  Research Objectives:
	The Tijuana Estuarine Research Reserve is impacted heavily by both 
periodic raw sewage outflows and urban development. Only about a quarter of the 
reserve's 2,531 acres are tidally influenced with few channels deep enough for 
deployment of dataloggers.   Initially two stations were set up;  the 
"treatment" station was set up close to the mouth on the Southern end of the 
Oneonta Slough.  It was thought that this location would be best suited for 
monitoring changes caused by sewage outflow events.   The "control" station was 
set up on the northern end of Oneonta Slough.  Deployment at the treatment 
station, however, was continually halted by both shifting sediment and massive 
wracks of Kelp (macrocystis pyrifera) which would often bury the deployment set-
up on incoming tides.  After a number of different deployment equipment designs 
were implemented, with no success, logging at this site was terminated.  
Recently, however, a new channel was dredged in the northeast section of the 
estuary to increase tidal flushing.  This restoration site named the "Tidal 
Linkage" will be the new location of the "treatment" site.  Comparisons will be 
made with the natural site as the hydrology of the constructed treatment site 
changes over time.

4.  Research Methods (Dataloggers)
	A 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was strapped to a 6 ft length of steel fencing 
post and driven into the sediment until refusal prior to datalogger deployment 
in the center of the channel.  The bottom of the pipe is raised 1' off of the 
channel bottom and is capped. Multiple 1.5" holes have been drilled in the 
bottom  cap and sides to permit unrestricted flow to the sensors.  The 
datalogger units are then placed into and rest on the bottom of the tubes during 
deployment.  The sampling period is two weeks with measurements being taken 
every 30 minutes.  Measurements for specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved 
oxygen (percent saturation), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), temperature, turbidity and 
water level are recorded.  At the end of each two week period, the YSI data 
logger unit  is replaced by another YSI datalogger unit and brought back to the 
laboratory for downloading, cleaning and recalibration. These procedures are 
carried out according to the methods described in the YSI Operations Manual (see 
sections 3 and 7). Calibration standards for Specific Conductivity, pH and 
turbidity are purchased pre-made from VWR scientific.  The QA/QC procedures for 
the collected data are followed as given in the CDMO Operations Manual version 
3.0. 
	In May 1997 sampling at the "Tidal Linkage" station will begin and all 
deployment , calibration and QA/QC procedures will be followed exactly as they 
are at the Oneonta Slough station.

5.  Site location and character
General site Characteristics (TJE)
a) Tidal exchange (extremes): approx. -2 +7 MLLW,
b) Salinity: 4 ppt (extreme rain events) to 38 ppt
d) Latitude and longitude:  32 deg. 34 min. N, 117 deg. 07 min. W
c) Potential impacts: storm drain runoff from military airfield and adjacent 
residential areas, occasional sewage spills (10-15 MGD) into the Tijuana River 
from Mexico.  The area surrounding the estuary is heavily developed by 
residential housing as is the watershed which drains into the estuary.  
Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico.  The North Eastern section of 
the reserve is bordered by a military helicopter training base.  Vegetation in 
the area is dominated by common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) and Pacific 
cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).  

Specific Site characteristics: Oneonta Slough
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger is located on the upper portion of Oneonta 
Slough.  The channel runs North to South and is located on the northwestern 
edge of the reserve.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom directly below the datalogger is approx. 
0.55m below Mean Sea Level.
c) Channel width is approx. 20 meters.  Datalogger site is located 1km from 
mouth
d) Bottom type: sand and sediment
e) Area adjacent to west side of channel is developed. There is a 50 meter 
buffer of natural vegetation between development and the channel.  Area adjacent 
to east side of channel is relatively natural.
f) Direct impacts are estimated to be runoff from streets into channel during 
rain events.
g) Site location: 32? 34’ 4.8”N, 117? 07’ 52.3”W

Specific Site Characteristics: The Tidal Linkage
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger is located in the middle of the newly 
constructed channel.  The channel runs Northwest to Southwest and is located 
adjacent to the visitor's center in the northeastern section of the reserve.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom is approximately 0.9m below Mean Sea 
Level.
c) Channel width:  Approximately 5 meters. 
d) Bottom type: mostly sand in the area of the datalogger with a change to 
mostly mud at either end of the channel.
e) Site location: 32? 34’ 27.9”N, 117? 07’ 32.2”W

6.  Data Collection period
	Oneonta Slough data collection began July 1, 1995.  Multiple instrument 
problems (defective sensors,  software bugs, exploding batteries) and subsequent 
repairs and upgrades delayed data processing and compromised some of the data 
acquired between July 1995 and January 1, 1996.  These data are currently being 
evaluated and will be posted if found to be valid.  Sampling at the Tidal 
Linkage began in May 1997.  Sampling is ongoing.

7.  Associated researchers and projects
	A computer animated salinity model is being developed by Phil Williams 
Assoc. in collaboration with the Pacific Estuarine Research Laboratory (PERL) at 
San Diego State University (SDSU).  The datalogger data will be used to adjust 
and validate the model.  The salinity data and dilution model will be used to 
determine the distribution and dilution of human pathogens resulting form sewage 
spills into Tijuana Estuary.  The pathogen study is being conducted by Dr. Rick 
Gersberg, SDSU Grad. School of Public Health and PERL. The newly constructed 
channel is the site of research being conducted by PERL which focuses on methods 
for increasing the success of saltmarsh revegetation projects.

10.  Data anomalies (suspect data):

January 1996

a)  Specific Conductance (mS/cm) values were too low between 01/04(17:00) and 
01/19(15:00) and were deleted.  Improper maintenance suspected.

b) Salinity and DO(mg/l) were also deleted as values are calculated from 
Specific 
Conductance.

c)  Between 01/19(16:30) and  01/31(23:00) Depth values were transformed by 
subtracting 
.3048m (1 ft.) to adjust  for offset value that was entered on unit (deployment 
is such that 
offset value was not necessary) this continued until July when problem was 
corrected on 
unit.

February 1996

a)  02/01(00:00) - 02/02(14:30) Depth readings were transformed by subtracting 
.3048m (1 
ft.) to adjust for offset value that was entered on unit

b)  02/16(16:30) - 02/29(23:30) Depth readings were transformed by subtracting 
.3048m (1 
ft.) to adjust for offset value that was entered on unit

March 1996

a)  Between 03/01(13:55) and  03/15(14:25) time values were offset by -4 min. 8 
sec and were corrected.

b)  Between 03/01(13:55) and 03/15(14:25) depth values were deleted because they 
fell well 
below expected values. Reason could not be determined

c)  Between 03/15(15:05) and 03/30(13:35) time values were offset by. +5min 25 
sec and were corrected.  

d) Turbidity spikes:
03/15/96	15:05:25	0376
03/15/96	16:35:25	0146
03/17/96	09:05:25	0126

e) Many slightly negative turbidity values - calibration suspected.

April 1996

a) pH values were removed because of a larger than usual drift (approx. 1 pH 
unit).  Heavy 
biofouling was observed and is believed to be responsible for the large drift 
(see missing 
data)

b)  Between 04/06(07:30) and 04/22(12:00) dissolved oxygen (DO% and DOmg/l) were 
deleted as values fell below range of sensor (<0).

11.  Missing Data:

January 1996

01/01(00:00) - 01/04(16:30)		All parameters missing - units out for 
repair
01/04(17:00) - 01/19(15:00)		Sp. Cond, Salinity and DO (mg/l) missing -  
deleted 
because values for Sp. Cond. were too  low
01/04(17:00) - 01/31(23:30)		No turbidity - no probe
01/19(15:30 - 16:00)			All parameters missing - exchange of units
01/19(16:30) - 01/31(23:30)		pH missing - no probe installed

February 1996

02/01(00:00) - 02/02(14:30)		pH missing - no probe installed
02/01(00:00) - 02/29(23:30)		Turbidity missing - no probe

March 1996

03/01(00:00) - 03/15(14:25)		Turbidity  missing - Did not have probe
03/01(13:55) - 03/15(14:25) 		Depth values missing - they were deleted 
because 
values were too low
03/01(13:55) - 03/31(23:30)		pH values missing - were removed because of 
large 
drift (biofouling suspected)
03/30(14:00 - 15:30)			All parameters missing - exchange of units
03/30(16:00 - 23:30)			Turbidity missing - no probe

April 1996

04/01(00:00) - 04/11(14:30)		Turbidity missing - no probe installed
04/01(00:00) - 04/30(23:30)		pH values missing - removed because of large 
drift 
(biofouling suspected)

Between 04/06(07:30) and 04/22(12:00) dissolved oxygen (DO% and DOmg/l) were 
deleted as values fell below range of sensor (<0).
