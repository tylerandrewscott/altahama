2)Entry Verification Process:

The data are reviewed using the computer program PC6000 that
accompanies the YSI 6000 datalogger.  After the file is uploaded 
from the water quality instrument, PC6000 is used to plot the data and
perform basic statistical analysis (i.e., min., max., mean, std.
dev.). This information is printed out and attached to the Field
Log for the particular deployment. This printout is used during
file review to detect any gross outliers such as data taken when
the water quality instrument was removed from the water or those
caused by instrument failure. The data are imported into a
Microsoft Excel file that contains the current month's cumulative
recordings. When a complete month of data has been recorded the
file is ready for review. The data review includes several steps.
The first step is to format the data so that the parameter
columns are in the correct order and the data have the correct
number of decimal place holders. The CDMO 5.0 Excel macro is used
to check for any dates and times that data were not recorded due
to maintenance, battery failure, or other causes. Missing dates
and times are inserted into the file and a period is inserted
into the cells where data would normally be. An explanation for
the missing data is recorded onto the Water Quality Editing Log.
Next, the data are filtered using an Excel macro to find readings
outside the instrument measurement range and the "normal" range
for the site in question. Data outside the instrument range are
removed from the file and a period is inserted into the cell(s).
An explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto
the Water Quality Editing Log. Data outside the "normal" range of
water quality for a particular site were investigated for
validity based on weather data, field observations, QC checks,
PC6000 printouts, and instrument diagnostics. If the data are
rejected from the file a period is inserted into the cell(s) and
an explanation for the missing dates and times are recorded onto
the Water Quality Editing Log. The information recorded on the
Water Quality Editing Log is transferred to the metadata form.
The metadata form is then submitted with the data file to the
CDMO.  William Thompson, Research Technician, was responsible for
data management during 1998.  


3)Research Objectives:

Water quality instruments are deployed at the Masonboro Island
and Zeke's Island components of North Carolina's National
Estuarine Research Reserve and are anchored to the bottom of the
selected sites. Measurements are taken at 30 minute intervals for
approximately two week periods. These sites are relatively 
unimpacted by manmade perturbations and are considered long term 
monitoring locations.  



4)Research Methods:


The Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program began on 2 March
1992 at the Masonboro Island component, and 19 May 1994 at the
Zeke's Island component. The procedures described below were
instituted in June 1995 and thus do not cover data recorded
previously. At this time we are only performing long term water
quality monitoring and not a specific experiment.

Before each YSI 6000 is deployed, calibration and maintenance is
performed following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual 
addendum 7/94, sections 3,4, and 7).  Calibration standards are only
required for pH, turbidity and salinity; all other parameters are done as 
described in the manual.  Buffer solutions for 3 point pH calibration 
(pH 4,7 and 10) are purchased premade from a scientific supply house. The 
salinity standard is obtained from filtered seawater taken from Masonboro
Sound and analyzed at the Center for Marine Science Research (CMSR)in
Wilmington, NC using an osmometer. The dissolved oxygen membranes
are replaced before deployment and are allowed to sit at least 24
hrs prior to deployment. 

During deployment the weather conditions and tide stage are
recorded in the field observation log. Measurements of DO, pH,
salinity, specific conductance, and temperature are taken with
a calibrated YSI 6000 or other field instruments to check the 
accuracy of the instrumentation before deployment (as of October 
1995). The water quality instrument is placed inside a locked steel
cage, then anchored approximately 10cm off the bottom, and chained 
to a post at the monitoring site. Every 30 minutes during the sampling
period measurements are taken for temperature, specific conductance, 
salinity, dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen concentration,
depth, pH, and turbidity. 

At the end of the sample period the water quality instrument is
either brought back to the laboratory or serviced in the field.
If the water quality instrument is serviced in the field, the DO
sensor is either replaced with one that has a new membrane or the
old membrane is wiped with lens paper moistened with tap water to
remove biofouling. The weather and water quality measurements are
again noted in the field observation log. The calibration drift
and the effect of biofouling on the water quality instrument are
checked by comparing data readings in calibration standards or
against a recently calibrated YSI 6000. The water quality data are
then uploaded, and the instrument is cleaned and calibrated as 
noted previously. The water quality instrument is then ready for
deployment.  


5)Site Location and Character:

The four components of North Carolina's National Estuarine
Research Reserve (from north to south) are: Currituck Banks,
Rachel Carson, Masonboro Island and Zeke's Island. They are
located along the southeastern coast of the United States in the
Atlantic Ocean. Currently, only data from Masonboro and Zeke's
Island components are transferred to the CDMO. The two sites are: 

1. Research Creek, Masonboro Island
The Masonboro Island site is 0.72 km north east from the mouth of
Whiskey Creek, and east of the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), in a
small navigable channel called Research Creek at 34 deg 09'21.7"
latitude and 77 deg 50'59.9" longitude (GPS position). The site
has a salinity range of 18-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages
1.2 meters.

2. East Cribbing, Zeke's Island
The Zeke's Island site is located 1.8 km south of Federal
Point boat launch in a tidal basin estuary at 33 deg 56'23.5"
latitude and 77 deg 56'28.1" longitude (GPS position). This site
receives minimal freshwater input from leakage of the Cape Fear
River through the 5.6 km rock jetty that separate the two bodies
of water. Thus, the ocean tidal input through New Inlet is a
major factor in maintaining the high salinity; however, during
rainy periods major drops in salinity may occur. The site has a
salinity range of 15-35 ppt and a tidal range that averages 2
meters.


6)Data Collection Period

Research Creek data collection began on 2 March 1992, while
East Cribbing data collection commenced on 19 May 1994. All
monitoring is considered long term.

*The RC site was formerly designated as Masonboro Island (MS) and EC was formerly designated as Zeke’s Island (ZI).  Name changes were made on 1/11/2011 to be consistent with later station designations made necessary by the addition of an additional station in each component, and to clearly indicate that the station location throughout the North Carolina Reserve’s historical data set.  Raw file names were not changed. Please contact the Reserve directly or the NERRS Centralized Data Management Office for more information on this update.


10) Data anomalies (suspect data):

This section list data that are extreme for the aquatic system being monitored 
or are outside the measurement range of the instrument. The cause of such 
anomalies maybe a bad calibration, boat traffic disturbances, or a malfunction 
of the instrument.

11) Missing data:

This section lists any missing data within the corresponding data files. 
Missing data maybe caused by many reasons including maintenance periods, power 
loss, and data that have been removed because of instrument malfunction. 
Approximately every 2-3 weeks, there is a period of between 1 to 24 hrs 
(occasionally longer) of missing data due to maintenance and calibration. 
During the maintenance period all parameters will be missing.

A record and explanation of missing data that are not related to routine 
maintenance is kept in the Field Log for the particular deployment. All 
parameters recorded when the water quality instrument is exposed to air during 
a sample, either by an extremely low tide or physical displacement from its 
original location, are removed. Special note should be made regarding missing 
dissolved oxygen (DO) saturation (%), DO concentration (mg/l), specific 
conductance, salinity, and temperature measurements. If the DO saturation (%) 
data are removed, due to sensor malfunction or other circumstances, the DO 
concentration (mg/l) will also be missing. The DO concentration (mg/l) is 
calculated from DO saturation (%) and temperature data. This is also true for 
specific conductance and salinity data. Salinity (ppt) is determined by the YSI 
6000 using specific conductance and temperature data. If the temperature sensor 
malfunctions and the corresponding data are removed, all parameters requiring 
these data (DO saturation, DO concentration, specific conductance, salinity, 
and pH) for calculation or temperature compensation will also be removed.
