2.	Entry verification
	The data are downloaded from the YSI 6000s or 6600s to an IBM compatible 
PC.  Graphs of all data are printed using Ecowatch software and are examined for 
suspect, anomalous, or outlying data.  Files are converted to Macintosh Excel 
files and edited for transfer to the NERRS CDMO.  Files are merged to contain 
one full month of data.  Missing data (from maintenance and downloading down 
time) are inserted into the spreadsheet and are denoted by a period (.).  
Suspect data are deleted and replaced by periods (.).  After formatting the 
data, some files are more closely checked for anomalies in DeltaGraph Pro(r).  
Edited and raw files are archived on a Macintosh hard drive at Padilla Bay NERR.   
No CDMO Excel 5.0 macros were used.  Robin Cottrell completed this process of 
entry verification for the 2000 data.  Robin Cottrell and Douglas Bulthuis 
completed final verification and this metadata documentation.

3.	Research Objectives
	The Bay View Channel site has been set out to detect and monitor short-
term variability and long-term changes in Padilla Bay.  The Joe Leary Slough 
site has been set at the mouth of the slough to measure the effects of tidal 
"closure" of the tide gates on water in the slough and to detect long-term 
changes in water quality in the slough associated with implementation of a non 
point source pollution watershed action plan.  Measurements are taken every 30 
minutes at both sites unless otherwise noted in data anomalies.

4.	Research methods
	A YSI 6000 or 6600 were deployed in Joe Leary Slough in a vertical 
position, 0.25 m above the bottom of the slough (from 1 January to 11 October 
and at a depth of 1.7 m from December 20-13), in a 4 in. diameter PVC pipe which 
has holes and slits drilled in it to allow water circulation around the probes.  
The PVC pipe is attached to a steel pipe that was driven into the sediment.

	During September to December 2000, the lower part of Joe Leary Slough was 
dredged, including the area where the datasonde was deployed.  In order to 
prevent damage to the datasonde, the deployment apparatus was removed and no 
data collected from October 12 to December 19.  After the dredging was completed 
the area was examined.  The dredging had changed the configuration of the 
channel so that there was very little flow of water over the spot that the 
datasonde had been deployed for the last 5 years.  Therefore the deployment site 
was moved about 6 m away so that the deployment would, once again, be near the 
center of the flow toward the tide gate tubes.  Because the bottom was dredged 
out, the area of deployment is now much deeper than it had been.  In order to 
keep the data comparable with the previous 5 years of data collection, the YSI 
was deployed at the same height relative to Mean sea Level.  However, because 
the bottom was dredged out under this area, the new depth of the datasonde is 
1.7 m above the bottom from December 20 - 31, 2000.

	Some dissolved oxygen data from Joe Leary Slough were anomalous and could 
be explained if there were poor exchange between the water inside the deployment 
tube and water outside the deployment tube.  Therefore during four days in 
October 1998 and 10 days in December 1998, YSI datasondes were deployed inside 
and outside the deployment tube simultaneously at the same depth.  All data were 
very similar inside and outside the deployment tube (or fluctuated in parallel 
indicating differences in calibration) during October and December with the 
exception of the dissolved oxygen data during October.  During four tidal cycles 
in October 1998, the dissolved oxygen concentration inside the deployment tube 
did not increase with increasing salinity as much as dissolved oxygen in the 
water outside the deployment tube.  (In Joe Leary Slough, salinity values 
typically fluctuate from 0 to 10, 20 or even 30 PSU with each tidal cycle, with 
higher oxygen concentrations usually observed in the high salinity water.)  The 
October dissolved oxygen data could indicate that organic material with a high 
oxygen demand may have accumulated inside the deployment tube and/or epiphytic 
and bacterial growth along the openings in the deployment tube may be exerting a 
high oxygen demand on the water in the tube.  If exchange between the water 
inside and outside the pipe were slow enough, the material and organisms inside 
the tube could exert a measurable decrease in dissolved oxygen.  When the same 
experiment was repeated in December 1998, there was no difference in dissolved 
oxygen inside and outside the deployment tube.  Therefore, dissolved oxygen data 
from Joe Leary Slough need to be interpreted with caution because there may be 
times when the data indicate dissolved oxygen concentrations inside the 
deployment tube that are different than concentrations in Joe Leary Slough 
outside the deployment tube. In order to reduce the possibility of such 
differences occurring, the deployment pipe was replaced so that during 2000, the 
cutout portion of the deployment pipe around the sonde guard was increased and 
only two one-inch wide strips of deployment pipe remained around the sensor 
guard.  This relatively unrestricted flow should reduce the possibility of such 
differences in dissolved oxygen inside and outside the pipe during 2000.

	A YSI 6000 or 6600 were deployed in Padilla Bay in a tributary of Bayview 
Channel.  They were deployed using the same design as that in Joe Leary Slough, 
except that the PVC pipe was attached to two steel pipes.   The depth of the YSI 
was -1.1 m (depth below MLLW) and about 0.75 m above the bottom along the 
sloping edge of a small channel draining the surrounding intertidal flats. 

	In all cases, measurements of temperature, specific conductivity, 
salinity, percent saturation of dissolved oxygen, depth and pH are recorded 
every half hour.  At the end of each sampling period, the YSI 6000 or 6600 is 
brought back into the laboratory for downloading, cleaning, and recalibration.   

	All calibrations are conducted according to the protocols in the YSI 6000 
Operation and Service Manual.  For the conductivity calibration, a conductivity 
standard of 50 mS/cm was used.  The pH calibration is a 2 point calibration 
using standard pH buffer solutions with a pH of 7 and 10.  The KCl solution and 
Teflon membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe are changed prior to each YSI 6000 
or 6600 deployment and the new oxygen membrane is allowed to soak overnight in 
water saturated air before calibration.
	
5.	Site location and character
	General:  Padilla Bay (48° 30' N; 122° 30' W) is a shallow embayment in 
northern Puget Sound.  The tide flats are dominated by the eelgrass Zostera 
marina, which covers approximately 3,000 ha.  Zostera japonica, a recent invader 
to the region, now covers about 350 ha of the bay.  Tides are mixed semi-diurnal 
with a mean range of 1.55 m.  Salinity varies from about 15 to 30 PSU.

	Padilla Bay is an "orphaned" estuary in that the Skagit River no longer 
empties directly into it.  Most of the land in the 9300 ha Padilla Bay watershed 
is agricultural, and is drained by four sloughs which empty into the bay.  The 
salinity in Padilla Bay reflects both the sloughs that flow into the bay and the 
greater Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary in which Padilla Bay is located.  
Major freshwater flows into this area of the Puget Sound-Georgia Basin estuary 
come from the Fraser and Nooksack Rivers to the north and from the Skagit 
River to the south.

	Joe Leary Slough Site  (48° 31' 05.3" N; 122° 28' 22.8" W) Joe Leary 
Slough drains land that is predominantly annual crop agriculture and pasture 
land with some low-density housing.  The slough is characterized by high fecal 
and nutrient inputs, high turbidity, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  
During the summer, there is low flow and the depth ranges from 0.5-1.5 m.  
During winter flooding, the slough can reach a depth of 4 m.   There is a dam at 
the mouth of the slough with twelve 4 ft. diameter outfall pipes that have one-
way hinged tide gates.   Upstream water flows out of Joe Leary Slough when water 
height in Padilla Bay is lower than water height in Joe Leary Slough (i.e. 
ebbing tide and low water).  Some saline water from Padilla Bay seeps through 
the tide gates during high water.  The bottom of the slough is composed of very 
soft sediment, which is periodically dredged.  A YSI 6000 (or 6600) is deployed 
on the freshwater side of the tide gates.  The depth of the datasonde was about 
0.25 m above the bottom for the last five years and from January 1 through 
October 11, 2000.  The depth was changed to 1.7 m above the bottom from December 
20 -31, 2000 (see Research Methods above).  The latitude/longitude were measured 
with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and differentially corrected with post processing 
providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 5m.

	Bayview Channel Site  (48° 29' 46.6" N; 122° 30' 01.8" W) Bayview Channel, 
a major Padilla Bay tributary/distributary, floods and drains intertidal flats 
including eelgrass beds, mats of macroalgae, and flats without macro-vegetation.  
The YSI 6000 (or 6600) is located in a tributary channel to Bayview Channel.  
The tributary drains predominately eelgrass (Zostera marina and Z. Japonica) 
covered intertidal flats.  Bottom sediments beneath the YSI 6000 are fine silt 
and clay overlying sand.   The YSI 6000 is deployed in a black PVC pipe that is 
attached to two steel pipes set in the sediment.  When deployed, the datasonde 
is located about 0.75 m above the bottom Pollutants entering the bay include 
general non-point source, agricultural non-point source, and fecal coliform 
bacteria from agriculture, failing septic tanks and wildlife.  The 
latitude/longitude were measured with a Trimble GeoExplorer II and ifferentially 
corrected with post processing providing a manufacturer's stated accuracy of ± 
5m.

6.	Data collection period
	Data collection was continuous from January 1 to December 31 at the Bay 
View Channel site and from January 1 to October 11 and from December 11 to 31 at 
the Joe Leary Site except for times of downloading, cleaning and recalibration 
as noted in the missing data section.  No data collection was attempted in Joe 
Leary Slough from October 12 to December 19 because of dredging of the slough in 
the area where the sonde is deployed (see Research Methods, above).
	 
	Deployment and retrieval times at the Joe Leary Slough site and the Bay 
View Channel site are listed below.  The times indicate the first and last 
measurements made with each deployment.

Data columns are separated by tabs.  Each file contains a two line
column header at the top of the page which identifies measurements and 
units for each column.

*During 1997 records were kept of the atmospheric pressure during calibration of 
depth and the apparent depth after each two to four week deployment.  The data 
indicated that depth readings could read as much as 0.28 m above or below true 
depth.  Therefore, although the sensor may accurately read ± 0.001 m, changes in 
atmospheric pressure when deployed indicate depth may be ± 0.3 m.

11.	Data anomalies

January 
JL:  
No data for all parameters until 6 Jan at 1630 because the batteries failed 
during deployment. 
Dissolved oxygen data from 0400 on 23 Jan through the end of the month were low; 
cause is unknown but may be related to debris found in the sonde guard. There 
was also evidence of beaver activity at this site. Data were retained. 
	
BY:  
There was no pH probe installed during January. 
The DO membrane was damaged after 2330 on 17 Jan, as indicated by an abrupt drop 
in the readings eventually falling to negative values, so all DO data after that 
date have been deleted. During the following periods turbidity readings were 
high and erratic so the data were deleted.

February 

JL:  
Dissolved oxygen data from 1 Feb at 0000 through 1500 were low; cause is 
unknown but may be related to debris found in the sensor guard. There was 
evidence of beaver activity at this site. Data were retained.
There are no data for all parameters on 29 Feb at 1630 due to a 40 second delay 
in the new 6600 software when logging samples. The last sample was cut off when 
downloading because 16:30 was specified instead of 16:30:40.

BY:  
There are no pH data from 0000 on 1 Feb through 1330 on 3 Feb because there was 
no pH probe.  
Dissolved oxygen data from 1 Feb, 0000 to 3 Feb, 1330 and 21 Feb, 1800 to 29 
Feb, 2330 has been deleted due to damaged DO membranes. 
Erratic high turbidity values on 9 Feb at 0900 and 1230 and 29 Feb at 1030 
were removed.

April 

JL:  
Dissolved oxygen data from 12 April, 2100 through 2200 have been deleted due to 
negative values. 
Dissolved oxygen data from 13 April, 2300 to 19 April, 1330 have been deleted 
due to anomalously low readings (including negative numbers) at the end of 
logger deployment. 
Turbidity data on 7 April at 1000 and from 12 April, 0630 to 19 April, 1330 has 
been deleted due to high and erratic readings, the latter probably due to debris 
inside the sensor guard.

BY: 
There are no data for all parameters on 11 April at 0930 due to a 40 second 
delay in the 6600 software when logging samples. The last sample was cut off 
when downloading because 09:30 was specified instead of 09:30:40.

May 

JL:  
There are no data for all parameters on 4 May at 1000 due to a 40 second delay 
in the 6600 software when logging samples. The last sample was cut off when 
downloading because 10:00 was specified instead of 10:00:40. 
On 16 May at 2200 there was dip in values for temp, pH, salinity and D.O. and a 
small peak in turbidity, cause unknown. Data were retained. 
During the following periods turbidity values were high and erratic so the data 
were deleted, this was probably due to debris caught in the sensor guard:

DO oxygen dips down to 22.1% and 2.3 mg/L on 05/17/00 13:30:00. Cause unknown. 
Data were retained. 

BY: 	Salinity values took an unusual dip beginning at 1230 on 25 May and 
continuing low until 530 on 26 May, cause unknown. Data retained. 
During the following periods turbidity values were high and erratic so the data 
were deleted, cause unknown:

June 

JL:  
There is no data for all parameters on 6 June at 1230 and 20 June at 1430 due to 
a 40 second delay in the 6600 software when logging samples. The last 
sample was cut off when downloaded because 12:30 (or 14:30) was the time 
specified instead of 12:30:40 (or 14:30:40). 
Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from 20 June at 1500 through the end of the 
month because the D.O. membrane was damaged soon after deployment. 
During the following periods turbidity values were high and erratic so the data 
were deleted:

06/01/00	8:00:00, 8:30:00, 17:30:00
06/02/00	4:00:00
06/05/00	19:00:00

06/13/00	1:00:00
06/24/00	4:30:00

BY: 	
Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from 29 June at 1630 to 2330 on 30 June 
because of an abrupt drop to negative values. Damage to the D.O. membrane is 
suspected but was not apparent at retrieval or during the calibration check. 
Turbidity values that were high and erratic were deleted for 4 June at 1200, 7 
June at 1500, and 19 June at 1030.

July 

JL:    
Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from 1 July at 0000 through 5 July at 1230 
because the D.O. membrane was damaged. 
There are no data for all parameters on 5 July at 1300 due to a 40 second delay 
in the 6600 software when logging samples. The last sample was cut off when 
downloaded because 13:00 was the time specified instead of 13:00:40. 
There were no data for all parameters at 1330 on 5 July because of exchange of 
datasondes. 
During the following periods turbidity values were high and erratic so the data 
were deleted, this was probably due to debris in the sensor guard:

07/04/00	23:00:00
07/15/00	19:30:00
07/16/00	7:00:00, 7:30:00	
07/17/00	1:30:00. 13:30:00, 15:00:00, 20:30:00, 22:00:00	
07/18/00	9:30:00
07/19/00	0:00:00, 3:30:00, 5:30:00, 6:00:00, 7:00:00, 8:30:00,9:00:00

BY: 
All dissolved oxygen data were deleted because of suspected damage to the 
D.O. membrane. Damage was not evident visually or at calibration check but 
readings were abnormally low for this site during July and early in this 
deployment negative values were recorded (see June notes). 
Turbidity values that were high and erratic were deleted for July dates and 
times as follows: 7 July at 630; 13 July at 330; 23 July at 800 and 1030; 29 
July at 2130; 30 July at 0530. 

August 

JL:   
One high (over 1000 NTU) turbidity value at 1230 on 22 August was deleted. 
Dissolved oxygen should be interpreted with caution from 1500 on 22 August 
through the end of the month, because later in this deployment (in September) 
there was obvious damage to the D.O. membrane. 

BY:   
Dissolved oxygen data were deleted from 1 August at 0000 to 18 August at 
0600 because of suspected damage to the D.O. membrane. (See July notes). 
Turbidity values that were high and erratic were deleted for August dates and 
times as follows: 4 August at 1230; 5 August at 1900; 6 August at 1700 and 
2000; 19 August at 0100 and 1730; 29 August at 0430 and 2100.

September 

JL:    
Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from 2 September at 0430 through 11 
September at 1000 due to a damaged D.O. membrane. 
There are no data for all parameters on 11 September at 1030 due to a 40 second 
delay in the 6600 software when logging samples. The last sample was cut off 
when downloaded because 10:30 was the time specified instead of 10:30:40.  
Turbidity values that were high and erratic were deleted for 14 September at 
0600 and 16 September at 1600. 
One salinity value on 12 September at 0700 was deleted because it was erratic 
and high, cause unknown. 
Dredging in Joe Leary slough was first noticed on Monday, 25 September but may 
have been started earlier on the weekend. Dredging began at the Bay View - 
Edison Road bridge and progressed westward toward the tide gates where the 
datasonde was deployed.  Turbidity peaks began to increase during the low tides 
of 23 September. All data from this point on should be interpreted with caution 
due to the dredging that went on for many weeks.  
During the following periods depth values were negative (largest was -0.09m) so 
they were deleted. There was no evidence that the probes had been exposed to the 
air:

09/20/00	6:00:00, 6:30:00
09/21/00	5:30:00 - 8:30:00	
09/22/00	7:00:00 - 9:00:00
09/23/00	8:00:00 - 10:00:00
09/24/00	9:00:00 - 11:00:00
09/26/00	12:00:00

BY:   
Salinity values took an unusual dip beginning at 1800 on 26 September and 
remained low until 0500 on 27 September, cause unknown. Data were retained. 
Dissolved oxygen data were deleted from 7 September at 1500 through the end of 
the month because of damage to the D.O. membrane. 
During the following periods turbidity values were high and erratic so the data

October 

JL:   
Joe Leary slough was being dredged during this abbreviated deployment and all 
parameters reflect this altered environment. The sonde was pulled from this 
site on 11 October at 1400 to keep it from being damaged. 
No data for all parameters from that time until the site was reinstalled in 
December.

BY:   
Dissolved oxygen data from 1 October, 0000 to 11 October at 1500 has been 
deleted due to damage to the DO membrane. 
Turbidity values that were high and erratic were deleted for October dates and 
times as follows: 7 October at 2000; 27 October at 0230.

November 

JL:   
No data for all parameters. There was no datalogger deployed because the 
channel was being dredged.

BY:   
No data anomalies.

December 

JL:    
The Joe Leary slough deployment site was relocated after the slough was dredged. 
At the new site the sonde is positioned about 1.7 meters above the bottom of the 
slough to keep it at approximately the same level, in relationship to the tide 
gates, as it was before dredging.  During this deployment the sonde was about 
0.15 m above the planned depth of 1.7 m because the security chain was too 
short. The data from Joe Leary Slough beginning in December 2000 reflects this 
change in the depth configuration at the deployment site.  In particular, high 
salinity water seeped through the tide gates each tidal cycle (see Section 5 
above) and filled the bottom of the slough up to the height of the datasonde 
from January thorough October 2000. Starting in December, this water flowed into 
the deeper portions of the slough that had been dredged.  Thus, from December 
2000, the salinity at the datasonde is lower than the rest of the year because 
the high salinity water remained in the newly formed deeper parts of the slough 
and did not mix into the water layers where the sonde was located. Deployment 
began 12/20 1530 due to dredging.

BY:   
The data for dissolved oxygen and salinity from 1600 on 24 December through the 
end of the month were deleted. The D.O. membrane was damaged (probably by the 
crustacean found living in the sensor guard) and something had packed debris 
into the salinity probe orifice, perhaps living there, causing erratically low 
readings. 
Salinity data from 14 December at 1000 up to deleted data should be interpreted 
with caution even though it looks reasonable.  
Turbidity values that were high and erratic, probably due to debris or animals 
in the sensor guard, were deleted for December dates and times as follows: 2 
December at 1900; 13 December at 0500; 22 December at 0030.


12.	Missing data
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration (both pre and post) problems. For more details on deleted data, see 
the Anomalous Data Section (11). To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.
