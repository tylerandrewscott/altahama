2).  Entry verification:

A. Data Input Procedures
	
	The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data 
were downloaded from each instrument on the weather station to a 
Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger. The CDMO Data Logger Program was 
loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule). The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W 
software supplied by Campbell Scientific. This software was located on 
a computer to which the data was uploaded (every 15 minutes) via a 
short haul modem to a computer located at the Coastal Ecology Center.  
The data was saved as a raw data file (LF_RAW.dat) onto a separate hard 
drive and backed up.
	Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather 
Data Management Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an 
Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic to 
interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and 
Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, 
it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access 
Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of 
error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces 
error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are 
noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were 
performed are noted in the Data Correction section below.  
	Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind 
speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 
C in a 15 minute period, and relative humidity change of greater than 
25% in a 15 minute period.  All errors of these types were double 
checked with other data that could support such "anomalous" weather 
changes and noted in the sections that follow. Both raw data files and 
Access databases were saved to the DCP server with daily tape back-up. 
	Jim Dochtermann error checked and compiled the 2001 weather 
data.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data 
collected with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was 
distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the 
old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums 
every fifteen minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day 
(array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 
and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   the hourly 
101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, 
the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing 
data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP 
weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed 
and left blank.

3) Research Objectives
	The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological 
data for Wells, in order to supplement SWMP water quality YSI data and 
research data, and to observe any environmental changes or trends over 
time. 


4) Research Methods

	The Campbell Scientific weather station (CR10X datalogger) is 
programmed to measure parameters every 5 seconds to produce both hourly 
and daily averages of measurements, including air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, LiCor (solar radiation), rainfall, wind 
speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 
minutes and that data is stored in array 150. Data are downloaded to a 
desktop computer from the datalogger via the SC32A interface.  On-site 
weather conditions are measured to verify the accuracy of the readings 
by the sensors.  Sensors on the weather station are inspected for 
damage or debris periodically. Sensors are sent back to Campbell 
Scientific for calibration at a minimum of every two years. 
	The data is analyzed using the Weather Data Management Program 
where a database and error report is create for each month from the raw 
data files. The error reports are used to assist in the QA/QC of the 
data. Data is then edited in Access and recompiled in the WDMP. All 
edits and errors are documented in the metadata. 


5) Site location and character    

	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York 
County, within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and 
faces the Atlantic Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 
miles) south of Portland, Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, 
Massachusetts.  The Reserve encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of 
Maine coastline of tidally flushed wetlands, riparian and transitional 
upland fields and forests within the Little River Estuary and the 
larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in the sandy 
glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers empty 
into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles 
along the Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river's inlet are double spit 
barrier beaches attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system is 
approximately 5 sq. km and is composed of large intertidal marshes 
(predominantly S. patens and S. alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud 
flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed for the Webhannet River 
estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 streams, 
brooks or creeks, which enter the estuary.  These tributaries flow 
across sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the impermeable 
sandy mud of the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The 
Webhannet River is connected to the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a 
spring tidal prism of 28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). The force and 
volume of tidal action affect the salinity level of both rivers.  In 
the Wells region, the annual mean wave height is almost 20 inches.  The 
estuarine system is dominated by semi-diurnal tides having a range of 
8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into both estuaries 
is moderate to low (on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), 
especially in the summer, because of the rivers' relatively small 
drainage areas and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The 
relatively low flows from these two rivers taken in with the 20 inch 
per year average runoff of the area surrounding the estuaries combine 
to form a freshwater flow that is dwarfed by tidal flushing.  Twelve-
foot tides dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet estuary, which 
has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet estuary, fed 
by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and 
greatly developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for 
comparison with the relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land 
use of the Webhannet estuary include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh 
water, and tidal marsh; a total of 63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 
18.6% for developed land (compared to a total of 5.7% development in 
the Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 1997).
	The weather station is located (43 deg 20.244 Latitude, 70 deg 
33.000 Longitude) on a 32' telephone pole surrounded by mowed grass.  
The temperature and humidity probes are located on the north side of 
the pole at a height of 10'. To the NW of the pole is the Coastal 
Ecology Center, a 20' high, 111' long building, at a distance of 37', 
running NE/SW.  Further to the NW (153' from the pole) is the library, 
in a 25' high wing of the barn.  The barn itself is 223' from the 
station and runs NE/SW.  It is 38' high and is the largest obstruction 
in the area.  The rain gauge is located 9' southeast of the weather 
station pole and is situated on a post with the top of the funnel is 
10' from the ground. 
	There are two SWMP water quality sampling sites in the Webhannet 
River estuary.  These are located at the Head of Tide and at the Inlet.  
The tidal range at each of these sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.   
	The Head of Tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells 
Reserve, just downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 
feet east of Route One (43 deg 17' 54.25227" Latitude, 70 deg 35' 
13.82728" Longitude).  Route One is used heavily with traffic all year, 
especially during the summer tourist months. This site has soft mud, 
sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide depth is 
relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean 
of 3.6 ppt.  These head waters of the Webhannet are relatively 
undeveloped. This site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One 
bridge, and is our roving site.
	The Inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, 
at the Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19' 12.44804" Latitude, 70 deg 33' 
13.82728" Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an 
extensive wetland/salt marsh area which is surrounded by development.  
Wells Harbor, which was most recently dredged in 1971, has moorings for 
approximately 200 commercial fishing and recreational boats.  The mouth 
of the river flows between two jetties to the Atlantic Ocean.  This 
channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a predominately sand 
substrate and is characterized by strong current during incoming and 
outgoing tides.  The maximum depth of the Inlet site is 3 meters. The 
salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean of 31 ppt.  The Inlet site 
is heavily impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term 
monitoring site.

8). Associated researchers and projects

WELLS NATIONAL ESTUARINE RESEARCH RESERVE RESEARCH AT THE RESERVE for 
2000-2001:

The Research Program at the Wells NERR conducts and supports research, 
monitoring, workshops, and research/resource management planning of 
relevance at local, regional and national levels.  The overall aim of 
our work is to produce science-based information needed to sustain or 
restore Gulf of Maine coastal habitats and resources, especially those 
found in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds.  During 2000-2001 twenty-
three different studies (involving 79 scientists, students, and staff  
from the Reserve, 26 academic institutions and 19 resource management 
groups) focused on several related themes: 1) the quality of water 
resources  in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds 2) land conservation 
strategies to protect coastal watersheds 3) factors controlling salt 
marsh accretion, erosion and plant community vigor 4) the value of salt 
marsh as habitat for fish, shellfish and birds,  and 5) restoration of 
salt marsh habitat degraded through human actions.

Estuarine Water Resource Quality

Water quality is monitored continuously at several stations with 
automated instruments as part of a NERRS systemwide monitoring program, 
as well as bimonthly at 15-20 stations through our WET volunteer 
monitoring program.  The WET program also monitors two important 
biological parameters: fecal coliform bacterial contamination (an 
indicator of human health risk) and phytoplankton productivity (an 
indicator of estuarine health).  These data have 1) allowed us 
to identify several bacterial "hot spots" that we will be working to 
eliminate, 2) are used to identify and open areas safe for 
shellfishing, and 3) have uncovered a relation between tides and low 
dissolved oxygen (a stressful condition for marine life) that needs 
further study.  Our water quality work has contributed to the 
designation of several Priority Watersheds in coastal Southern Maine by 
the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 

Coastal Conservation Strategies

The Coastal Mosaic Project is a new program developed in response to 
requests for support from the conservation community to increase the 
quantity, quality and ecological integrity of conserved lands in our 
region.  Research staff organize and facilitate meetings, workshops, 
and communications for 18 partner conservation groups.  A key element 
of the Project is the Conservation Resource Center, a Reserve staffed 
GIS facility with a growing database able to provide maps of property, 
natural features and other data needed to develop effective 
conservation goals and strategies.  The Project is nearing completion 
of conservation lands maps for 13 Southern Maine coastal towns, and is 
undertaking an initiative to develop coastal watershed conservation 
strategies for 12 coastal watersheds within these towns.  The Reserve 
has a particular interest in educating communities about the ecologic 
and economic benefits of land conservation, especially along estuarine 
and riverine shorelines.

Salt Marsh Habitats and Communities

Factors that control the dynamics and vigor of salt marsh plant 
communities and marsh peat formation consequently determine the ability 
of a salt marsh to persist in the face of sea level rise.  Through a 
combination of experimental manipulations and long term monitoring, a 
number of multi-year studies are currently producing data to answer 
questions concerning the sustainability of salt marsh habitats in this 
region.  These studies are looking at nutrient-plant relations, plant 
community responses to physical and hydrologic disturbance, and the 
relative contribution of short-term natural events (e.g. storms) and 
human activities (dredging, tidal restriction) on patterns of sediment 
accretion and erosion.  The Reserve's marshes and beaches are already 
among the best studied sites in the U.S. with regard to long term 
accretion and erosion (over thousands of years).

Habitat value for fish, shellfish and birds

The Reserve combines long-term monitoring with periodic surveys and 
short-term experiments to identify species and measure trends and 
changes in populations of fish, crustaceans, clams and birds.   We have 
10 years of data on upland and shore birds with which to assess the 
status of resident and migratory avian populations, and 8 years of 
wading bird data that we use as a gross level indicator of salt marsh 
health, which appears to be stable.  Our periodic larval, juvenile and 
adult fish surveys have produced the best available data for fish 
utilization of salt marsh estuaries in the Gulf of Maine. In the 
coming year we plan to develop a long-term monitoring program for 
finfish that will be coordinated with other sites within the Gulf of 
Maine and along the east coast.  Since 1994 we have been conducting 
surveys and field experiments to look at the survival and growth of 
hatchery seed, juvenile and adult softshell clam with regard to habitat 
characteristics and predation by the invasive green crab.

Salt Marsh Degradation and Restoration

 Salt marsh ecosystems in the Gulf of Maine have sustained themselves 
in the face of sea-level rise and other natural disturbances for nearly 
five thousand years.  Since colonial times large areas of salt marsh 
(up to half of the total area) have been lost through diking, draining 
and filling.  Today, the remaining marshland is fairly well protected 
from outright destruction, but during the past 100 years, and 
especially since the 1950's, salt marshes have been divided into 
fragments by roads, causeways, culverts and tide gates.  Most of these 
fragments have severly restricted tidal flow, leading to chronic 
habitat degradation and greatly reduced access for fish and other 
marine species.  Since 1991, the Wells Reserve has been studying the 
impact of these restrictions on salt marsh functions and values, and 
the response of salt marshes to tidal restoration.  We have been 
working to promote an awareness of the damage being done and the 
benefits of salt marsh restoration throughout the Gulf of Maine.

Research Program Update:
In addition to the Reserve-sponsored projects outlined above, numerous 
visiting investigators will be involved in on-site research.  Topics 
include: the effects of land use, sea level, and climate on estuarine 
productivity; the relationship between soil nutrients and plant 
community patterns; the influence of soil salinity on plant community 
interactions; the effect of tidal restriction on marsh peat accretion; 
the comparative ecology of fringe marshes and back barrier marshes; 
habitat use by upland birds, and the ecology of lyme disease.

 The Wells NERR Research Dept. completed the work on the following 
project:  
"Community-based plan to manage current and future threats from point 
and non-source point pollution in the Merriland River and Branch Brook 
Watersheds of the Little River Estuary".  There was a shoreline survey 
of the Little River and its Watershed this past March.  The goal of 
this project was a)to produce a community-based watershed management 
plan for the Branch Brook, Merriland River, Little River combined 
watersheds, and b)to convey the elements of the plan to critical 
audiences through a succinct "road show", culminating in a public event 
to showcase the plan.  The project results are currently being written 
up.

 The Wells NERR Research Dept. also completed the work on the 
following project: 
"Measuring the Health of the York River Ecosystem using Fish as 
Indicators".  The results of this study have provide information on the 
ecology and fisheries of the York River that is essential for wise 
stewardship of this precious but threatened community resource.  The 
goal of this project was to assist the York Rivers Association and 
partners in their work as stewards of the York River and its watershed, 
through an assessment of the current and potential fish habitat 
value of this exemplary coastal ecosystem. The project results are 
currently being written up.

The Wells NERR Research Dept. is involved with the following two 
CICEET* Projects-

I. Project Title: Estuarine Responses to Dredging: Analysis of 
Sedimentary and Morphological Change in Back Barrier Marsh to Aid Local 
Management and Develop a Regional Management Tool
Principal Investigator(s): Michele Dionne, Wells NERR, ME; Duncan Fitzgerald, Boston 
University; Joe Kelley, University of Maine; David Burdick and Larry 
Ward, University of New Hampshire

Management Issue: Coastal management tool for assessing the impacts of 
dredging in estuaries
Project Summary: An adequate supply of sediment is 
essential for maintaining salt marshes.  Human activities, such as 
channel dredging and tidal restriction due to road construction, can 
alter water flows in estuaries and result in dramatic changes in salt 
marsh sediment supply, affecting the speed of salt marsh erosion.  The 
objective of this project is to determine the impact of dredging and 
tidal restriction on salt marshes in the Wells NERR.  A digital coastal 
management guide will be created on CD ROM, providing coastal managers 
with useful conceptual models for predicting the impacts of dredging 
and other activities that affect water flow and sediment deposition in 
salt marshes.

II. Project Title: Application of a Continuous Imaging Flow Cytometer 
for Monitoring Estuarine Microplankton 
Principal Investigators: Mike Sieracki and Chris. Sieracki, 
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Studies

Management Issue: New technology for detecting harmful algal blooms
Project Summary: Marine plankton is a significant component of highly 
productive estuaries, affecting the distribution of oxygen, nutrients, 
and contaminants. Estuarine marine plankton is also the primary food 
for the larvae of many commercially and ecologically important finfish 
and shellfish. In addition to their highly productive role, some 
species of plankton occasionally form nuisance or toxic blooms that 
affect human health as well as fish and shellfish. This project is 
developing an imaging system, called FlowCam, to continuously 
monitor plankton for the presence and abundance of harmful algal 
species.  The same technology could also be used to monitor the effects 
of harbor dredging on plankton.

The Wells NERR Research Dept. is assisting with the maintenance and 
data collection of the FlowCAM instrument and FlowCAM computer.

The following erroneous Air_TempC data was caused by an undocumented 
and unexplained glitch or power down that caused the CR10X to reset and 
record erroneous hourly averages and daily averages. The erroneous data 
on 19(353) might be due to the changing of the air temperature probe 
that occurred at an uncertain time that day. Data was edited 
accordingly for arrays 101 and arrays 241, 243, 244:

13. Other Remarks

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data 
collected with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was 
distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the 
old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums 
every fifteen minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day 
(array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 
and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   the hourly 
101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, 
the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing 
data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP 
weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed 
and left blank.  


LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points. 


Due to missing data (see section 12), certain monthly rain totals are incomplete
and not available, and not all rain events may be accounted for because of this.
