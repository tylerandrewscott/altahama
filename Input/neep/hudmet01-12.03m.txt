2. Entry verification:
 	
	The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
sensor on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The sensors 
and data collection schedule (Section 4) were controlled by the CDMO Datalogger 
Program (hud30.csi), which was loaded onto the CR10X.  The CR10X stored the data, 
via cable, on a Campbell Scientific SM 192 storage module.  The storage module was 
manually retrieved at the end of every month.  Using the PC208W software supplied by 
Campbell Scientific, the data were uploaded from the storage module and stored on a 
computer.  All raw data files were archived at the CDMO and at the reserve on CD-
ROM.  
 	After data upload, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program (WDMP) was 
used to convert the data into database format.  This program was developed in Visual 
Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule.  There were three main tasks 
completed by the WDMP:  conversion of the comma delimited monthly raw data file 
(.DAT) into a Microsoft Access database, checking the data against a predetermined set 
of error criteria (Section 4), and production of error and summary reports.  Anomalous 
data were investigated and documented in Section 11.  The most commonly reported 
error was wind speed below the 0.5 m/s criteria.  Missing data were documented in 
Section 12.  
	On October 23, 2003 the CDMO datalogger program NERR_4.csi was loaded onto the CR10X.  
The new program corrected many problems encountered with the previous program.  Data 
were stored via cable on a Campbell Scientific SM 4M storage module and uploaded as 
described previously.  Raw data files (.DAT) were opened in Microsoft Excel for pre-
processing with the EQWin format macro, developed by the CDMO.  EQwin now replaces the 
WDMP as the NERR MET primary QA/QC program. The macro reformats the header columns, 
inserts station codes, inserts a date column, corrects the time column format, and 
reformats the data to an appropriate number of decimal places.  The pre-processed 
file was then copied into EQWin, where the data were QA/QC'd and archived in a database.  
EQWin queries, reports and graphs were used to discover outliers and large changes in 
the data.  Any anomalous data were investigated and noted as previously described.

The Research Assistant is responsible for data verification.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  


3. Research objectives:

	The objective of this study is to monitor the meteorological conditions at the 
Tivoli Bays component site of the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve.  
Measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, 
photosynthetically active radiation, and wind speed and direction are taken throughout 
the year at the Tivoli Bays Field Station.  A water quality monitoring program has been 
ongoing since 1991 at this component site, and the meteorological monitoring provides 
ancillary data.   This helps us to better understand the relationships between the 
atmospheric conditions and aquatic environments at this site. 

4. Research methods:

	For routine maintenance, sensors were investigated at least once a month to 
ensure there was no damage or blockage.  According to Campbell Scientific, sensors are 
to be calibrated every 1-2 years for proper data collection. Sensors were shipped to their 
respective manufacturers for proper and professional calibration.  In order to avoid 
missing data, two sets of sensors are available.  Upon return from the manufacturers, 
newly calibrated sensors were used to replace the sensors on the tower.

For data collection, the CR10X datalogger was programmed to collect data in the 
following formats:
i)	15-minute data are collected instantaneously for Air Temperature (C), 
Relative Humidity (%), Barometric Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and 
Wind Direction (degrees).  15-minute Precipitation (mm) and PAR 
(mmol/m^2) data are totaled from 5-second readings, prior to NERR_4.CSI
ii)	15-minute average, maximum and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb) and Wind Speed (m/s) with NERR_4.CSI.
iii)	Hourly average, maximum, and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Hourly 
totals for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute 
readings.
iv)	Daily average, maximum and minumum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Daily totals 
for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute readings.

Data were stored on a Campbell Scientific storage module (SM192 or SM4M), which 
was retrieved monthly.  The data were downloaded and pre-processed as described in 
Section 2.  QA/QC of the data was conducted using either the WDMP or EQWin.  
WDMP error reports and EQWin queries were based on the following anomalous data 
criteria:

-Wind speed not greater than 30 m/s (EQWin only)
-Wind speed not less than 0.5 m/s for 12 consecutive hours (EQWin only)

Wind Direction:
- Wind direction not greater than 360 degrees or less than 0 degrees

Rainfall:
- Precipitation not greater than 5 mm in 15 min
- No precipitation for the month (WDMP only)

5. Site location and character:
	The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a multi-
component site totaling approximately 5,000 acres.  Each component of the reserve is 
referenced by River Mile (RM) of the Hudson River in New York State proceeding north 
from the southern tip of Manhattan (RM 0).  The reserve includes the following four 
component sites:  Piermont Marsh, Rockland County (RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W), 
Iona Island, Rockland County (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 73o58'45"W), Tivoli Bays, Dutchess 
County (RM 98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), and Stockport Flats, Columbia County (RM 
124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W).  The four component sites include open water, tidal 
wetland, and adjacent upland buffer habitats and are representative of the diverse plant 
and animal communities that occupy the salinity gradient within the Hudson River 
Estuary.  Development within the watersheds of the four component sites ranges from 
predominantly urban/suburban to forested/agricultural.
	The weather station (FS) is located at the Tivoli Bays component site in 
Annandale, NY (42°01'05.46"N 73°55'01.13"W).  The weather monitoring equipment is 
mounted on a 30-foot aluminum tower.  The tower is on the west side deck of the office 
building, 9 feet off the ground.  The wind anemometer and wind speed sensors are 
located at the top of the tower, 39 feet off the ground.  The light sensor is attached to the 
tower, 16 feet off the ground.  The datalogger and the barometric pressure sensor are 
enclosed within a fiberglass case attached to the tower, 12 feet off the ground.  A heated 
rain gauge is next to the tower, attached to the building, 16 feet off the ground.  The 
temperature/humidity sensor is next to the tower, attached to the deck handrail, 12 feet 
off the ground.  Although trees surround the area, the tree line begins approximately 60 
feet from the tower in most directions.  The trees are at similar heights to the tower, but 
the sensors are not shaded at that location.  The tower is approximately 1.2 miles 
Southeast of the Tivoli South Bay water quality monitoring station, 2.3 miles Southeast 
of the Tivoli North Bay water quality monitoring station, and 0.2 miles Northwest of the 
Saw Kill Creek water quality monitoring station.

6. Data collection period:

	Weather data were collected for the entire year in 2003.  Weather data have been 
collected at the Field Station at Tivoli Bays since July 1999.

8. Associated researchers and projects:

	The Hudson River NERR water quality-monitoring program examines the 
physical and chemical constituents of the tributary waters and the tidal waters of the 
freshwater tidal marshes at the Tivoli Bays component site.   Measurements include 
seston, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, pH, temperature, salinity, conductivity, and 
concentrations of nitrate, phosphate, sulfate, and chloride.  These data are used in 
conjunction with the meterological monitoring data to help us better understand the 
relationships between the atmospheric and aquatic environments at this site.

Anomalous wind speed readings (i.e. "wind speed is less than 0.5m/s") were listed as 
possible errors.  The sensor was operating properly and the readings are attributed to low 
wind conditions.  The following data were left in:

October 2003

The weather station was powered down for installation of new CR10x program at 07:40 
on 10/23/2003.  All data after 07:45 (15-minute) and 08:00 (hourly) and daily totals from 
10/23/03 are reported missing in Access and WDMP.  

Data collection began again at 09:45 on 10/23/03 and these data are reported in EQWin.  
Hourly averages (Array 60) at 10:00 on 10/23/03 and daily averages (Array 144) at 00:00 
on 10/24/04 were removed due to the loss of 5-second data used to calculate these 
averages.

The temperature/relative humidity sensor was wired improperly for data collection with 
the new program. Data are missing until 10:15 on 10/23/03 when the problem was 
corrected.  Hourly averages (Array 60) for temperature and relative humidity at 11:00 on 
10/23/03 were removed due to loss of 5-second data used to calculate these averages.

13. Other Remarks/notes:

LiCor (PAR):  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 10/23/2003, all PAR values 
less than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0.  These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.  After 
installation of the new program, queries in EQWin were constructed to identify PAR 
values below –0.5, because values between 0 and –0.5 typically occur at night and are 
within the normal operating range of the sensor.  Values less than –0.5 are considered 
anomalous, and are investigated further.  Values between 0 and –0.5 that occur during the 
day are evident from graphs of the PAR data and are considered anomalous and 
investigated further.     
 
Relative Humidity: 
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program on 10/23/2003, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points. After 
installation of the new program, queries in EQWin were constructed to identify relative 
humidity readings greater than 100%.  Values greater than 100% are considered 
anomalous and are investigated further.
