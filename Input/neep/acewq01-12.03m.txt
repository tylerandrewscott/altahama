2.	Entry verification:
	The data are directly downloaded from the Model 6600EDS sonde to comma-
delimited files (*.csv) and PC6000 files (*.dat). The comma-delimited files are 
imported into Excel 98 where they are formatted and processed by macros that are 
supplied by the Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO). Various macros are 
designed to: 1) check data files for missing data points, 2) fill all cells that 
do not contain data with periods (.), 3) convert the data columns to the CDMO-
approved formats for time, date and numeric variables, 4) find all data that are 
out of acceptable range for the data logger's sensors and output the anomalous 
data to an output file (*.dat), and 5) save the files as Excel worksheets 
(*.xls). Periods were later removed for data dissemination purposes and left 
blank. 
	The anomalous data are evaluated to determine whether to flag or delete 
the suspect data.  Data are flagged if the values are: 1) outside the range 
expected for the site, 2) outside the range of measurements established for the 
sensors, 3) outside the range of accuracy established for the sensors, or 4) 
outside the range established for good water quality conditions (i.e., dissolved 
oxygen <28%).  Data are deleted if the anomalies are attributed to: 1) a sensor 
malfunction, 2) exposure of sensors during low tides, or 3) fouling of sensors 
by aquatic organisms, debris, or sediment.  Sensor malfunctions are detected if 
the voltage reading of the sensor is outside the range established for the 
sensor or the sensor will not calibrate.  Fouling of sensors is detected by 
comparing in-situ sensor readings with measurements (see Research Methods 
section).  In addition, sensor readings that differ significantly (>10%) from 
standard solution (i.e., conductivity) suggest that the sensor was fouled during 
deployment.  After corrections are made to the Excel worksheet (*.xls), the 
files are exported as tab-delimited files  (*.txt) to the CDMO.  Saundra 
Upchurch and Amy Whitaker Dukes are responsible for these tasks.

3.	Research Objectives:
	The ACE Basin water quality-monitoring program began on March 3, 1995 at 
two tributaries off Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks (see Site Location and 
Character section for description of sites).  The water quality deployment sites 
were constructed prior to the first deployment (see Research Methods section).  
Initially, the YSI electronic data loggers, at Big Bay and St. Pierre Creeks, 
were programmed to measure the water temperature, specific conductance, 
dissolved oxygen, water level, and pH at 15-minute intervals (the sampling 
interval was changed to 30 minutes prior to the August 11, 1995 deployment 
period).  Starting April 11, 1996 deployment period, turbidity monitoring was 
added to the program.  In 2002, the SWMP program expanded the spatial coverage 
of the monitoring program to include two additional data logger deployment 
sites. In October of 2002, water quality data loggers were deployed in Fishing 
Creek and Mosquito Creek.
	Based on discussions with local Coastal Zone Management (CZM) personnel 
and our knowledge of land use within the Reserve, the South Edisto River 
drainage basin appears well suited for studying contrasting hydrographic 
conditions and land use patterns. One NERR water quality monitoring station has 
been established near Edisto Beach within a tributary of Big Bay Creek.  
Surrounded by residential and commercial development and subject to nonpoint 
source pollution, this station is designated as the "treatment" site.  The 
second NERR water quality monitoring station has been situated near Bailey 
Island, within a tributary of St. Pierre Creek.  Urban development in the 
immediate area of this station has been sparse to date so this station will 
serve as the "control" site.  Similar to the two initial monitoring stations, 
the new sites contrast hydrographic conditions, land use patterns in the ACE.  
The third NERR water quality-monitoring station is located within a tributary of 
Fishing Creek on Jehosse Island, and both the South Edisto and North Edisto 
Rivers influence the creek.  The island is owned and operated by the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service and serves as a wildlife refuge for native and migrating 
birds and many of South Carolina's endangered species.  This station will serve 
as a second "control" site.  The fourth NERR water quality monitoring station is 
situated in Mosquito Creek, a tributary of the Ashepoo River.  Surrounded by 
rural development and agriculture, Mosquito Creek is subject to increased 
nutrient loading and possibly herbicides and pesticides.  This station will 
serve as a second "treatment" site.
	In July 1997, the Reserve staff initiated nutrient studies.  The objective 
of the study is to ascertain the annual and tidal fluctuations in nutrient 
levels near our two data logger sites. Nutrient levels are measured during a 
complete tidal cycle each month, and the samples are analyzed for ammonia, 
nitrite-nitrate, and ortho-phosphate concentrations.  In February of 2002, 
nutrient collection and analysis was established and became apart of the SWMP 
protocol.  Nutrients and Chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly at all four 
deployment sites, and a diel (24-hour sampling) is conducted monthly at St. 
Pierre Creek.

4.	Research Methods
	Each data logger is deployed at each permanent monitoring station, three 
in the South Edisto River watershed and one in the Ashepoo watershed.  Each 
deployment mount is cleaned and maintained on a monthly basis.  The monitoring 
station at Big Bay Creek was constructed in 1995, and consisted of a PVC pipe 
mounted vertically on a pole. This monitoring station was replaced in October of 
2001 because of its old age, high potential for fouling to the data, and growth 
of oysters on the mount.  The new mount consisted of two 5-foot PVC pipes 
mounted vertically on two overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles.  The new mount 
design allowed for easy access to the YSI data sondes.  To facilitate water flow 
across the sensors, approximately one-inch diameter holes were drilled into the 
PVC pipes.  The pipes are also positioned to ensure that the sensors are 
approximately 0.5 meters from the creek bottom.  The Big Bay monitoring station 
was moved to a new location on July 1, 2003 because the embankment near the data 
sonde collapsed in to the creek, making the creek nearly impassable by boat, 
even at high tide.  Large amounts of sedimentation began to build in the creek 
in April of 2003.  This phenomena caused a steady decline in water depth, which 
caused the data sonde to experience more "out of the water" periods. The 
increased sediment loading was probably responsible for the turbidity probe 
failure, two broken pH probe bulbs, and two punctured DO membranes that occurred 
within three deployments.  The mount at the new site consists of a stainless 
steal triangular-shaped cage, which rests on the creek bottom supporting the 
data sonde in PVC pipe approximately 0.5 meters from the creek bottom.  To 
facilitate water flow across the sensors, approximately one-inch diameter 
holes were drilled into the PVC pipes.
	In 1997, the St. Pierre Creek station was modified: the PVC pipe is 
mounted horizontally in a pyramid-shaped cage (2.5 ft long x 1.5 ft high) 
tethered to the original 12-foot galvanized pole.  Later that year, we began to 
put the data loggers in 1/8-inch mesh net bags before placing them in the PVC 
pipe to reduce damage by crabs and fish.  In April of 2000, the St. Pierre 
station was moved and modified.  The station was moved to the other side of the 
creek, and the pyramid-shaped cage was deployed vertically at the base of the 
pole. In September of 2001, the St. Pierre deployment mount was replaced with 
three 5-foot PVC pipes mounted vertically on two overlapping 12-foot galvanized 
poles. To facilitate water flow across the sensors, approximately one-inch 
diameter holes were drilled into the PVC pipes.  The Fishing Creek monitoring 
station was constructed in October of 2002, and is a non-fixed deployment mount. 
It consists of a 5-gallon bucket cut in half and filled with concrete, which 
serves to anchor.  The entire mount is lifted off the creek bottom in order to 
retrieve and deploy YSI data loggers. Changes in depth between individual 
deployments may be experienced because this deployment mount is non-fixed/ PVC 
pipe is attached horizontally, with floats fastened at either end, to the bucket 
with a one-foot lead line through a stainless steal eyebolt set in the concrete.  
When the data logger is deployed, it floats horizontally approximately 0.5 
meters from the creek bottom.  In October of 2002, the Mosquito Creek monitoring 
station was constructed using three overlapping 12-foot galvanized poles with 
three 5-foot PVC pipes mounted vertically. To facilitate water flow across the 
sensors, approximately two-inch diameter holes were drilled into the PVC pipes.  
The deployment mount is secured by u-brackets to a bridge for extra support.  
During the summer, the data loggers are left at the sites for one to two weeks, 
and the sampling period is extended up to one month during the cooler months.
	At the end of the sampling period, the data loggers are brought back to 
the laboratory for cleaning, post calibration, and servicing, by methods 
outlined in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  After cleaning the data 
loggers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) membrane is replaced and is allowed to 
stretch for 24 hours before calibration begins.  The pH, conductivity, depth, 
and turbidity sensors are calibrated, using the following standards: pH 7 and 
10, conductivity standard of 58.64mS/cm, depth in the air, and turbidity 
standards of 0 and 123 NTU, respectively for the 6136 turbidity probe.  The 
water level sensor is zeroed in air, and the chlorophyll is zeroed in 
distilled water.  The DO sensor is calibrated in air-saturated water.  In 
addition to the procedures outlined in the CDMO manual, we conduct a DO membrane 
integrity test prior to deployment to determine if the membrane was damaged 
during calibration.
	Several quality assurance checks are used to determine if the sensor 
readings drifted significantly during deployment. In-situ measurements of 
dissolved oxygen, expressed in mg/L, salinity, pH, and water temperature are 
taken during deployment and retrieval of the data sondes. Water samples are 
collected at the same depth as the sensors.  Water temperature, salinity, and pH 
are measured directly with a thermistor, refractometer and pH meter, 
respectively, and dissolved oxygen level is determined by the Winkler titration.  
As of November 2001, second sets of in-situ measurements are recorded using an 
YSI 600 XL data sonde with an YSI 650 Multi-Parameter Display System (MDS).  
	Post-deployment measurements of all the parameters except turbidity are 
taken before cleaning the data loggers.  Turbidity is post calibrated after the 
sonde has been cleaned to insure the accuracy of the standard.  Sensors are 
immersed in the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., pH) and readings are 
recorded. A DO membrane integrity test also is conducted to determine if the 
membrane was damaged during deployment.  The results of these checks are used to 
evaluate the validity of the data (see Post Deployment Information section).

5. Site Locations and Character:
	ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve is one of the largest 
undeveloped estuaries on the East Coast. The study area encompasses the Ashepoo, 
Combahee and South Edisto River basins, which empty into St. Helena Sound.  The 
NERR consists of approximately 150,000 acres of diverse estuarine wetlands 
providing preserved habitats for fish and wildlife 	Three sampling sites are 
in separate tributaries of the South Edisto River and one is in a tributary of 
the Ashepoo River.  Each site averages a year round tidal range of approximately 
2.0 m (6.5 feet), with a maximum of 2.48 m (8.2 feet) and a minimum of 1.45 m 
(4.8 feet). The bottom habitat at each of the four sites consists of mud 
intermixed with dead shell hash. The descriptions of the sites are as follows: 

Station A - GPS coordinates: 32.4897N and -80.3202W (January thru June 2003): 
This site is in a tributary off the tidal marsh Big Bay Creek. The site was 
moved in late June 2003 to Big Bay Creek proper and the GPS coordinates of the 
new site is 32.4941N and -80.3241W (July thru December 2003)
	Surrounded by residential and commercial development and subject to 
nonpoint source pollution, the Big Bay station is designated as a "treatment" 
site. Pollution sources include houses bordering the creek, many of them with 
little setbacks from the bordering Spartina marsh; forty docks in the area 
constructed of creosote, concrete and Wolmanized pilings; boat dockage and 
heavy boat traffic through the creek; a paved road and three boat ramps off the 
creek; a marina with 75 slips, CCA treated bulkheads and fueling areas located 
about 0.5 miles downstream; two commercial seafood docks with 8-10 commercial 
shrimp boats; and three restaurants. The creek is closed to shellfish harvesting 
because of the human development in the vicinity. Vegetation in the area 
includes salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora with isolated areas of 
Salicornia. Upland fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live oak and 
cedars. Reefs of American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fringe the creek banks.  
In 2003, the yearly average creek depth at a late ebb tide was 2.0 m (6.6 feet) 
and the salinity at a late ebb tide was 24.5 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station B - GPS coordinates: 32.5233N and -80.3568W 
	The St. Pierre station is in a tributary of St. Pierre Creek. It is 
surrounded by a wide expanse of Spartina alterniflora marsh. Extensive mud flats 
and oyster reefs fringe the banks.  Maritime forest communities comprised of 
species such as wax myrtles, live oaks, and palmettos dominate the upland areas.  
This station is designated as a "control" site, because development in the 
immediate area is sparse, and the creek is subject to relatively light boat 
traffic.  In 2003, the yearly average creek depth at a late ebb tide was 2.1 m 
(6.9 feet) and the salinity at a late ebb tide was 22.5 parts per thousand 
(ppt).

Station C – GPS coordinates: 32.6358 N and -80.3655W 
	The Fishing Creek station is in Fishing Creek proper. Located within the 
boundaries of Jehossee Island, a protected Wildlife Management Area, this site 
is surrounded by extensive Spartina cynosuroides marsh and vast mud flats.  The 
upland areas of Jehosse Island consist of long leaf pines, live oaks, and 
contain managed drainage impoundments.  Once considered working rice fields, 
these impoundments are well-managed wetlands filled with thriving brackish 
marshes and not subject to pesticides and herbicides.  Relatively subject to 
light boat traffic (i.e. commercial crab harvesters) and sparse development, 
this station is designated as a "control" site.  In 2003, the yearly average 
creek depth at a late ebb tide was 1.9 m (6.3 feet) and the salinity at a 
late ebb tide was 1.9 parts per thousand (ppt).

Station D – GPS coordinates: 32.5558 N and -80.4380W 
	The Mosquito Creek station is in Mosquito Creek proper. Surrounded by 
intermediate rural, residential and agricultural development, and subject to 
nonpoint source pollution, this station is designated as a "treatment" site. 
Several impoundment trunks open and drain into the creek increasing the nutrient 
load and possibly introducing herbicides and pesticides.  Other pollution 
sources include several houses bordering the creek, ten docks constructed of 
creosote, concrete and Wolmanized pilings; medium boat traffic through the 
creek; one boat ramps off the creek; a commercial seafood and fueling area is 
located about 0.5 miles downstream, with three commercial shrimp boats. 
Vegetation in the area includes salt marsh dominated by Spartina alterniflora 
and Juncus roemerianus.  Upland fringe areas consist of cabbage palmetto, live 
oaks and pine trees.  In 2003, the yearly average creek depth at a late ebb tide 
was 3.5 m (11.5 feet) and the salinity at a late ebb tide was 3.5 parts per 
thousand (ppt).

	The following discussions of trends in water quality at Big Bay and St. 
Pierre monitoring stations are based on data collected from March 1995 through 
December 1997.  During this period, water temperature at both monitoring sites 
exhibited a seasonal pattern with lowest values occurring in December-January.  
The lowest monthly water temperature observed was 8.9 oC, which occurred in 
February 1996 at St. Pierre Creek; whereas maximum temperatures occurred in 
July and August with the highest monthly water temperature 38.9 oC occurring in 
July 1995 at Big Bay Creek.  Diurnal variation in temperature was evident with 
warmest temperatures occurring from 1300 hr to 1800 hr at both sites.  Salinity 
also exhibited seasonal variability during the same period, with lowest values 
occurring in March at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks.  Another period of low 
average monthly salinity occurred at Big Bay Creek in December 1997.  Average 
annual salinity for both sites was in the polyhaline regime, with a mean of 29.4 
‰ at Big Bay Creek and 26.3‰ at St. Pierre Creek; however, for all years, 
salinity ranged from 0.3-41.7 ‰ at Big Bay and from 0-41.7‰ at St. Pierre Creek.  
Local precipitation and evaporation conditions are most likely the major 
contributors to monthly variability in salinity.  Analysis of the data indicates 
that tidal stage strongly influences salinity.  As expected, highest values of 
salinity occurred on the flood tide. 
	It appears that tidal stage also influences pH. Spectral analysis revealed 
a periodicity for pH and water depth with a sinusoidal period at ~ 12 hrs., 
representing tidal periodicity.  Time series plots of pH indicated variability 
of ~1 standard unit (su) on a daily basis. The pH at both sites was very 
similar, ranging from 5.3-8.4; however, the preponderance of measurements were 
>7 at both sites.  The pH observed at the two monitoring sites appears to be 
attributable to natural conditions. Marked variations in pH can also occur 
diurnally due to changes in primary production and respiration.
	Dissolved oxygen concentrations appeared to track depth for part of the 
cycle, with lowest values occurring on low tides.  Afternoon and evening values 
were not as low as early morning values, suggesting a diurnal component.  
Dissolved oxygen values at the two monitoring sites were generally high 
throughout the year with averages of 83.6% saturation and 6.6 mg/l for Big Bay 
Creek and 78.5% saturation and 6.3 mg/l for St. Pierre Creek, with highest 
values in winter and lowest in summer.  Hypoxic events (<28% air saturation) 
were observed in every season, but summer was clearly the season with the 
greatest percent of time when DO was <28%. Whereas, supersaturation (>100% air 
saturation) occurred primarily in the winter, with values exceeding 120% at both 
creeks. There are a few differences among the sites such as, hypoxic conditions 
occur more frequently at St. Pierre Creek.
	Unlike the other parameters monitored at Big Bay and St. Pierre creeks, 
there appears to be no distinct seasonal trend in turbidity; however, monthly 
variability appeared greater at the St. Pierre site. This may be due to 
fluctuations in the amount of detritus being washed from the extensive salt 
marsh and upland sites that surround St. Pierre Creek.
	It appears that metal leachates from the pilings, even the new ones, in 
reasonably tidal flushed areas, along Big Bay Creek have negligible ecological 
effects, according to the 1994 study by Weis and Weis.  Their findings indicated 
that concentrations of the metals (Cr, Cu, and As) in sediments adjacent to 
pilings along Big Bay Creek were generally not significantly elevated, and there 
were no consistent differences in the benthic communities between the Big Bay 
and St. Pierre monitoring sites.
	However, the highest values of PAHs encountered (299.0 ng/g) during a 
study by Drs. Geoff Scott and Tom Mathews from 1993-1995 were in the South 
Edisto watershed at Big Bay Creek; this station also had detectable levels of 
PCBs, concentrations as well.  Whereas, the concentrations in St. Pierre Creek 
were below the level of detection for persistent pesticides and for PCBs.  At 
most 34 sites, contaminant levels were below the level of detection for 
persistent pesticides and for PCBs, suggesting that the ACE is a relatively 
pristine system.
	Fishing Creek and Mosquito Creek data collection began in October of 2002, 
and with the limited data collected, accurate discussions of trends in water 
quality at these monitoring stations are not feasible.

8. 	Associated researchers and projects:
	Dr. Charles Wenner of SCDNR/Marine Resources Research Institute received 
funding through the National Marine Fisheries Service in January of 2001 to 
continue an ongoing survey of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) in the South Edisto 
and Combahee River basins, by electrofishing in tidal freshwater and low 
salinity brackish water.  Although red drum are the target species, all 
species identified to species, measured and weighed.
	The ACE Basin NERR received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency to establish a National Atmospheric Deposition Program site in the 
Reserve. Sampling efforts began on January 1, 2002 and will continue for five 
years. Weekly precipitation samples are collected and analyzed for atmospheric 
pollutants.  The precipitation collector is located on Bear Island, a Wildlife 
Management Area inside the NERR.
	In August of 2003, the Reserve participated in a beta test of the new YSI 
flat glass pH probe, Model #6561FG.  The ACE Basin was one of five estuarine 
sites, selected by Mike Lizotte at ENDECO/YSI, to collect pH data using this new 
probe.  The new probes design has two significant advantages to the current pH 
probe, Model #6561.  First, when used in conjunction with the YSI 6600EDS data 
sonde, the probes glass face is cleaned much more efficiently, and second, 
the glass on the face of the probe is thicker, which eliminates most mechanisms 
for breakage.  YSI will offer this new pH probe in June of 2004.
	The ACE Basin participated in the NOAA funded, NERR Invasive Decapod Pilot 
project. Sampling efforts began in August of 2002 and continued through June of 
2003.  Utilizing the established NERR systems, four northwestern NERR sites and 
five southeastern NERR sites were selected to participate in the pilot project.  
The project was designed to understand which crabs have invaded which sites.  
Identical crab collectors were deployed at the participating Reserves, 
and all crabs found in collectors were identified, measured, and counted.  The 
sex and general condition of crabs (reproductive status, molt stage, obvious 
parasites, etc.) were noted as well.
	Dr. Clark Alexander of Skidaway Institute and ACE Basin Reserve staff 
conducted a spatial distribution of salinity in each of the rivers of the ACE 
Basin in September of 2002 and April 2003.
	Information about other studies conducted in the ACE Basin may be obtained 
from the Research Coordinator.

June 1-30, 2003 Sampling Period
Big Bay
	a)	During the following periods, the depth readings are negative.  The 
depth data were not deleted because the salinity and dissolved oxygen readings 
indicate the data logger was submerged during these periods.
06/01/03	01:30:00-03:30:00; 14:00:00

	b)	During the following periods, the salinity and specific conductivity 
readings are not within the normal polyhaline/euhaline salinity range, 18 and 40 
ppt.  The data sonde frequently recorded salinities below 18 ppt as a result of 
the large freshwater discharge from the South Edisto River.  From March to 
August of 2003, the river was experiencing flood conditions, which caused the 
river stage to rise above 10 feet.  The average height of the South Edisto River 
in June was 10.19 feet.

	c)	During the following periods, salinity, specific conductivity, 
dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), and depth readings were deleted.  Specific 
conductivity 
readings were deleted because the conductivity probe was partially exposed, and 
the depth readings were deleted because the depth sensor went dry. Salinity and 
DO readings were deleted because these values are calculated based on specific 
conductivity reading.

12.	Missing Data
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later removed 
for data dissemination purposes and left blank. Data are missing due to 
equipment failure, probes not installed, maintenance/calibration of equipment, 
elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to calibration (both 
pre and post) problems.  For more details on deleted data, see the Anomalous 
Data Section (11.).  To find out more details about missing data, contact the 
Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

14.	Other Remarks

Salinity Blanket Statement:
South Carolina experienced drought conditions from June 1998 thru April 2003.  
Beginning in the winter of 2002, the state was frequently inundated with 
rainfall.  This rainfall helped to alleviate the lingering effects of the 
drought; however, the rainfall extending thru the summer of 2003 had a 
pronounced and prolonged effect on the discharge of coastal watersheds.  The 
South Edisto River was above flood stage (Crest at 10 feet +) from March to 
August of 2003.  The SWMP YSI stations recorded decreased salinities as a result 
of the freshwater discharge from the river.

Big Bay Creek: 
The data sonde was located in a small tributary off Big Bay Creek.  Large 
amounts of sedimentation began to build in the creek in April of 2003.  There 
was a steady decline in water depth, which caused the data sonde to experience 
some out of the water periods.  The building sediments later shifted and eroded, 
resulting in two broken pH probe bulbs, two punctured DO membranes, and one 
turbidity probe failure within three deployments. Part of the embankment near 
the data sonde collapsed in to the creek, making the creek nearly impassable by 
boat even at high tide and placing the data sonde at a higher risk of being 
damaged.  The data sonde was retrieved and redeployed at a new location on July 
1, 2003 to allow for safe and more efficient data collection.

Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Blanket Statements: 
a)	DO less than 28% air saturation (hypoxia) is frequently observed in the 
ACE Basin NERR during the warmer months, especially from May to September; 
hypoxia also was observed from March and April in St. Pierre Creek, Fishing 
Creek, and Mosquito Creek.  Hypoxia events are common in the salt march 
environment and typically occur during late ebb, low slack, and early flood 
tides.  Natural factors contribute to these low DO measurements 
including insufficient water circulation, elevated water temperature, and the 
lack of stratification in shallow estuarine habitats.
b)	DO measurements between 100% and 120% air saturation are not listed in the 
metadata.  These DO readings consistently occur in the ACE Basin NERR and are 
not considered to be suspect.  DO measurements recorded above 100% will often 
subsequently result in high DO mg/l reading like those recorded in St. Pierre 
and Fishing Creeks in December 2003.
c)	DO greater than 120% air saturation (supersaturation) is frequently 
observed in the ACE Basin NERR during the colder months, especially in February 
and March in Big Bay Creek.  Supersaturation events are not uncommon in shallow 
estuarine waters and usually occur during afternoon daylight hours as water 
temperature rises, thus elevating primary productivity.  The supersaturation 
event in February corresponded with the highest water levels, suggesting an 
environmental cause.

Depth (meters) Blanket Statement: Negative depth readings were recorded in both 
St. Pierre and Big Bay Creeks.  The data were not deleted because the salinity 
and dissolved oxygen readings indicated the data logger was submerged during 
these periods. The depth sensor on an YSI data sonde is calibrated inside a 
laboratory using a barometric pressure of 760 millabars.  Changes in barometric 
pressure while the data sonde is deployed often result in negative depth values, 
especially at low tides.

Turbidity (NTU) Blanket Statement: Turbidity readings greater than 1000 NTU are 
recorded at all YSI sites. The high spikes were possibly caused by an animal, a 
clump of plant matter, or sediment that passed by the sensor optics during the 
sampling interval.  Furthermore, a low tide and/or rainfall event may contribute 
to the turbidity spiking.
