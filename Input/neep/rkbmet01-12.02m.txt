2) Entry verification

a)	Data Input Procedures

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  The CDMO 
Data Logger Program (nerr30.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and 
data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule).  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by 
Campbell Scientific.  

This software was located on a laptop computer to which the data was downloaded 
approximately every two weeks.  The data was saved as a monthly raw data file (RAW 
0100.dat) onto a separate hard drive and backed up onto the Rookery Bay NERR Lab server.  

Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather Data Management Program 
(WDMP) is used to convert the files to an Access database.  This program was developed in 
Visual Basic to interface with the NERR Meteorological Data Collection Schedule (see 2b 
of the Entry Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and Access database.  
There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  

First, it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access database.  
Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Appendix 
G for the CDMO Meteorological Data Collection Error/Anomalous Data Criteria).  Finally, 
it produces error and summary reports.  Any anomalous data were investigated and are 
noted below in the Anomalous Data Section.  Any data corrections that were performed are 
noted in the Data Correction Section below.  

Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind speeds below the 0.5 m/s 
criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15-minute period, and precipitation 
difference of greater than 5mm in 15 minutes.  All errors of these types were double 
checked with other data that could support such "anomalous" weather changes and noted in 
the sections that follow.  

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank. 

b) Data Collection Schedule

	i) Data is collected in the following formats:

		1) 15 minute data are instantaneous readings except for PAR and precipitation 
		data that are totalized from 5 second samples sorted by date and time. 		
		(Arrays 150 and 151)
		2) Hourly averages (Arrays 101 and 102) are calculated from 5 second 
		samples sorted by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data that 	
		are hourly totals calculated from 15 minute totals (Arrays 105 and 106).
		3) Daily average (arrays 241 and 242), maximum with time, and minimum 
		with time (arrays 243 and 244) are calculated from 5 second samples sorted 
		by date and time except for PAR and precipitation data which are 24 hour 
		totals calculated from hourly totals (arrays 245 and 246).

3) Research objectives 

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data for Rookery Bay in 
order to observe any environmental changes or trends over time.  Secondary objectives 
include using the meteorological data to help document periodic biological and 
environmental events such as:  fish kills, red tides, wildfires, prescribed burns, and 
hurricanes/tropical storms.  It also supports all research conducted at the reserve 
including providing valuable ancillary data for the reserve's water quality monitoring 
program.


4) Research methods

The Campbell Scientific weather station samples every 5 seconds to produce both hourly 
and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, 
barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is 
taken every 15 minutes and that data is stored in array 150.  The data is downloaded at 
the storage module to a laptop and brought back to the lab for uploading following 
procedures in Part D. Section 4.5 of the CDMO Operations Manual.  Periodically, sensors 
on the weather station are inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is 
repaired and/or cleaned.  The rain gauge tends to collect the most debris and needs to be 
cleaned out every few days.  Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for 
calibration at minimum of every two years.  There were no other analyses done on the 
meteorological data at present.  


5) Site location and character

Rookery Bay's weather station is located at our Shell Island Road Laboratory which is 
adjacent to the mouth of Henderson Creek (where the creek enters Rookery Bay).

Latitude:	26° 01.492' N
Longitude:	81° 43.895' W


Rookery Bay is located in the Tropical Rainy climatic group of Koppen (1931), i.e. the 
area below a west-east line extending from Ft. Myers to Melbourne, and where the mean 
temperature does not fall below 17.7°C (64°F) in the coolest month of the year.  Owing to 
the influence of the warm-water Florida Current, the seasonal effects from the Gulf of 
Mexico Loop Current, and its geographical position at 26° N latitude, the average annual 
temperature in the Rookery Bay area is about 24°C (75°F).  Winter temperatures range from 
-1°C (ca. 30°F) to about 26°C (75°F), with cooler days and nights (10-15°C) in the months 
of January and February.  Warming trends in April and May are frequently modified by 
blustery winds from the southwest off the Gulf of Mexico, and by late season cold fronts 
with northerly breezes.  Summer high temperatures approach 35°C (95°F) or higher on 
occasion (Thomas 1974).

Rookery Bay and vicinity have an annual rainfall of 50-55 inches (127-140cm) per year 
(Thomas 1974).  The heaviest average monthly rainfall, 8-9 inches per month, occurs from 
June through September.  Lowest average rainfall, 1-2 inches per month, occurs from 
November through March.  Approximately 66% of the total yearly rainfall occurs between 
the months of June and October.  Southwest Florida lies in the seasonal tropical weather 
belt that channels hurricanes toward or along the coast.  Historically, the area is 
fortunate in that few severe hurricanes have come ashore.

The weather station is located at Rookery Bay's lab facilities with the Wind Sentry, 
Temperature and Humidity sensor, Barometric Sensor and LiCor sensor all located on the 
approximately 6m aluminum tower following the descriptions outlined in the CDMO Manual V 
4.0.  The Tipping Bucket Rain gauge is located to the east away from the tower on the 
roof of the lab building.  The sensors were wired to the CR10X following the protocol in 
the CDMO Manual.  


6) Data collection period

Weather data has been collected at the Henderson Creek site since 1996.  The current SWMP 
weather station has been fully operational since September 19, 2001. 

7) Distribution

8) Associated researchers and projects

The NERR Water Quality Monitoring Project also has a station located on Henderson Creek.  
The principal objective of this study is to record long-term water quality data for 
Rookery Bay in order to observe any physical changes or trends in water quality over 
time.  Four sites were chosen, one reference nearly pristine location, Fakahatchee Bay, 
and three other sites representing various degrees of watershed hydrologic alteration.  
Relative to historic freshwater flows into these estuaries, Faka Union Bay receives far 
greater freshwater, Henderson creek receives less total freshwater but increased 
freshwater during the late rainy season and Blackwater River receives less total 
freshwater.  Measurements are taken every 30 minutes at the Henderson Creek, Blackwater 
River, Faka Union Bay and Fakahatchee Bay sites.  The loggers are deployed for two-week 
intervals before exchanged with a clean/calibrated instrument.

A long term fish survey is also done in Fakahatchee Bay, Faka Union Bay, Pumpkin Bay and 
the Henderson Creek site monthly.  Species present, species number and standard lengths 
are recorded at four randomly selected sites surrounding the water quality stations.  

Benthic macro-invertebrates are collected near oyster bars using Hester-Dendy collection 
devices at Fakahatchee Bay, Faka Union Bay, Blackwater River and Henderson Creek 
locations.

13) Other remarks

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected with CR10X 
program versions prior to version 4.0 which was distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary 
in order to merge the old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen minutes 
(array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   
Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   
the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been abandoned.  
Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 
of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.
