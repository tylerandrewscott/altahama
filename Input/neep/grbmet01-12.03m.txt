2) Entry verification 
After the data are downloaded from the weather station, it is imported into the 
SWMP Weather Data Management Program. The data are QA/QC'd by the WDMP which 
generates an error report. The erroneous data are then examined and corrected or 
deleted using Microsoft Access. After the monthly file has been corrected in 
Access, it is recompiled in WDMP.


a) Data Input Procedures:

The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour data were downloaded from each 
instrument on the weather station to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger.  
The CDMO Data Logger Program (nerr.csi) was loaded into the CR10X and controls 
the sensors and data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification 
section for the data collection schedule).  The weather station is permanently 
connected to a Dell computer in the lab.  The data were downloaded twice monthly 
to the PC.  The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W software supplied by 
Campbell Scientific.  

The following are common errors that occur in the data sets.  Values are flagged 
by the WDMP program if, wind speed falls below the 0.5 m/s criteria, or a 
temperature change of greater than 3 C in a 15-minute period or a precipitation 
difference of greater than 5mm in 15 minutes occurs.

Once an entire month of data were available, the CDMO Weather Data Management 
Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an Access database.  This 
program was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data 
collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule).  The WDMP will automatically input and convert the monthly 
raw data file into and Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP 
performs.  First, it converts the comma delimited 
monthly raw data file into an Access Database.  Secondly, it checks the data 
against a predetermined set of error criteria (see Part C of this section).  
Finally, it produces error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were 
investigated and are noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data 
corrections that were performed are noted in the Data Correction section below.  

The new Data Logger Program (NERR_4.CSI) was loaded into the CR10X on November 
24, 2003 at 930. The raw file data collected after November 24 at 930 was 
exported from PC208W in a comma-delimited format (.DAT file) and opened in 
Microsoft Excel for pre-processing with the EQWin format macro that was 
developed by the CDMO to reformat the header columns, insert station codes, 
insert a corrected time column and allow the technician to remove any pre- and 
post-deployment data from the file. The pre-processed file is then ready to be 
copied into the EQWin water.eqi file where the data are QA/QC checked and 
archived in a database.  EQwin now replaces the WDMP as the NERR MET primary 
QA/QC program. EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover data set 
outliers (values which fall outside the range that the instrument is designed to 
measure) and large changes in the data.  EQWin is also used to generate 
statistics, view graphs, create customized queries and reports of the data, 
cross query the water, weather and nutrient data and finally export the data to 
the CDMO.  Any errors or anomalous data are noted and further examined and 
either deleted or noted in the metadata. Research Technician Jaimie Wolf error 
checked and compiled the 2003 Weather data.
 
The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data collected 
with CR10X program versions prior to NERR_4.CSI (version 4.0) which was 
distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the old data 
format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0 (3 array 
output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums every fifteen 
minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day (array 144) for any 
sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 and 151 fifteen minute 
data were converted to the new 15 array;   the hourly 101, 102, 105 and 106 data 
were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 243, 244, 245 and 
246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, the use of 
55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing data has been 
abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP weather data 
collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed and left blank.  

b) Data Collection Schedule

i) 15-minute data are collected instantaneously for Air Temperature (C), 
Relative Humidity (%), Barometric Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and 
Wind Direction (degrees).  15-minute Precipitation (mm) and PAR 
(mmol/m^2) data are totaled from 5-second readings, prior to NERR_4.CSI
ii) 15-minute average, maximum and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb) and Wind Speed (m/s) with NERR_4.CSI.
iii) Hourly average, maximum, and minimum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Hourly 
totals for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute 
readings.
iv) Daily average, maximum and minumum data are averages of 5-second 
readings for Air Temperature (oC), Relative Humidity (%), Barometric 
Pressure (mb), Wind Speed (m/s), and Wind Direction (degrees).  Daily totals 
for PAR (mmol/m^2) and Precipitation (mm) are totals of 15-minute readings.

Data were stored on a Campbell Scientific storage module (SM192 or SM4M), which 
were retrieved monthly.  The data were downloaded and pre-processed as described 
in Section 2.  QA/QC of the data was conducted using either the WDMP or EQWin.

3) Research objectives:

The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological data at the Great 
Bay Estuary in order to aid with the interpretation of changes in water quality.

4) Research methods:

The Campbell Scientific weatherstation samples every 5 seconds to produce both 
hourly and daily averages of those measurements of air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.  A two-
week sampling interval was chosen so that the CR10X datalogger would not run out 
of memory and overwrite data. Periodically, sensors on the weatherstation are 
inspected for damage or debris.  If any is found, it is repaired and/or cleaned. 
Sensors are removed and sent back to Campbell Scientific for calibration at 
minimum of every three years. 

5) Site location and character:

The GBNERR weather station is located on the roof of the University of New 
Hampshire's Jackson Estuarine Laboratory.  The lab is located on the shore of 
the Great Bay Estuary at Adams Point, which divides the Little Bay and Great Bay 
portions of the Estuary.   The latitude and Longitude are as follows: N 43º 
08.063 W 070º 54.576.  The approximate distance of the weather station is as 
follows:
From the 
	Great Bay sonde: 1 mile
	Squamscott River sonde: 2 miles
	Lamprey River sonde: 2.5 miles
	Oyster River sonde: 4 miles
	Portsmouth Harbor sonde: 6 miles

The rooftop at Jackson lab is approximately 30 ft above ground and approximately 
45 ft above mean high water.  The roof is tar with embedded light colored stones 
which provides a generally reflective surface that does not absorb and radiate 
excessive heat.  The CR10X datalogger, air temperature and relative humidity 
sensors are attached to the lower portion a three-meter tower mounted on the 
roof.  The rain gauge is affixed to a gable that rises approximately 3' above 
the roof line.  The light sensor and wind speed and direction sensors are 
attached at either end of a "T " mounted on top of the tower.  There is minimal 
blocking and shading due to the mounting height 
of the instruments.  


6) Data collection period:

Weather data has been collected at the Great Bay site since April 1997.
This metadata document covers the period of time from January 1, 2003 to 
December 31, 2003.

7) Distribution

8) Associated researchers and projects:

The weather data are used by a number of University and State agency scientists 
conducting biological, physical and chemical projects in the estuarine and near 
shore environments.  The data are used by the SWMP program to assist in the 
interpretation of short and long term changes in water column conditions.  Some 
general examples include 1) using rainfall data to understand changes in 
salinity, 2) using wind speed and direction to understand changes in turbidity 
and 3) using PAR data to understand changes in fluorescence and chlorophyll a 
concentrations.

Examples of other projects and researchers that use the data are:

1.  Microbial source tracking and microbial pollution source identification 
studies by Dr. Steven Jones at UNH (rainfall data)
1.  Sediment resuspension and transport studies by Dr. Larry Ward at UNH (wind 
speed and direction)
2.  Eel grass modeling by Dr. Fred Short at UNH (light data)

13. Other remarks

LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an 
incorrect multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because 
these values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all 
valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these 
values are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid 
data points.
