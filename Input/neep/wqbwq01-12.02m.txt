2)	Entry verification:

		The data are uploaded in three file formats (each to separate files 
identified with the same file name but with unique extensions) from the YSI 6000 
and 6600 data loggers to a PC with the YSI 6000 and 6600 EcoWatch software.  Two 
of these (PC6000 and ASCII text formats) are kept on file in the WBNERR archive.  
The comma delimited format data file (.csv) is imported to the EXCEL spreadsheet 
program (version 5.0) where it is processed according to standard NERRS CDMO 
protocol using the CDMO Excel 5.0 macros.  File size of one complete month of 
data each has been achieved by concatenating (and truncating if necessary) 
shorter files of interrupted data segments.  File contents initially are 
examined for anomalies (e.g., sensor malfunction, battery failure, spurious 
values, etc.) by visualization of data with the Ecowatch Software provided by 
YSI.  The data is also graphed using the Excel program for each two-week 
deployment of raw data. Data requiring editing are noted and copies of the 
graphs of raw data are saved at WBNERR.  Data editing to CDMO protocol is 
conducted in Excel.  Missing data (data logger malfunction or maintenance 
periods) are represented by periods (".").  Outliers (data values not within the 
design range of the respective sensors except for turbidity and depth) are 
changed to periods.  Data values recorded during deployment or retrieval (i.e., 
when the instrument was out of the water or in the laboratory) are deleted or 
replaced with periods.  A record of changes is documented in the Data Anomalies 
section of the metadata file. The monthly files are sent electronically by FTP 
to CDMO.  
		The CDMO cdmomac3.xls will allow the user to automatically format 
column widths to the correct number of decimal places based on YSI sensor 
specifications.  It also allows the user to QA/QC each data logger generated 
file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not contain data with 
periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range of what the data 
logger is designed to measure (i.e. outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro will 
allow PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly Excel 
file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data.  In 
addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro 
allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis.  Copies of all files are retained at the Reserve.  During 
Deployment Year 2002, the Research Assistant, Kelly Chapman, performed all 
instrument calibration and maintenance and data management.

3)	Research objectives:

For the NERR System-Wide Monitoring Program (SWMP), the YSI data loggers are 
programmed to record water quality parameters every 30 minutes. A total of four 
SWMP sites were located in the Waquoit Bay estuarine system during 2002. These 
four are: 1) Metoxit Point (MP), which is the oldest actively monitored site 
(since 1998), is located in the middle of Waquoit Bay's main basin; 2) 
Menauhant (MH), in operation since March 2001, is located adjacent to Eel Pond 
Inlet on Vineyard Sound - one of the two tidal inlets into the Waquoit Bay 
estuary; 3) Child's River (CR), in operation since May 2002, located near the 
head of the tidal section of Child's River- one of the two main surface fresh 
water sources to Waquoit Bay; and 4) Sage Lot (SL), in operation since May 2002, 
located in Sage Lot Pond-a relatively pristine tidal pond surrounded by salt 
marsh and barrier beach, possessing one of the bay's few remaining eelgrass 
stands.  The main purpose of water quality monitoring program is to aid Waquoit 
Bay NERR in one of its priority missions: to perform as a living laboratory and 
platform for coastal and estuarine research. The long term, continuous detailed 
monitoring of the estuary's basic hydrophysical parameters is an essential tool 
and context for any research activities located here. Besides this overarching 
mission, there are also several specific research interests.  One primary issue 
for the Waquoit Bay ecosystem is the influence of anthropogenic induced 
alterations by nitrogen enrichment.  Waquoit Bay receives nitrogen from several 
sources, such as septic systems (their leachate percolates into groundwater 
which then enters the bay), run off from roads, run off containing domestic and 
agricultural fertilizer and animal waste, and atmospheric sources. This elevated 
nitrogen loading to the bay has resulted in enhanced eutrophication that has 
contributed to the alteration of the bay's habitats.  For example, thick mats of 
seaweeds (macroaglae) now cover the bottom where eelgrass meadows thrived in the 
1970's.  Unfortunately, there are few definitive records of the bay's water 
quality conditions during that period, which makes it difficult to evaluate the 
rates of change.  To facilitate future evaluation, long-term records from SWMP 
can be used to track water column conditions.  Of particular interest, in this 
regard are measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, dissolved nitrogen 
and chlorophyll concentration.  Such records will facilitate evaluation of 
changes which may come about from a continuation of watershed alteration that 
result from current development patterns  (i.e., non-sewered residential areas 
served by private septic systems typically consisting of septic tanks and leach 
fields) as well as non-industrial commercial development, such as golf courses, 
cranberry bogs, and retail shopping outlets.  The records will be useful for 
evaluating the efficacy of remediation efforts intended to reduce the nitrogen 
loading from these sources to Waquoit Bay.
		Another focus of long-term research interest is the detection of 
climate change and the determination of its effects on the estuarine 
environment.  Characterizing the variability of the various water column 
parameters, such as their scale, magnitude and frequency, is likely to be an 
important aspect of the estuarine ecosystem that may be sensitive to climate 
change. Related to this focus is an interest in the impact of storms 
(hurricanes and northeasters) and other extreme meteorological events on the 
estuary. For example, what temperature and wind field thresholds exist that 
might bring about or trigger certain conditions within the bay?  The 
observations recorded by the SWMP will allow for these types of studies.      

4)	Research methods:

YSI 6000 and 6600 series sondes are deployed at each permanent water quality 
monitoring station at the Waquoit Bay Reserve. Since in-situ instrumentation can 
only record conditions at a specific location, permanent monitoring stations for 
SWMP are chosen to be in some way representative of the overall estuary. 
This is difficult in practice since estuaries by their very definition are 
coastal regions where large physical, chemical and biological variations tend to 
occur in space and time, so that often no particular location within the system 
is "typical" of the overall system. Establishing a number of stations can 
overcome this problem somewhat, and as of 2002 we have established four 
permanent stations in the Waquoit Bay estuaries. This represents a doubling over 
the previous year. Our current SWMP stations are situated so as to be as 
representative as much as possible of the estuary and its inputs/outputs. 
Additional details concerning the station characteristics are discussed in the 
next section. 
		The YSI sondes measure and record ambient water temperature, 
specific conductivity (and calculate salinity), dissolved oxygen (mg/L and % 
saturated), turbidity (NTU), water level (m), and pH at 30 minute intervals 
during deployment periods extending for approximately two weeks. Note that the 
pressure sensors we currently use are unvented and so variations in atmospheric 
pressure are recorded as changes in water depth (atmospheric data are available 
from our SWMP meteorological station (as of 12/2001) and so it is possible to 
make this correction to the depth data, for increased accuracy. Also, at our 
Metoxit Point site, since 12/2000, we have been using a YSI chlorophyll 6025 
sensor and these data are available by contacting us directly at the reserve 
(and included in the raw files for this year's SWMP data set for CDMO).
		Sondes are deployed and retrieved approximately every two weeks. The 
"old" sonde is retrieved and a "new" replacement sonde is deployed immediately 
so that ideally no record gap occurs. The two week deployment duration is 
constrained by a combination of battery life (shorter life in colder waters) and 
fouling of the DO sensor (and other sensors to a lesser degree) during the warm 
summer months. Prior to deployment (within 24 hrs), each instrument is checked 
and its sensors re-calibrated using standard YSI (Operating Manual) protocols. 
Similarly, after a deployment, each sonde is brought back to the laboratory for 
a post-deployment check, data downloading, instrument and sensor cleaning. 
Salinity sensors are calibrated with reference seawater that had been previously 
analyzed with a Guildline salinometer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic 
Institution (David Wellwood is the technician for this instrument).  pH sensors 
are calibrated with 7.0 and 10.0 pH standard solutions (2-point calibrations). 
The turbidity standard used was Hach 100 NTU, and distilled water (DI) for 0 
NTU. Temperature sensors were not calibrated.  Oxygen sensor membranes were 
inspected before and after each deployment.  Oxygen sensor membranes were 
replaced 24 hours prior to each deployment when the sensor seemed to need 
reconditioning. Final DO calibration was not done until the membrane had been in 
place for at least 8 hours. As another check on instrument performance, in-situ 
measurements of air and water temperature, DO, salinity, water temperature, and 
pH are made using a hand-held YSI 650 at deployment/retrieval times. In 2002, 
SWMP data were collected at the Metoxit Point and Menauhant sites from January 1 
through December 31, 2002. No significant ice-over conditions occurred during 
the winter/spring of 2002. The two new sites, Child's River and Sage Lot, went 
on line in May 2002 as part of a NERRS-wide SWMP expansion, and continued 
operation into December. The Sage Lot site was shut-down in mid-December 2002 
due to ice-over in Sage Lot Pond exceeding 4" in thickness.  Two types of 
mooring silos are used to hold the sondes. The Metoxit Point and Sage Lot 
stations are located offshore and away from shore structures. The sonde moorings 
for these stations consist of a vertical PVC pipe tower (2" ID), about 1.5 
meters in height) extending from a 120 lb cast concrete base resting on the 
bottom. Attached to this tower is a 0.7 m PVC pipe section (4" ID), referred to 
as the silo, that holds the sonde and is adjustable for setting the depth of the 
sensor package. The sondes are lowered and inserted into the 4" PVC silo from 
the surface at low water, when the top of the tower is only about 0.3 m below 
the surface. The lower part of the silo section is perforated with numerous 1.5" 
holes to allow the YSI sonde's sensors direct exposure to the flow of ambient 
waters. The Metoxit Pointand Sage Lot silos are set so that the sensor package 
is 0.7 m and 0.5 off the bottom, respectively.  This ensures that the sensors 
are above the macro algal mats in the case of Metoxit Point, and sufficiently 
into the water column because of the thick eelgrass meadow in Sage Lot. The 
Menauhant and Child's River stations are shore-side locations and their moorings 
are a more typical type of silo - a single PVC section (4" ID) mounted 
vertically on a pier piling. The Menauhant site, located at a yacht club dock, 
is adjacent to a tidal inlet, and the Child's River site, located at commercial 
marina and boat yard, is adjacent to the upper reaches of a tidal river.  The 
base of the these silos are also ventilated with large holes (1.5" diameter) and 
their sensor packages (bottom of the sonde) are both mounted about 0.4 m off the 
bottom.   All mooring silos are painted with antifouling paint at the beginning 
of the spring season, and periodically checked and scrubbed during the summer 
season.
   

5)	Site location and character:

General description of Waquoit Bay estuarine system: 
		The Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve (WBNERR) is 
located in the northeastern United States on the southern coast of Cape Cod, 
Massachusetts.  About 8,000 people maintain permanent residency in Waquoit Bay's 
drainage area, which covers parts of the towns of Falmouth, Mashpee, and 
Sandwich. During summer months, the population swells 2-3 times with the 
greatest housing concentrations immediate to the coastline (water views and 
frontage). In addition, the upper portions of the watershed include a military 
base, Otis Air Force Base and the Massachusetts Military Reservation, portions 
of which have been designated by the EPA as Superfund sites due to past 
practices of dumping jet fuel and other volatile groundwater contaminants.  
   	WBNERR's estuaries are representative of shallow tidal lagoons that occur 
from Cape Cod to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. WBNERR is within the northern edge of 
the Virginian biogeographic province, on the transitional border (Cape Cod) with 
the Acadian biogeographic province to the north and east.
	Like many embayments located on glacial outwash plains, Waquoit Bay is 
shallow (< 5 m), fronted by prominent barrier beaches (i.e., those of South Cape 
Beach State Park and Washburn Island), and is backed by salt marshes and upland 
coastal forests of scrub pine and oak.  Two narrow, navigable inlets, reinforced 
with granite jetties, pass through two barrier beaches to connect Waquoit Bay 
with Vineyard Sound to the south.  A third shallow and generally un-navigable 
inlet opened through the Washburn Island barrier beach during Hurricane Bob in 
August 1991, finally closed up in February 2002. 
		Bottom sediments in the bay are organic rich silts and medium sands. 
Sediment cores taken in summer of 2002 indicate that the depth of these 
estuarine sediments is up to 9 m thick in places. Thick (up to 0.3 m) 
macroalgae (seaweed) mats overlie much of the bottom of the bay, and largely 
consist of species Cladophora vagabunda, Gracilaria tikvahiayae, and 
Enteromorpha. The dominant marsh vegetation in Waquoit Bay is Spartina 
alterniflora and Spartina patens. Dominant upland vegetation includes mixed 
forests of red oak, white oak, and pitch pine, and other shrubs and plants 
common to coastal New England. Land-use in the bay's watershed is about 60% 
natural vegetation, but the remaining land is largely residential housing, with 
some commercial (retail malls), and minor amounts of agriculture (~3%) 
(cranberry bogs).
		Dense housing developments cover the two peninsulas that form the 
western shore of the Waquoit Bay estuarine system.  Although the developments 
themselves are outside of the Reserve boundaries, dissolved nitrogen in 
discharges from their septic systems (via groundwater) and in fertilizer run-off 
from their lawns has significant effects on the functioning of the Waquoit Bay 
ecosystem. These impacts have been a primary subject of study at the Reserve 
since its designation (1988).  One outcome of this research has been the 
delineation of sub-watersheds within the overall drainage area for Waquoit Bay, 
of which WBNERR is a small part. This knowledge allows for the design of 
experiments based on the spatial variation of nutrient loading and other land-
use related impacts.
		At the northern end of the bay, an area comprising a separate sub-
watershed, coastal bluffs of glacial till rise 30 feet above sea level. The 
northern basin of the bay, just below these bluffs, is its deepest area 
(approximately 3 m MLW), while much of the remainder of the bay is about 1.5 m. 
Bourne, Bog, and Caleb Ponds are freshwater kettle hole ponds on the northern-
most shore of the bay.  As components of the same sub-watershed, they have a 
common albeit minor freshwater outflow into the bay's northern basin via a 
narrow channel through a brackish marsh. To the east and south, other sub-
watersheds surround several tidal and freshwater ponds, including Hamblin and 
Jehu Ponds, brackish salt ponds that are connected to the main bay by the tidal 
waters of Little and Great Rivers, respectively.  The shorelines of the ponds 
are developed with residences that are occupied both seasonally and year round. 
Hamblin Pond and Little River are components of one sub-watershed, and Jehu Pond 
and Great River are elements of a separate sub-watershed. Further south lies 
Sage Lot Pond. It is in the least developed sub-watershed and also contains a 
barrier beach and salt marsh ecosystem of the reserve's South Cape Beach State 
Park. To the east of Sage Lot Pond and within the same sub-watershed, lies the 
highly brackish Flat Pond. It receives minimal tidal flows of salt water from 
Sage Lot Pond through a narrow, excavated and culverted channel. The 
preponderance of the input to Flat Pond is groundwater and run off, both of 
which are likely affected (e.g., nutrients, pesticides, bacteria) by an adjacent 
golf course and near-by upper-scale residential development.
		The largest source of surface freshwater to Waquoit Bay is the 
Quashnet / Moonakis River.  Although named "river", this and Childs River are 
more appropriately described as "streams"  because of their small channels and 
discharge ~1.0 CFS.  A component of yet another sub-watershed, it originates in 
Johns Pond situated north of the bay and traverses forests, cranberry bogs, 
residential areas, and the Quashnet Valley Golf Course before entering the bay 
near the southern "boundary" of the northern basin. ("Quashnet" applies to that 
portion of the river within the town of Mashpee, and "Moonakis" refers to the 
brackish estuary at the river's mouth, lying in the town of Falmouth.  Quashnet 
will be used hereafter to refer to the entire river.)  The Quashnet River's 
tidal portion has sufficient numbers of coliform bacteria to cause it to be 
closed to shell fishing most of the time. The source(s) of this bacteria (human 
or avian) is unknown at this time.
 	The Childs River is the second largest input of surface freshwater to the 
bay.  A component of another sub-watershed, it runs through densely developed 
residential areas. The Childs River sub-watershed receives the highest nitrogen 
loading and is the largest nitrogen contributor to the Waquoit Bay system of all 
the sub-watersheds. In the upper tidal portions of the river we have 
consistently recorded the highest chlorophyll levels and the lowest dissolved 
oxygen readings of any region in the bay and so this location represents an end-
member for looking at anthropogenic inputs and impacts on the system.  Another, 
albeit smaller, source of freshwater is the discharge of Red Brook through 
brackish marshlands into Hamblin Pond.  Additional freshwater enters the bay 
elsewhere through groundwater seepage (perhaps up to 50% of all freshwater input 
into the bay), precipitation and the flows of smaller brooks. There is 
relatively little surface water runoff entering directly into the bay due to the 
high percolation rates of Cape Cod's coarse, sandy soils.
		Knowledge of the homo/heterogeneity of the water masses in Waquoit 
Bay was originally derived from measurements made by reserve staff and from data 
obtained by the reserve's volunteer water quality monitoring group, the Waquoit 
BayWatchers who have collected depth profiles of Waquoit Bay water quality 
since 1993. Subsequent research by reserve staff (including some numerical 
modeling by T. Isaji) has revealed that lateral mixing has considerable 
influence because tidal currents follow a general course through 
the bay. This results in an overall structure to horizontal patterns of water 
quality characteristics. The pattern it produces is a gyre in the central 
portion of the main bay whereby currents follow a generally counter-clockwise 
flow around a central area that exhibits reduced exchange with the remainder of 
the bay. The flushing rate within the gyre is diminished when compared with 
other more peripheral areas of the bay. The location of the gyre meanders 
slightly, apparently under the influence of tides and wind). Because of the 
shallow conditions, restricted tidal inlets, and low amplitude tidal forcing of 
Vineyard Sound here (tides are semi-diurnal with a range about 0.5 m) water 
levels in the bay are also strongly influenced by wind forcing. Southerly winds 
increase tidal heights and advance the phase of the flood and retard the phase 
of ebb (Northerly winds have the opposite effect). 

		The Metoxit Point station (MP) (41o  34.131' N 070o 31.294' W, 2.2 m 
deep) initiated in 1998, is located in the main basin of Waquoit Bay and was 
selected to be within or near the outer regions of the gyre (described above) 
and more or less represents "typical" water mass conditions and residence times 
for the bay. The location is at least a half mile from shore, well flushed by 
tides, and is in an area that is minimally disturbed by routine activities on 
the bay (e.g. boat traffic, shell fishing, etc.). Bottom sediments at the site 
are organic rich muds overlain by thick agal mats. The salinity at this 
location typically ranges anywhere from 28-33 ppt.  Turbidity throughout the 
year is typically low (<5 NTU), though base values are higher in the warmer 
months as phytoplankton levels increase.  Also, because of this site's fairly 
open exposure to the south (greatest fetch over the bay), we have observed that 
when sustained southerly winds are greater than about 20 kts, the Metoxit Point 
site experiences increased turbidity ranging up to 25 NTU and beyond (sediment 
suspension event).  
		The Menauhant station (MH) (41o 33.156' N 070o 32.912' W, 1.2 m 
deep), initiated in March 2001, is located within the Eel Pond Inlet at the 
Menauhant Yacht Club dock.  Eel Pond Inlet is the westernmost of the two main 
tidal inlets into the Waquoit Bay system. The site was chosen because it 
occupies one of the strategic locations for gauging the system's water mass 
characteristics. Entering waters represent the marine end-member while outflows 
represent the final product of estuarine water mass modification and export to 
shelf waters. The salinity typically ranges from 28 to 33 ppt.   The site also 
has easy walk-in access to a secure private pier 
that extends into the throat of the inlet.  Also, because of the turbulent tidal 
flow within the inlet, conditions are vertically well mixed, and the site can be 
maintained year round even through ice-over conditions in the rest of the bay.  
Bottom sediments at this site are clean sands and gravels with almost no 
attached bottom vegetation. Turbidity throughout the year is typically low (<5 
NTU), though base values are higher in the warmer months as phytoplankton 
levels increase.  Since inception, we have noted that strong south to 
southeast (onshore) winds tend to produce turbidity events, ranging up to 60 
NTU, at this site from the wave induced suspension of fine sediments and 
organic material in the upstream near-shore zone.  While we have found that 
these type of turbidity events are localized to windward near-shore areas in the 
bay, the transport of these sediments at inlet mouths during such times is 
perhaps a dominant sedimentation process within the estuarine system.  In other 
words while the choice of our location may be producing a localized signal in 
one of our measured parameters that signal may reflect key processes in the 
system at large.
		The Child's River station (CR) (41o 34.793' N 070o 31.854' W, 1.2 m 
deep), was initiated this year in May, is located on a dock piling at Edwards 
Boat Yard, a commercial marina near the upper tidal reaches of of Child's River- 
one of the two main surface fresh water sources to Waquoit Bay (see general 
description of Waquoit Bay watershed above). This location is very strongly 
stratified, characterized by a salt wedge with fresher river water overlying 
saline ocean water. Vertical salinity ranges can run from 0-10 ppm at the 
surface to more than 30 ppm  just 1 m below. The sonde sensors are usually 
well within the salt wedge portion of the water column, nonetheless this 
location is also our freshest SWMP site, and is at the opposite end of Child's 
River from the seaward Menauhant station.  Bottom sediments are fine organic 
rich muds. This location represents the most terrigenously and nthropogenically-
impacted SWMP site. Monthly water quality, collected near this location for the 
past decade, shows very high chlorophyll concentrations during the warmer months 
and more recent dissolved nutrient records show very high nutrient-loads. 
Turbidity during the colder months is typically low (<5 NTU), while base values 
ramp up higher in the warmer months as phytoplankton levels increase to some of 
the highest concentrations recorded in the Waquoit Bay system. Boat traffic at 
the marina likely leads to increased turbidity (spiking up to 40 NTU and 
greater) during the boating season as well. As this site is dockside at a 
private marina, general security is high along with easy access. The station is 
also serviceable year-round and usually not subject to seasonal shutdown due to 
ice over.    
		The Sage Lot station (SL) (41o 33.254' N 070o 30.612' W, 1.2 m 
deep), also was initiated this year in May, and is located in deeper portion of 
Sage Lot Pond - a small sub-estuary of Waquoit Bay (20 ha) surrounded by salt 
marsh and barrier beach. Its small watershed is the least developed of all of 
Waquoit Bay's sub-watersheds and Sage Lot Pond is considered to be its least 
impacted and most pristine sub-estuary.  Bottom sediments are organic rich muds. 
Sage Lot Pond possesses one of the few remaining eelgrass beds in the Waquoit 
Bay system. Indeed the Child's River and Sage Lot Pond sites are considered to 
represent opposite end-members of nutrient-loading and human-induced influence. 
Researchers often locate their experiments in these two locations to take 
advantage of this difference. Turbidity throughout the year is typically low 
(<5 NTU), with higher end base values  ranging up to 10 NTU.  However, Sage Lot 
Pond is hydrologically connected to an upstream brackish source --  Flat Pond - 
via a series of tidal creeks, drainage ditches and culverts. With this brackish 
input we see salinity readings from 20 to 32 ppt.  Flat Pond borders a country 
club and golf course and some concern exists for its impact on the water quality 
of Sage Lot Pond. 


6)	Data collection period:
Data loggers were deployed at the Metoxit Point (MP) and Menauhant Yacht Club 
(MH) sites on January 1, 2002.  Data loggers at the Child's River (CR) were 
first deployed on May 29, 2002 and at Sage Lot (S) on May 16, 2002. All 
stations, with the exception of Sage Lot, were in operation from these dates 
through the end of December.  All monitoring is considered long-term.  
Deployment dates and times for 2002 are indicated below:

11)	 Data anomalies:

SMALL NEGATIVE TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: Slight negative turbidity values sometimes 
occur as a result of small calibration offsets. Often these turbidity minimum 
values are between 0 and -2 NTU. In May of this year we installed new model 
turbidity probes (YSI 6136) on our 6600 YSI data loggers. Due to the larger 
sampling depth of these new probes, larger calibration offsets occurred 
resulting in somewhat lower negative turbidity values (e.g., -2 to -14 NTU). 
Improvement in our calibration methods corrected this larger offset problem 
later in the year. All of these small negative turbidity values (the minimum for 
a given deployment) should be considered to be within 2 NTU of the true datum 
for correction purposes. Consequently, we have not deleted any of these small 
negative turbidity data. 

BIOLOGICAL-RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: This type anomaly includes turbidity 
readings that are either outside of the normal range or spikes way above 
background and unrelated to increased sediment suspension or decreased water 
column clarity. We believe these records are real (and not sensor malfunction), 
though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These extreme values 
are likely due to biological factors (such as small fish, crabs, or other marine 
organisms). Our criteria for flagging these data are single spikes (above rather 
constant background) over 50NTU that are more than 10 times surrounding values. 
These readings were deleted.

SUSPENSION EVENT RELATED TURBIDITY ANOMALIES: This type of anomaly includes 
turbidity readings that were either outside the normal range, or spikes way 
above background that are related to elevated turbidity levels indicative of 
wind wave related suspension events. We believe these are real (and not sensor 
malfunction), though not reflective of actual water column turbidity.  These 
extreme values are likely due to large floating particles (i.e., seaweeds, 
detritus, etc.) suspended in the water column during storm  events usually from 
strong southerly winds in the Waquoit Bay area. (see end of section 5 for more 
detail on these events at this site). Our criteria for flagging these data are 
values over 100NTU that are more than 5 times the magnitude of surrounding 
values, and linked to high winds.  These readings were deleted.

 

January 2002
Metoxit Point:

a)	The data logger stopped logging as of 01/15/2002 4:30 to 01/16/2002 8:30 
due to battery failure.

01/22/2002	09:30:00

c) Depth is zero on 01/14/2002 at 04:00:00. This is likely due to a combination 
of extremely low tides and meteorological conditions causing the probe either to 
be out of the water and/or appearing so as to low atmospheric pressure.  The 
depth data point was not deleted

Sage Lot:
a)	Small negative turbidity values related to calibration offsets were 
recorded this month. See note at the beginning of this section for further 
explanation.

b)	Specific conductivity and salinity data were deleted from 07/06/2002 
00:00:00 to 07/12/2002 08:30:00 due to anomalous behavior of the conductivity 
probe.  Salinity shows a very regular downward drift of about 8 ppm over this 
period. Cause is unknown, but a similar phenomenon was noted at Menauhant in 
August and a barnacle was found growing on the probe near the port. Though 
salinity affects the algorithms for depth, DO, and pH we have not deleted these 
data.
