2.   Entry Verification:

	The CDMO cdmomac3.xls macro is used to verify all water quality data.  
This macro allows the user to automatically format column widths to the correct 
number of decimal places based on YSI sensor specifications.  The macro also 
allows the user to QA/QC each datalogger generated file for missing data points, 
fill all cells that do not contain data with periods, and find all data points 
that fall outside the range of what the datalogger is designed to measure 
(outliers).  The CDMO import.xls macro allows PC users with 30-minute data to 
automatically create a monthly Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert 
periods for missing data.  Periods were later removed for data dissemination 
purposes and left blank.  In November 1999, graphing capabilities were added to 
this macro allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point 
graphs on a monthly basis.  Questionable data are either deleted or identified 
in section II.10.
	Persons responsible for data verification are the Research Coordinator and 
Research Assistant.

3.   Research Objectives:

	The objective of this study is to monitor surface water quality at the 
Tivoli Bays component of the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve 
(NERR).  Two tidal freshwater wetlands, Tivoli North Bay and Tivoli South Bay, 
and their primary upland tributaries, Stony Creek and Saw Kill Creek 
respectively, are monitored using four dataloggers (YSI 6600 sondes).  In Tivoli 
North Bay and Tivoli South Bay the dataloggers monitor the ebbing and flooding 
Hudson River water.  In Stony Creek and Saw Kill Creek, the dataloggers are 
deployed above the area of tidal influence and monitor the quality of water 
entering the Tivoli Bays via stream flow.  Thus, the relative importance of 
stream flow and tidal exchange and the potential impacts of intertidal areas 
on the water quality of the Tivoli Bays can be determined.  
	Monitoring the water quality of the tributaries is important because it 
has previously been determined that urban and residential land use practices are 
markedly influencing the water chemistry of the tributaries, especially Saw Kill 
Creek.  Since residential coverage continues to increase, we hope that the 
intensive monitoring of the surface waters in these watersheds will identify 
trends associated with this rapid development.  Examining the influence of tidal 
exchange allows identification of long-term trends in the water quality of the 
Hudson River Estuary at this location and the potential inputs to the Estuary 
from the Tivoli Bays.  Finally, the influence of intertidal areas on water 
quality within the Tivoli Bays is interesting because of the potential impacts 
of both floating and emergent invasive plant species present in this system.

4.   Research Methods:  

	Four YSI 6600 dataloggers are deployed at the Tivoli Bays component site 
of the Hudson River NERR.  The instruments in Saw Kill Creek and Tivoli South 
Bay are deployed 0.5 meters off the bottom in perforated PVC tubes that are 
vertically mounted to existing concrete structures.  These instruments use a 
depth sensor that is vented to the atmosphere for more precise depth readings.  
A YSI 6600 Extended Deployment System (EDS) sonde is utilized at Tivoli South 
Bay, this instrument differs from the other instruments in that it has a central 
wiper that wipes the surfaces of all probes to minimize fouling.  Non-vented 
instruments are deployed at Stony Creek and Tivoli North Bay in plastic coated, 
1/2 inch mesh, rectangular (24"x13"x13") cages. The bottom of each cage contains 
a 30 lb slab of poured concrete to prevent floating.  For deployments, the 
datalogger is strapped horizontally to the inside top of the cage with bungee 
cords and rests 0.25 meters off of the bottom of the cage.  At Stony Creek, the 
cage rests on the bottom of the creek under a bridge.  The cage is tethered with 
a cable and locked to an I-bolt on the bridge.  At Tivoli North Bay, the cage 
rests on the bottom, is secured to a piling, and an additional cable is attached 
to the top of the cage and anchored to the sediment.  
	Dataloggers are deployed from April through December of each year and data 
are collected at 30-minute intervals.  Each YSI 6600 datalogger measures depth, 
dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, salinity, pH, and turbidity.  Prior 
to deployment, calibration and maintenance are performed on each datalogger 
following the manufacturer's instructions (YSI Manual, sections 3,4, and 7 as 
well as the YSI 6-series operations manual).  Dissolved oxygen membranes are 
replaced and allowed to equilibrate for at least 24 hrs prior to deployment.  
Calibration standards are utilized for pH, turbidity, and conductivity.  These 
standards are purchased from a scientific supply company.  
	Individual instrument deployments last from two to four weeks. At the end 
of each deployment period, the dataloggers are swapped with newly calibrated 
instruments to avoid breaks in data collection.  At Tivoli South Bay, the EDS 
sonde is retrieved, maintenance and calibration are performed, and the sonde is 
re-deployed on the same day which results in a data gap of approximately 4 
hours.  After instruments are retrieved, calibration is checked against 
standards and the probes are serviced.  The data are uploaded to a desktop 
computer via cable. Graphs of each parameter are generated and examined 
immediately in order to identify significant problems or events that may have 
occurred during deployment. The data are then verified as described previously.


5.  Site Location and Character:

	The Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HUDNERR) is a multi-
component site totaling approximately 5,000 acres.  Each component of the 
reserve is referenced by River Mile (RM) of the Hudson River in New York State 
proceeding north from the southern tip of Manhattan (RM 0).  The reserve 
includes the following four component sites:  Piermont Marsh, Rockland County 
(RM 24)(41o02'30"N 73o54'15"W), Iona Island, Rockland County (RM 45)(41o18'15"N 
73o58'45"W), Tivoli Bays, Dutchess County (RM 98)(42o02'15"N 73o55'10"W), and 
Stockport Flats, Columbia County (RM 124)(42o02'30"N 73o46'00"W).  The four 
component sites include open water, tidal wetland, and adjacent upland buffer 
habitats and are representative of the diverse plant and animal communities that 
occupy the salinity gradient within the Hudson River Estuary.  Development 
within the watersheds of the four component sites ranges from predominantly 
urban/suburban to forested/agricultural.
	The highlighted component for this study is the Tivoli Bays in Annandale, 
NY.  This component includes four monitored sites: Tivoli South Bay, Tivoli 
North Bay, Saw Kill Creek and Stony Creek.  All four monitored sites are 
freshwater (0.0 ppt salinity).  Tivoli South Bay (latitude 42° 01' 37.336" N, 
longitude 73° 55' 33.445" W) is a tidal freshwater wetland with intertidal 
mudflats exposed at low tide.  During the growing season (June – September), the 
subtidal area of Tivoli South Bay is dominated by the invasive floating 
macrophyte Trapa natans.  Tivoli South Bay has a tidal range of 1.19 
meters and a soft, silt/clay bottom type.  The depth at the sampling location 
ranges from 0.5 to 2.5 meters.  The non-tidal freshwater input to Tivoli South 
Bay includes that of a large upland tributary and a few small perennial streams. 
Tivoli North Bay (latitude 42° 02' 11.56464" N, longitude 73° 55' 31.16645" W) 
is a freshwater tidal marsh with emergent marsh vegetation dominated by the 
cattail Typha angustifolia.  Tivoli North Bay has a tidal range of 1.19 meters, 
a soft, silt/clay bottom type, and a depth range from 0.5 to 3.0 meters at the 
sampling location.  The non-tidal freshwater input to Tivoli North Bay includes 
that of a large upland tributary and a few small perennial streams.
	Saw Kill Creek (latitude 42° 01' 01.543" N, longitude 73° 54' 53.589" W) 
is the main tributary flowing into Tivoli South Bay.  The Saw Kill Creek 
watershed is 26.6 square miles and land use within the watershed includes 
forested (51.1%), agricultural (25.8%), and urban (16.5%) areas.  Saw Kill 
Creek is non-tidal and freshwater input to this tributary consists of smaller 
creeks in the watershed.  At the sampling location Saw Kill Creek has a depth 
range of 0.5 to 2.0 meters, a discharge range of 2x10-5 to 1.2 m3/sec, and a 
rocky bottom type.  Stony Creek (latitude 42° 02' 45.556" N, longitude 73° 54' 
40.237" W) is the main tributary flowing into Tivoli North Bay. The Stony Creek 
watershed is approximately 23 square miles and is dominated by agricultural 
land use.  Like Saw Kill Creek, Stony Creek is non-tidal and freshwater input 
is via smaller creeks in the watershed.  Characteristics of Stony Creek at the 
sampling location include a solid rock bottom and a depth range of 0.5 to 1.5 
meters.  Stony Creek discharge is currently being determined. 
	The entire Hudson River system south of the Troy Dam is affected by 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and Tivoli North and South Bays have low 
sedimentary concentrations of PCBs.  Nutrient inputs to the Tivoli Bays via the 
non-tidal tributaries are the main concern in terms of pollutants. High 
concentrations of nitrate and phosphate have previously been documented in both 
Saw Kill Creek and Stony Creek.  Saw Kill Creek appears to be strongly 
influenced by residential land use practices. This highlights the importance of 
continued monitoring and identification of non-point sources of pollution at 
these sites. 

6.   Data collection period:

	YSI 6-series datalogger sampling at Saw Kill Creek (SK) and Tivoli South 
Bay (TS) began in May 1995.  Sampling at Tivoli North Bay (TN) began in July 
1996 but ceased in 1997-1998 due to instrument exposure at low tide. In 1999, an 
alternate site was established for TN and sampling began again in July of 1999.  
Sampling began at Stony Creek (SC) in April 2002.  Sampling is continuous from 
April through December but is not conducted from approximately mid-December 
through the end of March due to winter storms and ice on the Hudson River and 
the tributaries.  
	A YSI 6600 Extended Deplyment System (EDS) sonde was deployed at Tivoli 
South Bay starting on 04/08/2003.  The EDS differs from the other 6600 
nstruments in that a large wiper is positioned centrally to the probes and wipes 
them prior to every sample.  This wiper requires that the pH probe not have a 
guard over the glass bulb, and a new flat pH probe was deployed on the EDS 
starting 09/25/2003. Otherwise, the EDS sonde is identical to the other 6600 
dataloggers.

7.	Distribution
	NOAA Ocean and Coastal Resource Management Data Ownership and 
Dissemination Policy for the NERRS National Monitoring Program: 
	Data collected in conjunction with the National Estuarine Research 
Reserve System's (NERRS) National Monitoring Program is considered public 
information. The principle investigators (PIs) responsible for collecting data 
at each NERRS site must process the data using Estuarine Reserve Division (ERD) 
approved quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols. The PI has 
three (3) months from the date of data collection to process the data, and then 
three (3) months from the date of data processing to transmit the QA/QC 
processed data to ERD or an ERD approved Centralized Data Management Office 
(CDMO) in accordance with the standard rules for application to oceanographic 
data sets (NOAA Administrative Order  216-101). The schedule reflected below 
assumes an adequate and uninterrupted funding for the monitoring effort at each 
site, therefore the data processing and the transmission timetable may be 
adjusted accordingly. 
	Unpublished intellectual property owned and developed by the recipient 
with federal assistance funds, i.e., processed data, will not be officially 
disseminated to the public for a period of one (1) year from the date of  data 
processing. After one (1) year the QA/QC processed data will be made officially 
available to the general public on the Internet by the CDMO. However, if the 
data are requested pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the Government is 
required to release any data which are transferred to the Government by the 
recipient under the award. 
	An awardee may own a copyright on the publication of the processed data 
developed or bought under a Federal assistance award. The Federal awarding 
agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to 
reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for 
Federal government purposes, the copyright in any work developed under an award, 
or any rights of copyright purchased by an awardee with Federal assistance 
support (15 C.F.R. 24.34). Any such publication will include a notice 
identifying the award and recognizing the license rights of the government under 
this clause. This paragraph will have no force and effect for the processed data 
not published by the recipient. 

	NOAA/ERD retains the right to analyze, synthesize and publish summaries of 
the 
NERRS System-wide Monitoring Program data. The PI retains the right to be fully 
credited for having collected and processed the data. Following academic 
courtesy standards, the PI and NERR site where the data were collected will be 
contacted and fully acknowledged in any subsequent publications in which any 
part of the data is used. Manuscripts resulting from this NOAA/OCRM-supported 
research that are produced for publication in open literature, including 
refereed scientific journals, will acknowledge that the research was conducted 
under an award from the Estuarine Reserves Division, Office of Ocean and Coastal 
Resource Management, National Ocean Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration.  The data set enclosed within this package/transmission is only 
as good as the quality assurance and quality control procedures outlined by the 
enclosed metadata reporting statement.  The user bears all responsibility for 
its subsequent use/misuse in any further analyses or comparisons.  The 
Federal government does not assume liability to the Recipient or third persons, 
nor will the Federal government reimburse or indemnify the Recipient for its 
liability due to any losses resulting in any way from the use of this data. 

NERR water quality data and metadata can be obtained from the Research 
Coordinator at the individual NERR site (please see Section 2.2-1 Principal 
investigators and contact persons), from the Data Manager at the Centralized 
Data Management Office (please see personnel directory under the general 
information link on the CDMO home page) and online at the CDMO home page 
http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/.  Data are available in text tab-delimited format, 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format and comma-delimited format.   


8.   Associated researchers and projects:

	As part of the Hudson River NERR water quality monitoring project, 
physical and chemical constituents of the tributary waters discharging into 
HUDNERR marshes and marsh waters are measured monthly during ebb tides.  
Measurements include dissolved oxygen, seston, alkalinity, pH, temperature, 
salinity, conductivity and concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, 
sulfate and chloride.	
	Associated researchers working at the Tivoli Bays component site include 
scientists from the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, NY, Yale School 
of Forestry and Environmental Studies in New Haven, CT, and Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.

Upon retrieval of the sonde, the depth cable was frozen and depth was out of 
range for the post-deployment calibration check.  The following depth data were 
left in, but are suspect:

The sonde was pulled from the water for the rest of the year at 09:00:00 on 
12/05/2003 due to winter conditions.
 

12.  Missing Data 

	Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set. Periods were later 
removed for data dissemination purposes and left blank.  Data are missing due 
to equipment failure, maintenance/calibration of equipment, elimination of 
obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to calibration problems (both pre- 
and post-deployment).  For more details on deleted data, see the Anomalous Data 
(Section 10). Missing data are documented in this section.  If more details 
about missing data are required, contact the Research Coordinator at the site 
submitting the data.

14. Other Remarks

	A reference to negative and/or zero depth or depth readings flagged as 
outliers indicates that depth was recorded as a negative value in the raw data 
file and as zero in the edited data file due to the formatting of Excel. The 
technician edited none of these data points by hand nor did the technician 
delete any of them.

	If the post-deployment dissolved oxygen readings were out of the 
specification range (98%-102%), the data were carefully examined for obvious 
shifts in dissolved oxygen readings during deployment and readings at the end of 
deployment were checked against readings from the newly calibrated replacement 
sonde.  If there were no obvious discontinuities and the probe was functioning 
adequately, data are not considered suspect and the post-deployment readings 
were not mentioned in the Data anomalies section (Section 11) of the metadata.
