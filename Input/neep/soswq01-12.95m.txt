2.	Entry verification
The data are uploaded from the YSI-6000 data logger using the PC6000 software.  
Graphs are printed for an initial visual QA/QC check of the data.  Using the 
Export command, the .dat files are saved in the PC6000 software as .csv files.  
Files are then opened in EXCEL software and edited by removing headers, footers, 
and spaces.  Missing dates and times are inserted into the spreadsheet and 
missing data are denoted by periods (.).  Data files are then run through CDMO 
Excel 5.0 macros that: 1) add periods to cells with no data points; 2) check for 
outliers; 3) correct date and time intervals; 4) format the data columns to the 
CDMO standard.  The file is then printed out, and the data reviewed.  Data are 
deleted if they are clearly not possible given the specific site 
characteristics.  The data files are saved as Text (tab delimited) within the 
EXCEL software to be submitted to the CDMO via FTP.  John Roitz was in charge of 
data management from 12/98 through 6/99 and Sue Powell has been in that position 
from 9/99 to the present. 

3.	Research objectives
The South Slough NERR Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program is designed as 
a Before-After Control-Impact Study.  The YSI-6000 data loggers are deployed 
within the South Slough watershed along estuarine tidal channels immediately 
adjacent to intertidal salt marshes.  The first station  is located in the 
Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek) adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural marsh.  The second 
station serves as a non-point assessment site.  It is located in the Winchester 
Arm of the slough adjacent to a dike-removal/marsh restoration area (5.1 ha) and 
4.2 ha of natural marsh (Rumrill and Cornu 1995). The purpose of the research is 
to determine if the restoration activities change water quality parameters in a 
measurable way.

4.	Research methods
Measurements with YSI data loggers are taken every 30 minutes over 22-day 
periods at both stations.  Sonde cleaning and calibrations of the DO, 
conductivity, depth, pH and turbidity probes are performed as outlined in the 
YSI manual.  For conductivity and salinity calibrations, YSI conductivity 
calibrator solution 3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used without dilution.  For pH 
calibrations Corning pH 7 and 10 solutions are used, and for turbidity Hach 
turbidity standard is diluted to 100 NTU.  At deployment, the data loggers are 
lowered by chain into protective cases constructed from 4"-diameter ABS plumbing 
pipe that are affixed vertically on existing log pilings driven into the mud.  
Holes were drilled into the bottom section of pipe to ensure adequate tidal 
flushing and exposure of the sensors to ambient water conditions.  The sensor 
array is held 0.5 m off the bottom of the tidal channels that are approximately 
3 m deep.  The sondes are deployed and retrieved by skiff or sea kayak, and 
are out of the field for 24-60 hours for cleaning, data downloading, and 
calibration.  Post-deployment calibrations are performed immediately upon 
retrieval to determine if instrument drift has occurred.  No field calibrations 
are conducted. 

5.	Site location and character
South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-
Pacific portion of the Columbian bioregion, from Cape Mendocino, CA, north to 
the Columbia River estuary.  South Slough, located five miles southwest of Coos 
Bay, Oregon, is one of seven tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos 
estuary.  The two sites within the South Slough are being monitored with YSI 
data loggers are:

1) Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W]  
This station serves as a reference site and is located approximately 6.6 km from 
the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  It is adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural 
marsh. Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-33 ppt.  
Freshwater inputs have not been quantified. 

2) Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project):  
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 deg 19.216' W]
This station serves as a management-treatment site and is located approximately 
7.1 km from the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  The site is adjacent to the 
Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project, where dikes were removed from a 5.1 ha 
area in 1996 and 1998.  4.2 hectares of natural marsh surround the project site.  
Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-33 ppt. 
Freshwater inputs are between 1-23 cfs.   

Both sites are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to intertidal 
marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera marina).  
The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in channel 
width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel with regard to the 
predominant North-South winds.  The watershed above both sites is primarily 
second-growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial or residential 
sites in the watershed.

6.	Data collection period
	The water quality monitoring program was initiated in April 1995.  We 
collect data over a 14-22 day period.  Occasionally, it is necessary for the 
data collection period to be a few days longer or shorter.  In 1995, the 
collection dates were:

7.	Associated researchers and projects
The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State 
of Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the 
OR Department of Land Conservation and Development and the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality in July 1995.

(01:30), and Oct. 31 (01:30).  Other parameters do not show changes expected if 
meter was out of the water so data were not deleted.

Oct. 24 (15:30) to Oct. 31 (23:30):  The pH data were too low and were deleted.

May
May 01 (00:00) to May 03 (12:00):  Time stamp changed.  See Apr. 19 above.

May 02 (13:30) to (14:30):  High DO.  See Apr. 20 above.

May 28 (14:00) to May 31 (23:30):  pH was high, so may be a calibration error.  
No post-deployment data, but data were deleted as sensor drifted upward during 
deployment.

May 30 (05:00):  Low DO.

May 30 (12:30) to (19:00):  High DO began on flooding tide.

May 31 (05:00):  Low DO.

DO fluctuations are within limits for this site.

Jun. 12 (06:00) to (08:00):  Very low DO due to unknown causes.  Probe rebounds 
so data were not deleted.  No post-calibration data.

July
Jul. 27 (12:00) to Jul. 31 (23:30):  Large DO fluctuations are within limits for 
this site.

August
Aug. 01 (00:00) to Aug. 31 (23:30):  DO fluctuations – see Jul. 27 above.

Aug. 10 (22:00):  Very low DO due to unknown causes.  Probe rebounds so data 
were not deleted.  No post-calibration data.

Aug. 11 (16:00) to Aug. 28 (16:00): The pH data were too low, possibly due to 
calibration error and were deleted.

Aug. 28 (17:00) to Aug. 31 (23:30):  The pH data were too high, possibly due to 
calibration error and were deleted.

September
Sep. 01 (00:00) to Sep. 30 (23:30):  DO fluctuates from 29-160%.  Data are 
within limits for the site so were not deleted.

Sep. 01 (00:00) to Sep. 12 (14:30):  pH data - see Aug. 28 above.

Sep. 12 (15:00) to Sep. 26 (12:00):  The pH data were too low and were deleted.  
Depth data near zero on several occasions, but conductivity data was within 
limits for the site.

October
Oct. 01 (00:00) to Oct 31 (23:30):  DO fluctuates from 52.3-176.7%.  With tidal 
exchange, these data are within limits.  However, from Oct. 19 to Oct. 27, 
variability is reduced until meter is exchanged.

(15:00):  Salinity high, but possible for this site.

Oct. 27 (15:30) to Oct. 31 (23:30):  The pH data were too low and were deleted.  
Also, many negative depth readings may be a result of either calibration error 
or weather condition, as conductivity does not indicate that meter was out of 
the water.
