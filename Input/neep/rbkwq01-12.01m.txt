2. Entry verification.
	These data were directly downloaded from the YSI 6600 datasonde to the 
PC6000 software on a Dell Optiplex GX100.  The data were graphed and printed 
using the PC6000 software and then exported to Microsoft Excel.  Charting and 
plotting routines within PC6000 and Excel were used to verify the accuracy of 
the data.  In addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros provided by the CDMO were used to 
format and check the dataset for outliers beyond what the probes measure.  
Outliers and erroneous data were checked manually using the protocol defined in 
Appendix B of CDMO Operations Manual (v. 3.0). Finally, an additional screening 
protocol, designed by Mike Shirley was used to identify outliers based on site-
specific knowledge of expected parameter values. This protocol uses a Microsoft 
Excel template to flag "unusual" values to be examined more closely.  Values 
greater than or less than 1 standard deviation of historic values for this 
region are flagged as unusual. These outliers are eliminated only when the post-
calibration results or the values of manually recorded "spot" checks of the 
water quality measurements during datalogger retrieval indicate equipment 
malfunction.  Melissa Hennig and Vicki McGee, the water quality specialists, 
perform all data verification and screening.


3. Research objectives.

	Beginning January 1, 2001, two stations, Lower Henderson Creek and 
Middle Blackwater River were designated as the Reserve's permanent SWMP sites.  
Both stations log temperature, turbidity, SpCond, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen 
and depth at 30-minute intervals.   With the exception of turbidity, the dataset 
at these stations is nearly continuous beginning in April of 1996.  The dataset 
from these monitoring stations represents the longest record of continuous water 
quality measurements of all the Rookery Bay NERR water quality stations.

These two stations are in estuaries with watersheds having different patterns of 
landuse.  Their placement addresses priority resource management issues that are 
identified in the Reserve's management plan.  Specifically, the data from these 
stations are providing valuable information concerning the affects of landuse 
activities on the quantity, quality and timing of freshwater inflow into the 
Reserve.  

The Lower Henderson Creek station receives most of its freshwater from a canal 
system that drains a watershed area with approximately 50% developed versus 
natural landscape.  Landuse in the developed area is divided equally between 
residential and agricultural activities.  The Lower Blackwater River station 
receives a more natural pattern of freshwater inflow and has a watershed that 
has 75% natural landscape.  Agriculture predominates the land use activities 
within the developed area of Blackwater River watershed.  

A weir controls most of the freshwater flowing into Henderson Creek.  The 
Reserve has obtained grant funding to upgrade the existing weir structure to 
allow for a precise control of water release.  The dataset being obtained from 
the Lower Henderson Creek station, along with biological monitoring, is being 
used to develop a water release strategy for Henderson Creek.  The Lower 
Blackwater River station serves as a reference site to compare the influence of 
more natural seasonal fluctuations in salinity on estuarine species.

4. Research methods.
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific 
conductivity, turbidity and dissolved oxygen following the procedures outlined 
in the YSI Operating and Service Manual.  A two-point calibration is used for pH 
(Fisher buffers 7& 10) and turbidity (0 & 100 NTU from Advanced Polymer Systems, 
Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution (YSI conductivity calibrator) is used to calibrate 
specific conductivity.  Dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % saturation.  Sondes 
are deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 weeks time the 
fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling period 
is set for 30-minute intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the half-
hour).  The following physical water quality parameters are recorded: 
temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (mg/l), dissolved 
oxygen (% saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A post-deployment calibration 
is done after the sonde is taken out of the water using the same calibration 
protocol.  
 NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and the original data files are 
reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST). Both sondes are housed within 4-inch 
diameter, PVC pipes, which are attached to "aid-to-navigation" pilings.  The 
pipes are oriented vertically and are attached tightly with stainless steel hose 
clamps.  The bottom portion of the pipe is open and sits 6 inches above 
the bottom.  Probe readings are measured approximately 6-8 inches above the 
substrate.  Numerous 1-inch diameter holes are drilled circumferentially around 
the lowest 8 inches of the pipe to ensure adequate water flow around the probes.  
Sondes are hung by plastic coated steel chain inside the pipes; the chain is 
bolted to the piling.  A 'kryptonite' bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde 
inside the housing.
	The sondes are further protected from fouling by restricting the openings 
within the sonde guard with plastic screening. The plastic mesh (with 0.5-cm 
square holes) was attached on the outside of the sonde guards' circumference and 
on the inside of the sonde guards' Lowermost disk. Furthermore, the PVC is 
serviced on a minimum of a monthly basis.

5. Site location & character.
Site #1- Lower Henderson Creek (LH):
	The "Lower Henderson" site, site #1, is located at the mouth of Henderson 
Creek.  The piling (manatee caution sign) is located right of center (while 
facing downstream) of the creek channel, approximately 100 meters from RKB 
NERR's boat dock. The Lower Henderson Creek labeling is to clarify the site from 
other historical water quality stations.
Tides at Lower Henderson Creek are mixed and range from 0 m to 2.76 m 
(average 1.06 m).  The monitoring site is located in Upper Henderson Creek, 
approximately 5 km downstream of a four-lane highway (SR 951) that crosses the 
creek.  The creek is 5.8 km long (mainstream linear dimension), has an average 
mid-channel depth of approximately 2 m MHW, and an average width of 239 m.  At 
the sampling site, the depth is 2 m MHW and the width is 600 m.  This site is 
within the mesohaline region of the estuary, ranging between 5 and 18 ppt.  
Creek bottom habitats are predominantly fine sand and there is no bottom 
vegetation.  The dominant marsh vegetation near the sampling site is red 
mangrove.  The dominant natural vegetation of the watershed is hydric pine and 
cypress.  Upland land use 
near the sampling site includes residential areas with septic systems.  	
Watershed activities that potentially impact the site include non-point source 
pollution from road runoff, drift of mosquito control pesticides, runoff from 
upstream agricultural areas and leachate from nearby residential septic systems.  
The amount of water released from this weir can sometimes overwhelm natural 
tidal salinity patterns.  The historic Henderson Creek watershed is 
approximately 50% under public ownership and much of this protected area has 
intact cypress sloughs and other wetland vegetation.  Canals and water use for 
agriculture and human consumption have altered the hydroperiod of this 
watershed. Consequently, the Henderson watershed receives non-point source 
pollutant runoff from a variety of sources.

Site #2- Middle Blackwater River (MB):
	
	The Middle Blackwater River sonde, site #2, is located at the mouth of the 
river.  The sonde is affixed to navigational marker #17 within the river 
channel.  The Middle Blackwater River labeling is to clarify the site from other 
historical water quality stations.
	The substrate within the channel is a mixture of sand and silt with oyster 
shell matter mixed in.  Mature red mangrove forests dominate the banks of the 
river.  Upstream influences consist of Collier-Semonile State Parks boat basin 
and upstream agricultural fields, adjacent to Blackwater River's main feeder 
canal, SR 41 canal.  In addition, canals and roads built during the 1950's have 
caused significant disruptions to overland sheetflow reducing the amounts of 
freshwater flowing to this estuary.  Despite these alterations, the 
salinity fluctuations of this site suggest that seasonal fluctuations in 
salinity are more closely correlated to watershed rainfall patterns than 
salinities of estuaries with water control structures, such as Henderson Creek    
Blackwater salinities range from 0-40 ppt and fluctuate with the tides and 
watershed rainfall.  The tide range for Middle Blackwater River varies between 
0.2 and 1.8 meters.

deployed:
06/07/01 10:00 through 06/21/01 09:30

(c)	Turbidity.  Several high turbidity values were reported due to crabs being 
positioned over optics during readings.  These occurrences were deleted 
from the data set for the following dates/times:

06/27/01 13:30   100.2 NTU

(d)	Turbidity. Many (but not all) turbidity values were slightly negative 
and/or zero (possibly due to calibration error with 0 NTU standard), but were 
retained in the dataset for the following dates/times: 
06/01/01 4:30 through 06/07/01 09:30

(e)	All parameters.  All parameters were deleted because the sensors were 
exposed to the air due to extreme low tides for the following dates/times:
06/21/01 22:00 through 06/21/01 22:30
06/22/01 21:30 through 06/22/01 23:30

12. Missing data.

Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers, or elimination of data due to 
calibration probes (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
Anomalous Data Section (10).  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting data.

The water control structure (weir) located upstream from the Lower Henderson 
Creek station was altered on the following dates:

Gates Opened:				Gates closed:

West ditch gate  07/17/01		West ditch gate   11/08/01
		   
East ditch gate  07/23/01		East ditch gate   11/21/01

Main gate #2     07/24/01		Main gate #2      11/08/01



Extreme weather patterns affecting the water quality data occurred on the 
following dates.  In particular, depressed salinity and specific conductivity
levels were observed from July through November resulting from the heavy
tropical activity below: 

Weather Type/Name:			Duration of Effects:
Tropical Storm Barry			08/02/01 - 08/06/01
Tropical Storm Gabrielle		09/13/01 - 09/18/01
Large rain event				   09/27/01
Tropical Storm Iris			10/05/01 - 10/09/01
Hurricane Michelle			10/31/01 - 11/06/01 
(southeast of stations)

Between the months of July and December, several attempts were made to correct 
the improper deployment of the sonde in Lower Henderson Creek by lengthening the 
cable from which the sonde was suspended.  Depth values were observed during this
time period to be extremely low (0-0.8m) compared to the depth values of 0.3m 
to 1.6m observed for the rest of the year.  Finally, on 12/03/01  09:30 the PVC 
housing was replaced and depth values returned to normal.

Any time a reference is made to turbidity data being negative and/or zero, it 
was recorded as a negative in the raw data file and a zero in the edited data 
file due to the formatting of Excel. The technician edited none of these data 
points by hand nor did he/she delete any of them.
