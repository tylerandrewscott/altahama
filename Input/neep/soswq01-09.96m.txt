2.	Entry verification
The data are uploaded from the YSI-6000 data logger using the PC6000 software.  
Graphs are printed for an initial visual QA/QC check of the data.  Using the 
Export command, the .dat files are saved in the PC6000 software as .csv files.  
Files are then opened in EXCEL software and edited by removing headers, footers, 
and spaces.  Missing dates and times are inserted into the spreadsheet and 
missing data are denoted by periods (.).  Data files are then run through CDMO 
Excel 5.0 macros that:  1) add periods to cells with no data points; 2) check 
for outliers; 3) correct date and time intervals; and 4) format the data columns 
to the CDMO standard.  The file is then printed out, and the data reviewed.  
Data are deleted if they are clearly not possible given the specific site 
characteristics.  The data files are saved as Text (tab delimited) within 
the EXCEL software to be submitted to the CDMO via FTP.  John Roitz was in 
charge of data management from 12/98 through 6/99 and Sue Powell has been in 
that position from 9/99 to the present. 

3.	Research objectives
The South Slough NERR Estuarine Water Quality Monitoring Program is designed as 
a Before-After Control-Impact Study.  The YSI-6000 data loggers are deployed 
within the South Slough watershed along estuarine tidal channels immediately 
adjacent to intertidal salt marshes.  The first station serves a reference site 
and is located in the Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek) adjacent to 4.3 ha of 
natural marsh.  The second station serves as a non-point assessment management-
treatment site, and is located in the Winchester Arm of the slough adjacent to a 
dike-removal / marsh restoration area (5.1 ha) and 4.2 ha of natural marsh 
(Rumrill and Cornu, 1995).  The purpose of the research is to determine if the 
restoration activities change water quality parameters in a measurable way.

4.	Research methods
Measurements with YSI data loggers are taken every 30 minutes over approximately 
22-day periods at both stations.  Sonde cleaning and calibrations of the DO, 
conductivity, depth, pH and turbidity probes are performed as outlined in the 
YSI manual.  For conductivity and salinity, YSI conductivity calibrator solution 
3168 (10,000 uS/cm) is used without dilution.  For pH calibrations, Corning pH 7 
and 10 solutions are used, and for turbidity, Hach turbidity standard is diluted 
to 100 NTU.  At deployment, the data loggers are lowered by chain into 
protective cases constructed from 4"-diameter ABS plumbing pipe that are affixed 
vertically on existing log pilings driven into the mud.  Holes were drilled into 
the bottom section of pipe to ensure adequate tidal flushing and exposure of the 
probes to ambient water conditions.  The sensor arrays are held 0.5 m off the 
bottom of the tidal channels that are approximately 3 m deep.  The sondes are 
deployed and retrieved by skiff or sea kayak, and are out of the field for 24-60 
hours for cleaning, downloading and calibration.  Post-deployment calibrations 
are performed immediately upon retrieval to determine if instrument drift has 
occurred.  No field calibrations were conducted.

5.	Site location and character
South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve is representative of the mid-
Pacific portion of the Columbian bioregion, from Cape Mendocino, CA, north to 
the Columbia River estuary.  The South Slough, located five miles southwest of 
Coos Bay, Oregon, is one of seven tidal inlets that collectively form the Coos 
estuary.  The two sites within the South Slough that are being monitored with 
YSI data loggers are:

1)  Sengstacken Arm (Talbot Creek):  [43 deg 17.374' N, 124 deg 18.156' W]
This station serves as a reference site and is located approximately 6.6 km from 
the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  It is adjacent to 4.3 ha of natural 
marsh.  Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 0-33 
ppt.  Freshwater inputs have not been quantified. 

2)  Winchester Arm (Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project site):  
[43 deg 16.945' N, 124 deg 19.216' W]
This station serves as a management-treatment site and is located approximately 
7.1 km from the mouth of the South Slough estuary.  The site is adjacent to the 
Winchester Tidelands Restoration Project, where dikes were removed from a 5.1 ha 
area in 1996 and 1998.  There are 4.2 hectares of natural marsh surrounding the 
project site.  Tidal range is approximately 8 ft., and salinity ranges between 
0-33 ppt.  Freshwater inputs are between 1-23 cfs. 

Both sites are located in tidal channels immediately adjacent to intertidal 
marshes in habitats characterized by soft mud and eelgrass (Zostera marina).  
The primary contrasts between the two sites include differences in channel 
width, maximum channel depth, and orientation of the channel with regard to the 
predominant North-South winds.  The watershed above both sites is primarily 
second-growth coniferous forest, and there are no industrial or residential 
sites in the watershed.

6.	Data collection period
	The water quality monitoring program was initiated in April 1995.  We 
collect data over a 14-22-day period.  Occasionally, it is necessary for the 
data collection period to be a few days longer or shorter.  In 1996, the 
collection dates were:

7.	Associated researchers and projects
The SSNERR water quality monitoring project has been incorporated into the State 
of Oregon Coastal Non-Point Pollution Control Program (S. 6217) developed by the 
OR Department of Land Conservation and Development and the OR Department of 
Environmental Quality in July 1995.

Sep. 15 (13:00) to (14:30):  Very low DO – unknown reason.  Meter was in the 
water according to Specific Conductivity data, so data were not deleted.
