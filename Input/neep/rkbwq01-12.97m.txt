2. Entry verification.
	The data contained herein were directly downloaded from the YSI 6000 data 
sonde to the PC6000 software on a DOS-based 486 computer.  The data were 
immediately exported to Excel on a Macintosh PowerPC.  Charting and plotting routines 
within Excel and within Kaleidograph were used to verify the accuracy of the data.  In 
addition, the Excel 5.0 Macros provided by the CDMO were used to format and check the 
dataset for outliers beyond what the probes measure.  Outliers and erroneous data were 
also checked manually using the protocol defined in Appendix B of CDMO Operations 
Manual (v. 3.0).

3. Research objectives.
	Henderson Creek, the area in which both our data sondes are deployed, is the 
Reserve’s principal water conduit feeding the estuary and the Gulf of Mexico.  
Henderson’s watershed is almost entirely under public ownership, though historically 
much of its acreage was privately owned and developed.  Consequently, the Henderson 
system represents a restored watershed and estuary and serves as a management model 
for southwestern Florida.  For this reason, the Reserve is interested in long-term 
monitoring of its water quality.  In addition, we have begun a new research initiative 
which concerns the coastal linkages of processes and effects between estuaries and 
nearshore marine settings (just offshore in the Gulf of Mexico).  These two research 
purposes have dictated the placement of the two YSI data sondes.  The first sonde, which 
has been in place since early November, 1996, is located high within the estuary where 
salinities fluctuate drastically through tidal cycles and through seasonal changes in 
climate.  The second sonde was first deployed in mid-January, 1997 (delay was caused by 
a need to receive permission from the Coast Guard for its deployment on an “Aid-to-
Navigation” [ATON] marker).  It is located far downstream within the estuary, at the 
estuary’s mouth to the Gulf (Big Marco Pass). 

4. Research methods.
	Both sondes are housed within 4-inch diameter, PVC pipes which are attached to 
“aid-to-navigation” pilings.  The pipes are oriented vertically, hug the pilings, and are 
attached with stainless steel hose clamps.  The bottom portion of the pipe is open and sits 
6 inches above the bottom.  Probe tips are therefore taking measurements approximately 
6-8 inches above the substrate.  Numerous 1-inch diameter holes are drilled 
circumferentially around the lowest 8 inches of the pipe to ensure adequate water flow 
around the probes.  Sondes are hung by galvanized steel chain inside the pipes; the chain 
is bolted to the piling.  A ‘kryptonite’ bicycle lock is used to secure the sonde inside the 
housing.
	Beginning in March, the sonde deployed at Site #2 (Big Marco Pass) was further 
protected from fouling by restricting the openings within the sonde guard with plastic 
screening.  During the first couple of deployments at this site, arthropods (crabs & 
amphipods) and, in one case, a toad fish, took up residence within the sonde guard and 
undoubtedly interfered with the probes.  As a precaution, plastic mesh (with 0.5 cm 
square holes) was attached on the inside of the guard’s circumference and on the inside of 
the guard’s lowermost disk.  Small, plastic wire ties were used to secure the mesh.
	Prior to deployment, the sondes are calibrated for pH, specific conductivity, 
turbidity and dissolved oxygen following the procedures outlined in the YSI Operating 
and Service Manual.  A two point calibration is used for pH(Fisher buffers 7& 10) and 
turbidity(0 & 40 NTU from Advanced Polymer Systems, Inc.).  A 0.5M KCL solution is 
prepared to calibrate specific conductivity while dissolved oxygen is calibrated by % 
saturation.  Sondes are deployed for up to 2 weeks time. After approximately 2 weeks 
time the fouling on the probes becomes critical.  Sampling period is set for 30-minute 
intervals (readings are made every 30 minutes on the half hour).  The following physical 
water quality parameters are recorded:  temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, 
dissolved oxygen(mg/l), dissolved oxygen(% saturation), depth, pH and turbidity.  A 
post-deployment calibration is done after the sonde is taken out of the water using the 
same calibration protocol.  
In April, southwestern Florida switched from Eastern Standard Time (EST) to 
Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT).  NOTE:  All data within this metadata file and 
the original data files are reported in Eastern Standard Time (EST).

5. Site location & character.
	RKB’s monitoring sites are located at the up- and downstream ends of Henderson 
Creek, the principal estuarine system within the Reserve.
	The “Upper Henderson” site is located on the upper region of Henderson Creek.  
The piling is located right of center (while facing downstream) of the creek channel, 
approximately 50 meters downstream of State Hwy 951’s crossing of Henderson Creek.
	UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone 17, datum NAD-27):
		E429855.23
		N2881137.96
	Lat/Long:	
		26° 02’ 56.46587” N
		81° 42’  4.21595” W
	This segment of Henderson Creek is bordered by red mangrove forest.  A 
residential area, consisting of trailer parks, is located immediately upstream.  These may 
be delivering point-source pollutants.
	The substrate within the channel is composed of organic-rich, black mud.  The 
water depth varies between 0.5 and 1.5 meters, depending on the state of the tide.  
Salinities fluctuate daily with the tides and seasonally with rainfall.  For the months of 
November and December, 1996, salinities varied between 15 - 32 ppt.
	The “Big Marco Pass” site’s sonde housing is affixed to ATON day marker #2 at 
the confluence of Calhoun Channel and Isle of Capris Pass, just inshore of Big Marco 
Pass (for whom the locality is named).  Waters leaving the estuaries from both the 
Calhoun and Isle of Capris passes are consequently sampled by this sonde; waters 
traveling within Johnson Bay and Henderson Creek are represented.  ATON marker #2 is 
positioned on the south edge of the intracoastal waterway canal.  A housing development 
on Isle of Capris is located nearby to the south; the northern edge is lipped by red 
mangrove islands.
	UTM GPS coordinates (using UTM zone 17, datum NAD-27):
		E426177		
		N2873406
	Lat/Long:
		25° 58’ 44.47” N
		81° 44’ 15.00” W
	The substrate within the channel is composed of quartz sand.  Swift tidal currents 
travel through the channel, but a healthy epibenthos is supported (including, but not 
limited to, sponges, ascidians, crabs, and amphipods).  Salinities here are marine (33-35 
ppt); there appears to be little freshwater influence.  Depth ranges from 1.2 - 2.3 m, 
depending upon the state of the tide.
	To reference these sites on a nautical chart, see NOAA chart #11430 – “Lostmans 
River to Wiggens Pass”.

6. Data collection period.

7. Associated researchers & projects.
	Dr. Mike Shirley (at RKBNERR - email: shirley_m@dep.state.fl.us) has a 
telemetered YSI 600 monitoring station recording the same physical water quality 
parameters (minus turbidity) at a site downstream from the Upper Henderson Creek site.  
This unit is deployed, serviced and calibrated using different protocols.  These data are 
also available upon request.

throughout this month of data are considered suspect.  These observations will 
remain in the database until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #1: Upper Henderson Creek, August 1997:
(a) Dissolved Oxygen.  DO values from 08/20-09/04 dropped to negative values 
soon after deployment and remained low throughout the deployment(possibly 
due to fouling).   All DO values were considered suspect and deleted from the 
dataset for the following dates/times:
08/20/97  13:30 through 08/31/97  23:30

data are considered suspect.  These observations will remain in the database 
until a decision is made on how to deal with such data. Negative turbidity 
values were recorded for the following dates/times:
		12/10/97  11:00

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, January 1997:
(a) Turbidity.   Negative values for turbidity observed throughout this month of 
data are considered suspect.  These observations will remain in the database 
until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, February 1997:
(a) Dissolved oxygen.  DO values were out of range(>500% or negative) due to 
membrane damage and were deleted from the dataset for the following 
dates/times:
02/04/97  15:30 through 02/12/97 13:30

(b) Salinity.  On 02/05, salinity and specific conductivity fluctuated widely, at 
times with salinities > 50 ppt.  Salinity and specific conductivity data were 
deleted from the dataset for the following dates/times:
02/05/97  05:00 through 02/12/97  13:30

(c)	Dissolved oxygen.  The DO probe used during this deployment was later 
found to be malfunctioning.  Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from the 
dataset for the following dates/times:
		02/21/97  15:30 through 02/28/97  23:30
		
(d) Turbidity.  Negative and high(>1000 NTU) values for turbidity observed 
throughout this month of data are considered suspect.  These observations will 
remain in the database until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, March 1997:
(a)	Dissolved oxygen.  The DO probe used during this deployment was later 
found to be malfunctioning.  Dissolved oxygen values were deleted from the 
dataset for the following dates/times:
03/01/97  00:00 hours through 03/07/97  12:00
		
(b)	Dissolved oxygen.  In late March, unusually high DO values were recorded, 
beginning with values near 400% and gradually decreasing to 190%.  
However, values did predictably oscillate between minima and maxima in 
concert with tidal cyclicity.  The DO maxima progressively decreased through 
time despite the oscillation and eventually asymptoted out at values near 
200%.  Pre- and post-calibrations and pre- and post-deployment DO charges 
were normal, and the membrane was undamaged at time of sonde retrieval.  
Consequently the anomaly is unexplained.  Data are viewed as suspect, but 
they will remain in the dataset due to the inherent pattern of cyclicity for the 
following dates/times:
03/24/97  16:00  through 03/31/97 at 23:30

(c) Turbidity.  Negative values for turbidity observed throughout this month of 
data are considered suspect.  These observations will remain in the database 
until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, April 1997:
(a) Dissolved oxygen.  The same oscillatory phenomenon described for the March 
record at Big Marco Pass continues (see above).  Values oscillate around 
200%, and then abruptly drop to ~110% after the sonde swap on 04/14.  Data 
are interpreted as suspect, but will remain in the dataset for the following 
dates/times:
04/01/97  00:00 through 04/14/97  11:00

(b) Turbidity.  Negative values for turbidity observed throughout this month of 
data are considered suspect.  These observations will remain in the database 
until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, May 1997:
(a)	Turbidity.  Negative and high(>1000 NTU) values for turbidity observed 
throughout this month of data are considered suspect.  These observations will 
remain in the database until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, June 1997:
(a) Dissolved oxygen. An abrupt drop from 118% to 22% occurred and was 
followed by 10.5 hours of negative values.  Dissolved oxygen then returned to 
more normal, positive values, topping out at approximately 70%.  The record 
from 6/16 at 22:30 through the end of the sonde deployment on 6/25 at 10:30 
shows normal tidal oscillations but never regains values above ~75%.  When a 
fresh sonde was deployed at 11:00 on 6/25, values returned to over 100%.  
This behavior is unexplained.  The negative DO values(% sat and mg/l) were 
deleted from the dataset for the following dates/times: 
06/15/97  20:00 through 06/16/97  06:00

(b) Dissolved oxygen. The oxygen probe was damaged while deployed and was 
sent back to YSI for repairs.  DO data(% sat and mg/l)  for the following 
dates/times have been deleted from the dataset:
06/30/97  14:30 - 23:30

(c) Turbidity.  Negative values for turbidity observed throughout this month of 
data are considered suspect.  These observations will remain in the database 
until a decision is made on how to deal with such data.

Site #2: Big Marco Pass, July 1997:
(a) Dissolved oxygen.  DO values rose above 500% due to damage to the probe. 
All DO values(% sat and mg/l) will be deleted from the dataset for the 
following dates/times:
07/01/97  00:00 through 07/23/97  12:30
