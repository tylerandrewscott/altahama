Assessment SITEINFO	Contains information about sites used to develop the 2010 National Coastal Condition Assessment (i.e. Index sites) whether they were sampled or not.
NonAssessment SITEINFO	Contains information about sites that were NOT used to develop the 2010 National Coastal Condition Assessment. Sites may have been supplemental study sites or sites that were dropped and replaced with oversample sites.
