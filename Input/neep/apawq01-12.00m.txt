2. Entry verification:
YSI data are downloaded directly from the YSI 6000 into the PC6000 software, 
plotted, and initially analyzed for major anomalies and missing data.  Hydrolab 
data are downloaded from the Hydrolab Datasonde 3 to PCPLUS software.  Both YSI 
and Hydrolab raw data files are then downloaded as a comma delimited file (.cdf) 
and imported into Microsoft Excel as a comma-space delimited file (.csv).  These 
raw data files are then organized into standardized monthly data sets using the 
import.xls macros.   The import.xls macros generate a monthly spreadsheet, 
import the raw data, fill all empty cells with periods, change feet to meters 
for depth readings if necessary, and save the monthly files as either a .csv or 
.xls file.  Once in monthly format, these files are then run through the 
cdmomac(ro)3.xls macros which identify outliers, insure correct number of 
data points for each Date/Hour count, and format the columns in the correct 
order and size.  The monthly files are then carefully edited by staff for data 
anomalies which are identified in Section 10 (Data Anomalies) of this document.  
Any data that are deleted by staff are replaced with periods and identified in 
Section 11 (Missing Data) of this document.   Monthly edited files are then 
FTP'd to CDMO in text format, along with an updated metadata form. Lee Edmiston, 
Chip Bailey, Lauren Wright, and Christine Klassen are responsible for these 
tasks.

3. Research objectives:
The East Bay station collects water quality data associated with runoff from the 
Tates Hell Swamp area. This area was ditched, diked, and altered back in the 
late 1960's and early 1970's by timber companies.  It shortened the drainage 
period and allowed increased runoff with a concommittant increase in pH which 
had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  Because of this 
some plugs were put in to slow drainage, but little restoration work was done.  
A large section, approximately 36,000 acres, was purchased in 1994 by the 
Northwest Florida Water Management District.  An EPA grant allowed them to begin 
restoration of the site in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff.  Positioning 
the dataloggers at the surface and bottom in East Bay will allow the Reserve to 
monitor changes in water quality during this restoration effort. 




4. Research methods:
The YSI monitoring program was started in April 1995 in association with the 
NERRS national monitoring effort.  Prior to this, ANERR has been and continues 
to monitor three stations in the Apalachicola Bay system beginning in May 1992, 
using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's.  East Bay (bottom) is one of these stations and 
will be used in this monitoring program in addition to the YSI datalogger placed 
near the surface at this site. Both Hydrolab and YSI dataloggers are used at 
this station interchangeably as required.  

Prior to deployment, both the YSI 6000 and the Datasonde 3 are calibrated for 
conductivity, dissolved oxygen, depth, and pH following the procedures outlined 
in the YSI Operating and Service Manual (with addendum 7/94) and the Hydrolab 
Operating Manual, respectively.  Lab grade conductivity standards (Fisher Brand) 
are initially used to calibrate the YSI's, which are then used to check working 
standards made up and used for ongoing salinity calibration.  Lab grade 
standards are also used periodically to check the accuracy of the working 
salinity standards.  The only variation from the manual is the use of only one 
pH standard for one-point calibration of pH rather than three-point calibration.  
The membranes for the dissolved oxygen probe are installed at least 12 hours 
prior to calibration.  Depth is set to 0.0 meters in the lab.  A turbidity probe 
was added to the YSI 6000's in December 1996 and is calibrated using a lab grade 
(Fisher Brand) 40 NTU standard and deionized water (0 NTU).

Both YSI and Hydrolab dataloggers are deployed on the same piling within a five 
inch diameter stainless-steel tube with a locking cap.  In order to maintain 
constant depth, the dataloggers are clamped to a pvc pipe and lowered into the 
tube, relinquishing the need for diving.  Large holes were cut in the tube where 
the probes are located to insure adequate circulation.  Every two weeks the 
dataloggers are retrieved, downloaded, cleaned, and inspected.  Freshly 
calibrated units are deployed at the same time, resulting in little or no data 
gaps in the 30 minute collection intervals.

5. Site location and character:
The Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in the 
northwestern part of Florida, generally called the panhandle.  It is located 
adjacent to the City of Apalachicola, and encompasses most of the Apalachicola 
Bay system, including 52 miles of the lower Apalachicola River.  Passes, both 
natural and manmade, connect Apalachicola Bay to the northeastern Gulf of 
Mexico.  East Bay is separated from Apalachicola Bay by two bridges and a 
causeway and is located to the north of the bay proper.  The bay is 8.2 km long, 
has an average depth of approximately 1.0 m MHW, and an average width of 1.8 km. 
The tides in East Bay are mixed and range from 0.3 m to 1.0 m (average 0.5 m). 
The sampling site is located in the upper reaches of East Bay.  The piling 
location is latitude 29 47.15' N and longitude 84 52.52' W. At the sampling 
site, the depth is 2.2 m MHW and the width of the bay is 1 km.  The tides in the 
system are mixed, meaning the number of tides can range from one to five tides 
during a 24 hour period and are not evenly distributed throughout the day.  At 
the East Bay bottom site the meter probes are 0.3 m above the bottom sediment. 
Salinity ranges from 0 to 30 ppt and the long term average salinity is 
approximately 8 ppt.  At the East Bay surface site the meter probes are 1.7 m 
above the bottom sediment and salinity ranges from 0 ppt to 30 ppt with a long 
term average salinity of 6.3 ppt.  The freshwater input is very tanic and 
usually dark colored.  Flows vary with local rainfall and are not quantified due 
to the diverse sources of the runoff. The bottom habitat at this bay site is 
soft sediment, primarily silt and clay, with no vegetation present. The dominant 
marsh vegetation near the sampling site is Juncus roemerianus and Cladium 
jamaicense.  The dominant upland vegetation is primarily pineland forests which 
includes slash pine, saw palmetto, and sand pine.  Upland land use near the 
sampling site includes conservation and silviculture uses with some single 
family residential in the lower East Bay area.  The sampling site is influenced 
by local runoff from Tates Hell Swamp, the East Bay marshes, and distributary 
flow, some of which comes from the Apalachicola River via the East River.  
Tates Hell Swamp was ditched, diked, and altered back in the late 1960's and 
early 1970's by timber companies.  These changes shortened the drainage period 
and allowed increased runoff with a concomitant decrease in pH and increase in 
color, which had a drastic affect on the biological communities in East Bay.  
Restoration of Tates Hell Swamp began in 1995 to reduce non-point source runoff. 

6. Data collection period:
East Bay surface sampling with the YSI began on April 17, 1995.  East Bay bottom 
sampling began on May 1, 1995. Both continue through December 31 of this year.
A Hydrolab Datasonde 3 datalogger is occasionally deployed at times when an YSI 
datalogger is unavailable for deployment. During the year 2000, a Hydrolab was 
deployed at the East Bay Bottom station for the following dates/times:
01/01/00 00:00:00 through 02/10/00 12:00:00
All other East Bay Bottom and East Bay Surface deployments in 2000 utilized YSI 
dataloggers. 
	

7. Associated researchers and projects:
APA NERR has been using Hydrolab Datasonde 3's to monitor water quality at three 
stations in Apalachicola Bay since May of 1992.  One of these stations was moved 
from the mid-bay area near the Intracoastal Waterway to the East Bay bottom site 
in January of 1993.  The other two are located on two of the largest 
commercially important oyster bars in the bay.  These stations, like East Bay, 
are intended to be long-term. Other associated researchers and projects which 
have or continue to utilize this water quality data are:
