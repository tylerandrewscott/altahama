2.  Entry Verification:

	The data are uploaded directly from the YSI model 6000upg
dataloggers to the YSI PC6000 software into a file appended with the suffix
".dat". The data are also downloaded directly from the datalogger into a
spreadsheet importable file appended with the suffix ".csv". The data are
then reviewed for major problems (i.e. logger out of water, probe
malfunction, battery failure, etc.) using the YSI PC6000 plotting software.
The resulting plot is printed out  and saved in a folder named "datalogger
deployment log".  The .csv file is imported into Excel 5.0 for Macintosh,
where it is edited and formatted.
	The tails of each sampling period are deleted and any suspect data
are identified with the aid of Excel CDMO 5.0 macros.  Suspect data are
evaluated and dealt with according to CDMO Operations Manual (ver.3.0)
guidelines.  The parameter columns are checked for proper order and
formatted to the correct decimal places using the "column reformat" macro
supplied by the CDMO.  Missing data fields are inserted into the Excel
spreadsheet and are denoted by periods (.).  Reasons for any missing or
anomalous data are entered directly into the data file and the edited file
is saved as a two-week excel file.  When an entire month of two-week edited
data files have been collected, the files are edited and combined into a one
month excel file.   Dates and times when data were not collected are
entered directly into the excel file, along with a reason for the missing
data (from the deployment log).  All editing and missing data documentation
are also recorded in an excel file named "missing data log".  The
information in the "missing data log" is transferred to the metadata form.
The edited and raw files are archived on a Sun Sparc 20 workstation and
backed up to tape weekly.  Data and metadata files are uploaded via ftp to
the CDMO. The person responsible for the data management is Michelle
Cordrey.


3.  Research Objectives:

	The Tijuana Estuarine Research Reserve is impacted heavily by both
periodic raw sewage outflows and urban development. Only about a quarter of
the reserve's 2,531 acres are tidally influenced, with few channels deep
enough for datalogger deployment.  Two stations were originally set up:  a
treatment station was set up close to the mouth on the Southern end of
the Oneonta Slough, while a control station was set up on the northern
end of Oneonta Slough.  The treatment station location was chosen because
it would be the site most affected by sewage outflow. Deployment at the
treatment station, however, was continually halted by both shifting
sediment and massive wracks of kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), which would
often bury the deployment set-up on incoming tides.  After a number of
different deployment equipment designs were implemented, with no success,
logging at this site was terminated.
	We currently have three dataloggers installed at the reserve.  The
original control station in the northern end of Oneonta Slough is still
in place.  A second datalogger is installed at the Tidal Linkage site, a channel 
in the northeast section of the estuary that was dredged in 1997 to increase 
tidal flushing.  A third datalogger station is located at the inlet to the Model 
Marsh, a recently-constructeed 20-acre restoration site in the southern arm of 
the estuary.  The Tidal Linkage was opened to tidal flushing in the spring of 
1997, whereas the Model Marsh was opened in February 2000.  Installation of 
dataloggers at these two restoration sites will allow us to make comparisons 
between constructed and natural site hydrology over time.


4.  Research Methods (Dataloggers)

	A 4 inch diameter PVC pipe was strapped to a 6 ft length of steel
fencing post and driven into the sediment until refusal prior to datalogger
deployment in the center of the channel.  The bottom of the pipe is raised
one foot off of the channel bottom and is capped. Multiple 1.5" holes have been
drilled in the bottom  cap and sides to permit unrestricted flow to the
sensors.  The datalogger units are then placed into and rest on the bottom
of the tubes during deployment.  The sampling period is two weeks, with
measurements taken every 30 minutes.  Measurements for specific
conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (percent saturation), dissolved
oxygen (mg/l), temperature, turbidity and water level are recorded.  At the
end of each two week period, the YSI data logger unit  is replaced by
another YSI datalogger unit and brought back to the laboratory for
downloading, cleaning and recalibration. These procedures are carried out
according to the methods described in the YSI Operations Manual (see
sections 3 and 7). Calibration standards for specific conductivity, pH and
turbidity are purchased pre-made from VWR scientific.  The QA/QC procedures
for the collected data are followed as given in the CDMO Operations Manual
version 3.0.

	In May 1997 sampling at the Tidal Linkage station began.  All deployment, 
calibration and QA/QC procedures were followed exactly as they are at the 
Oneonta Slough station.

	Additionally, starting on May 23, 1997 plastic mesh sleeves were
placed on sondes at both stations to inhibit crabs from interfering with
the sensors.

	On October 25, 2000 logging began at the Model Marsh station.



5.  Site location and character
General site Characteristics (TJR)
a) Tidal exchange (extremes): approx. -2 +7 MLLW,
b) Salinity: 4 ppt (extreme rain events) to 38 ppt
d) Latitude and longitude:  32 deg. 34 min. N, 117 deg. 07 min. W
c) Potential impacts: storm drain runoff from military airfield and
adjacent residential areas, occasional sewage spills (10-15 MGD) into the
Tijuana River from Mexico.  The area surrounding the estuary is heavily
developed by residential housing as is the watershed which drains into the
estuary.  Approximately 2/3 of the watershed is in Mexico.  A military 
helicopter-training base borders the Northeastern section of the reserve.  
Vegetation in the area is dominated by common pickleweed (Spartina virginica) 
and Pacific cordgrass (Spartina foliosa).

Specific Site characteristics: Oneonta Slough (OS)
a) Orientation of site:  The Datalogger station is located on the upper portion 
of Oneonta Slough.  The channel runs north to south and is located on the 
northwestern edge of the reserve. Latitude is 32( 34' 04.8" N, longitude is 117( 
07' 52.3" W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom directly below the datalogger is
approx. -0.55m NGVD.
c) Channel width is approx. 20 meters.  Datalogger site is located 1km from 
mouth
d) Bottom type: sand and sediment
e) Area adjacent to west side of channel is developed. There is a 50-meter 
buffer of natural vegetation between development and the channel.  Area adjacent 
to east side of channel is relatively natural.
f) Direct impacts are estimated to be runoff from streets into channel during 
rain events.

Specific Site Characteristics: The Tidal Linkage (TL)
a) Orientation of site:  Datalogger station is located in the middle of the 
constructed channel known as the Tidal Linkage.  The channel runs northwest to 
Southwest and is located adjacent to the visitor's center in the northeastern 
section of the reserve. Latitude is 32 deg 34 min 24.9 sec N, longitude is 117 
deg 07 min 32.2 sec N.  In November of 1999 the datalogger site was moved 
approximately 180 meters northwest to a deeper section of the same channel.  The 
latitude of the new site is 32( 34' 27.9" N, the longitude is 117( 07' 37.8" W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom at the site prior to November 1999
is approximately -0.9m NGVD.
c) Channel width:  Approximately 5 meters at both the old and new sites
d) Bottom type: mostly mud at both old and new sites.

Specific Site Characteristics:  Model Marsh (MM)
a) Orientation of site: The datalogger station is located in the middle of a 
natural channel, which runs north to south.  The channel is approximately 20 
meters north of a newly constructed 20-acre mudflat restoration area in the 
southern section of the reserve.  The latitude of the site is 32( 32' 52.05" N, 
the longitude is 117( 07' 22.9" W.
b) The elevation of the channel bottom -.186m NGVD.
c) Channel width: 5 meters
d) Bottom type:  Mostly mud with some sand

7.  Associated researchers and projects

Sharook Madon (PERL) is using temperature data from the dataloggers in a
model to evaluate the value of marsh surface access in killi fish growth.
Greg Williams and Janelle West (PERL) are looking at shifts in fish and
invertebrate assemblages associated with the 1997 - 1998 El Nino event. The
Tidal Linkage channel is the ongoing site of research being conducted by PERL, 
which focuses on methods for increasing the success of saltmarsh re-vegetation 
projects.

12. Other Remarks/Notes:
Channel depth is very shallow at the Tidal Linkage site, so any minor freshwater 
inputs will result in large variation of salinity, even if depth does not 
reflect any significant rainfall. Events such as these are noted in metadata. 
Tidal Linkage also has severe sedimentation problems preventing in the datasonde 
from being deployed.  This occurred throughout the year and was discontinued 
from August through the rest of the year.
