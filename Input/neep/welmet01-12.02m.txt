2)  Entry verification:

a) Data Input Procedures
	
	The 15-minute, 1-hour average, and 24-hour meteorological data 
were downloaded from each instrument on the weather station to a 
Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger. The CDMO Data Logger Program was 
loaded into the CR10X and controls the sensors and data collection 
schedule (see 2b of the Entry Verification section for the data 
collection schedule). The CR10X then interfaced with the PC208W 
software supplied by Campbell Scientific. This software was located on 
a computer to which the data was uploaded (every 15 minutes) via a 
short haul modem to a computer located at the Coastal Ecology Center.  
The data was saved as a raw data file (LF_RAW.dat) onto a separate hard 
drive and backed up.

	Once an entire month of data was available, the CDMO Weather 
Data Management Program (WDMP) was used to convert the files to an 
Access database.  This program was developed in Visual Basic to 
interface with the NERRS data collection schedule (see 2b of the Entry 
Verification section for the data collection schedule).  The WDMP will 
automatically input and convert the monthly raw data file into and 
Access Database.  There are three main steps the WDMP performs.  First, 
it converts the comma delimited monthly raw data file into an Access 
Database.  Secondly, it checks the data against a predetermined set of 
error criteria (see Part C of this section).  Finally, it produces 
error and summary reports. Any anomalous data were investigated and are 
noted below in Anomalous Data section.  Any data corrections that were 
performed are noted in the Data Correction section below.
  
	Common errors noted in the monthly error reports were wind 
speeds below the 0.5 m/s criteria, temperature change of greater than 3 
C in a 15 minute period, and relative humidity change of greater than 
25% in a 15 minute period.  All errors of these types were double 
checked with other data that could support such "anomalous" weather 
changes and noted in the sections that follow. Both raw data files and 
Access databases were saved to the DCP server with daily tape back-up. 

	Jim Dochtermann error checked and compiled the 2002 weather 
data.

The Centralized Data Management Office converted all SWMP weather data 
collected with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was 
distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the 
old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums 
every fifteen minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day 
(array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 
and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   the hourly 
101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, 
the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing 
data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP 
weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed 
and left blank.

3) Research Objectives
	The principal objective is to record long-term meteorological 
data for Wells, in order to supplement SWMP water quality YSI data and 
research data, and to observe any environmental changes or trends over 
time. 

4) Research Methods

	The Campbell Scientific weather station (CR10X datalogger) is 
programmed to measure parameters every 5 seconds to produce both hourly 
and daily averages of measurements, including air temperature, relative 
humidity, barometric pressure, LiCor (solar radiation), rainfall, wind 
speed and wind direction.  An instantaneous sample is taken every 15 
minutes and that data is stored in array 150. Data are downloaded to a 
desktop computer from the datalogger via the SC32A interface.  On-site 
weather conditions are measured to verify the accuracy of the readings 
by the sensors.  Sensors on the weather station are inspected for 
damage or debris periodically. Sensors are sent back to Campbell 
Scientific for calibration at a minimum of every two years. 

	The data is analyzed using the Weather Data Management Program 
where a database and error report is create for each month from the raw 
data files. The error reports are used to assist in the QA/QC of the 
data. Data is then edited in Access and recompiled in the WDMP. All 
edits and errors are documented in the metadata. 

5) Site location and character    

	The Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve is located in York 
County, within the Town of Wells, on the coast of southern Maine and 
faces the Atlantic Ocean.  The Wells NERR is approximately 31 km (20 
miles) south of Portland, Maine and 110 km (70 miles) north of Boston, 
Massachusetts.  The Reserve encompasses 1,690 acres along the Gulf of 
Maine coastline of tidally flushed wetlands, riparian and transitional 
upland fields and forests within the Little River Estuary and the 
larger Webhannet River Estuary.  Both estuaries arise in the sandy 
glacial outwash plain about eight miles inland.  Both rivers empty 
into Wells Bay, a sandy basin stretching for approximately ten miles 
along the Atlantic coast.  Bordering each river's inlet are double spit 
barrier beaches attached to the mainland.  The backbarrier system is 
approximately 5 sq. km and is composed of large intertidal marshes 
(predominantly S. patens and S. alterniflora), intertidal sand and mud 
flats, and tidal channels.  The watershed for the Webhannet River 
estuary covers an area of 35 sq. km and has a total of 6 streams, 
brooks or creeks, which enter the estuary.  These tributaries flow 
across sand and gravel deposits near the headwaters and the impermeable 
sandy mud of the Presumpscot Formation in the lower reaches.  The 
Webhannet River is connected to the ocean via Wells Inlet, which has a 
spring tidal prism of 28,200,000 cub. m (Ward 1993). The force and 
volume of tidal action affect the salinity level of both rivers.  In 
the Wells region, the annual mean wave height is almost 20 inches.  The 
estuarine system is dominated by semi-diurnal tides having a range of 
8.5 to 9.8 feet.  The volume of freshwater influx into both estuaries 
is moderate to low (on the order of 0.5 cubic meters/second), 
especially in the summer, because of the rivers' relatively small 
drainage areas and the presence of deep glacial deposits.  The 
relatively low flows from these two rivers taken in with the 20 inch 
per year average runoff of the area surrounding the estuaries combine 
to form a freshwater flow that is dwarfed by tidal flushing.  Twelve-
foot tides dwarf the freshwater flow into the Webhannet estuary, which 
has a drainage area of 14.1 square miles.  The Webhannet estuary, fed 
by both Blacksmith and Depot Brooks, is adjacent to the harbor and 
greatly developed land.  It offers a valuable opportunity for 
comparison with the relatively pristine Little River estuary.  The land 
use of the Webhannet estuary include a total of 15% for wetland, fresh 
water, and tidal marsh; a total of 63.7 % for woodland; and a total of 
18.6% for developed land (compared to a total of 5.7% development in 
the Little River estuary) (WNERR RMA 1996; Holden 1997).

	The following information regarding annual weather patterns in 
the area was supplied by Maine State Climatologist Professor Gregory A. 
Zielinski extracted from "Monthly Station Normals of Temperature,Precipitation, 
Heating and Cooling Degree Days 1971-2000", Climatography of the United 
States No. 81, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National 
Climatic Data Center, Asheville, NC. and "Daily Normals of Temperature, 
Precipitation, and Heating and Cooling Degree Days, 1971-2000", Climatography 
of the United States No. 84: "Average monthly temperatures range from 21.6F 
in January to 66.7F in July with daily highs averaging just below freezing 
in January and lows around 11F. Daily highs in July average around 76F and 
daily lows around 57F. The sea breeze often keeps daily highs lower during 
the summer than areas inland. Annual average temperature is 44.6F. Annual 
precipitation is 47.07 inches, including the water equivalent of snowfall, 
with monthly averages ranging from 3.01 inches in July to 4.77 inches in 
October. August receives just 3.02 inches on average. Annual snowfall is 
around 66 inches." According to Zielinski, "cool ocean temperatures keep 
down the number of afternoon showers and especially thunderstorms resulting 
in low summer precipitation amounts." 

	The weather station is located (43 deg 20.244 Latitude, 70 deg 
33.000 Longitude) on a 32' telephone pole surrounded by mowed grass.  
The temperature and humidity probes are located on the north side of 
the pole at a height of 10'. To the NW of the pole is the Coastal 
Ecology Center, a 20' high, 111' long building, at a distance of 37', 
running NE/SW.  Further to the NW (153' from the pole) is the library, 
in a 25' high wing of the barn.  The barn itself is 223' from the 
station and runs NE/SW.  It is 38' high and is the largest obstruction 
in the area.  The rain gauge is located 9' southeast of the weather 
station pole and is situated on a post with the top of the funnel is 
10' from the ground. 

	There are three SWMP water quality sampling sites in the Webhannet 
River estuary. These are located at the Head of Tide, Mile Road, and at the 
Inlet. The tidal range at each of these sites is 2.6-2.9 meters.   

	The Head of Tide site is located 4 miles south of the Wells Reserve, just 
downstream of the Webhannet Falls (freshwater) and 10 feet east of Route One (43 
deg 17' 54.25227" Latitude, 70 deg 35' 13.82728" Longitude).  Route One is used 
heavily with traffic all year, especially during the summer tourist months.  
This site has soft mud, sand, and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide 
depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is 0-31 ppt, with a mean 
of 3.6 ppt.  These headwaters of the Webhannet are relatively undeveloped.  
This site is located just 10 feet east of the Route One bridge, and is our 
roving site.

	The Mile Road site is located 3.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, on Mile 
Road roughly 300' north of the bridge (N43 deg 18.300' Latitude,W 70 deg 34.583 
Longitude). This site has soft mud and a rocky substrate, and the low and high tide 
depth is relatively shallow.  The salinity range here is  3.6-33.4 ppt, with a mean 
of  27.0 ppt.

	The Inlet site is located 1.5 miles south of the Wells Reserve, at the 
Wells Harbor pier (43 deg 19' 12.44804" Latitude, 70 deg 33' 13.82728" 
Longitude).  The mouth of the Webhannet estuary forms an extensive wetland/salt 
marsh area which is surrounded by development.  Wells Harbor, which was most 
recently dredged in 1971, has moorings for approximately 200 commercial fishing 
and recreational boats.  The mouth of the river flows between two jetties to the 
Atlantic Ocean.  This channel was dredged in 1974.  This site has a 
predominately sand substrate and is characterized by strong current during 
incoming and outgoing tides.  The maximum depth of the Inlet site is 3 meters. The 
salinity range here is 7-35 ppt, with a mean of 31 ppt.  The Inlet site is heavily 
impacted at the Wells Harbor dock and is our long-term monitoring site.

	There is one SWMP water quality sampling site located at the Little River Mouth 
site .4 miles east of the Wells Reserve. Due to problems with heavy sediment 
movement in the inlet of the Little River, we were forced to relocate the site 
(see Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes). The first location (N 43 deg 20.176 Latitude, W 70 deg 
32.497 Longitude) was located in the main channel of the river, just inland of a spit, 
beside a bank. The second location (N 43 deg 20.083 Latitude, W 70 deg 32.585 Longitude) 
was located 1/8 mi. southwest of the first site, within an inlet, just inland of a spit. 
The second site was located in an area of much lower current than the first site and often 
drains completely during low tides. It was also placed within a pool next to incipient 
low marsh peat that retains calm water during low tides. Both sites were abandoned (see 
Sec 14-Other Remarks/Notes).

6) Data collection period
Weather data has been collected at the Wells NERR since December 1996. 
Data was collected for the entire year in 2002.

8) Associated researchers and projects

WELLS NATIONAL ESTUARINE RESEARCH RESERVE RESEARCH AT THE RESERVE for 
2002(Please visit our website: www.wellsreserve.org/research.htm for 
further information on the Wells NERR research program):

The Research Program at the Wells NERR conducts and supports research, 
monitoring, workshops, and research/resource management planning of 
relevance at local, regional and national levels.  The overall aim of 
our work is to produce science-based information needed to sustain or 
restore Gulf of Maine coastal habitats and resources, especially those 
found in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds.  During 2000-2001 twenty-
three different studies (involving 79 scientists, students, and staff  
from the Reserve, 26 academic institutions and 19 resource management 
groups) focused on several related themes:1) the quality of water 
resources  in salt marsh estuaries and watersheds 2) land conservation 
strategies to protect coastal watersheds 3) factors controlling salt 
marsh accretion, erosion and plant community vigor 4) the value of salt 
marsh as habitat for fish, shellfish and birds,  and 5) restoration of 
salt marsh habitat degraded through human actions.

Estuarine Water Resource Quality

Water quality is monitored continuously at several stations with 
automated instruments as part of a NERRS systemwide monitoring program, 
as well as bimonthly at 15-20 stations through our WET volunteer 
monitoring program.  The WET program also monitors two important 
biological parameters: fecal coliform bacterial contamination (an 
indicator of human health risk) and phytoplankton productivity (an 
indicator of estuarine health).  These data have 1) allowed us 
to identify several bacterial "hot spots" that we will be working to 
eliminate, 2) are used to identify and open areas safe for 
shellfishing, and 3) have uncovered a relation between tides and low 
dissolved oxygen (a stressful condition for marine life) that needs 
further study.  Our water quality work has contributed to the 
designation of several Priority Watersheds in coastal Southern Maine by 
the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 

Coastal Conservation Strategies

In response to requests for support from the conservation community to 
increase the quantity, quality and ecological integrity of conserved 
lands in our region research staff organize and facilitate meetings, 
workshops, and communications for 18 partner conservation groups.  A 
key element of the Project is the Conservation Resource Center, a 
Reserve staffed GIS facility with a growing database able to provide 
maps of property, natural features and other data needed to develop 
effective conservation goals and strategies.  The Project is nearing 
completion of conservation lands maps for 13 Southern Maine coastal 
towns, and is undertaking an initiative to develop coastal watershed 
conservation strategies for 12 coastal watersheds within these towns.  
The Reserve has a particular interest in educating communities about 
the ecologic and economic benefits of land conservation, especially 
along estuarine and riverine shorelines.

Salt Marsh Habitats and Communities

Factors that control the dynamics and vigor of salt marsh plant 
communities and marsh peat formation consequently determine the ability 
of a salt marsh to persist in the face of sea level rise.  Through a 
combination of experimental manipulations and long term monitoring, a 
number of multi-year studies are currently producing data to answer 
questions concerning the sustainability of salt marsh habitats in this 
region.  These studies are looking at nutrient-plant relations, plant 
community responses to physical and hydrologic disturbance, and the 
relative contribution of short-term natural events (e.g. storms) and 
human activities (dredging, tidal restriction) on patterns of sediment 
accretion and erosion.  The Reserve's marshes and beaches are already 
among the best studied sites in the U.S. with regard to long term 
accretion and erosion (over thousands of years).

HABITAT VALUE FOR FISH, SHELLFISH AND BIRDS

The Reserve combines long-term monitoring with periodic surveys and 
short-term experiments to identify species and measure trends and 
changes in populations of fish, crustaceans, clams and birds.   We have 
10 years of data on upland and shore birds with which to assess the 
status of resident and migratory avian populations, and 8 years of 
wading bird data that we use as a gross level indicator of salt marsh 
health, which appears to be stable.  Our periodic larval, juvenile and 
adult fish surveys have produced the best available data for fish 
utilization of salt marsh estuaries in the Gulf of Maine. In the 
coming year we plan to develop a long-term monitoring program for 
finfish that will be coordinated with other sites within the Gulf of 
Maine and along the east coast.  Since 1994 we have been conducting 
surveys and field experiments to look at the survival and growth of 
hatchery seed, juvenile and adult softshell clam with regard to habitat 
characteristics and predation by the invasive green crab.

Salt Marsh Degradation and Restoration

 Salt marsh ecosystems in the Gulf of Maine have sustained themselves 
in the face of sea-level rise and other natural disturbances for nearly 
five thousand years.  Since colonial times large areas of salt marsh 
(up to half of the total area) have been lost through diking, draining 
and filling.  Today, the remaining marshland is fairly well protected 
from outright destruction, but during the past 100 years, and 
especially since the 1950's, salt marshes have been divided into 
fragments by roads, causeways, culverts and tide gates.  Most of these 
fragments have severely restricted tidal flow, leading to chronic 
habitat degradation and greatly reduced access for fish and other 
marine species.  Since 1991, the Wells Reserve has been studying the 
impact of these restrictions on salt marsh functions and values, and 
the response of salt marshes to tidal restoration.  We have been 
working to promote an awareness of the damage being done and the 
benefits of salt marsh restoration throughout the Gulf of Maine.

Research Program Update:
In addition to the Reserve-sponsored projects outlined above, numerous 
visiting investigators will be involved in on-site research.  Topics 
include: the effects of land use, sea level, and climate on estuarine 
productivity; the relationship between soil nutrients and plant 
community patterns; the influence of soil salinity on plant community 
interactions; the effect of tidal restriction on marsh peat accretion; 
the comparative ecology of fringe marshes and back barrier marshes; 
habitat use by upland birds, and the ecology of lyme disease.

• The Wells NERR Research Dept. is working on the following projects:  
"Ecological processes, energy pathways, and the impact of human 
activities on Maine marsh-estuarine secondary production: a salt marsh 
panne model". We used stable isotopic tracers (15N additions and 
naturally abundant 13C) coupled with secondary production measurements 
(nekton, invertebrates) to track energy flow on the high marsh surface 
in southern Maine salt marsh systems. The project is still under way.

"Ecological Functions of Fringing Salt Marshes Susceptible to Oil 
Spills 
in Casco Bay, Maine". We examined the ecological function of 9 
different 
fringing marsh systems in Casco Bay that ranged from undisturbed to 
disturbed. Physical parameters measured included sedimentation rates, 
total suspended solids, and tidal range. Biological parameters included 
primary production, macroinvertebrate community composition and 
secondary production (4cm sediment cores), and resident and transient 
nekton community composition (fyke net). The project is still under 
way.

"BENTHIC HABITAT CORRELATES OF JUVENILE FISH DISTRIBUTION IN THE 
BIGELOW BIGHT AND ADJACENT ESTUARIES: LINKAGES BETWEEN FISH, HABITATS, 
SUBSTRATE AND HUMAN ACTIVITY". This project was a collaboration between the Wells 
N.E.R.R. and several members of the local fishing community. Through 
the 
use of beam trawls, gill nets, fish traps, van veen ponar, and a 
sediment profile imager (SPI camera), we are attempting to correlate 
benthic habitat type to juvenile groundfish an dinvertebrate assemblages 
in estuarine, nearshore, and offshore habitat. Stations were also 
established near dredge spoil dump sites as well as sweage outflow to 
determine the impacts of human activity on the coast to benthic 
habitat. The project is still under way.

• The Wells NERR Research Dept. also completed the work on the 
following project: 
In partnership with the York Rivers Association and the Town of York, 
the Wells Reserve conducted a survey of the York River watershed.  In 
this survey, volunteers looked for sources of pollution within a 250-
foot buffer of the river and its tributaries (erosion, trash and debris 
and runoff from roads and lawns could have a negative impact on water 
quality).  Most pollutants entering water bodies come from such 
undefined sources.  Therefore, this type of survey is the best way to 
begin to address the problems of pollution in a water body.  The idea 
of the project was to work with the community and landowners to help 
them understand the problems that come from these types of pollution 
and learn activities they might be able to do on their own land that 
would help prevent this pollution from entering the water.  The results 
of the survey will become part of a Watershed Management Plan to 
improve and restore the water quality of the York River.

•The Wells NERR Research Dept. is involved with the following CICEET 
Projects (information on CICEET can be found on the website 
http://www.ciceet.unh.edu):

I. Project Title: Estuarine Responses to Dredging: Analysis of 
Sedimentary and Morphological Change in Back Barrier Marsh to Aid Local 
Management and Develop a Regional Management Tool Principal 
Investigator (s): Michele Dionne, Wells NERR, ME; Duncan Fitzgerald, 
Boston University; Joe Kelley, University of Maine; David 
Burdick and Larry Ward, University of New Hampshire

Management Issue: Coastal management tool for assessing the impacts of 
dredging in estuaries. Project Summary: An adequate supply of sediment 
is essential for maintaining salt marshes.  Human activities, such as 
channel dredging and tidal restriction due to road construction, can 
alter water flows in estuaries and result in dramatic changes in salt 
marsh sediment supply, affecting the speed of salt marsh erosion.  The 
objective of this project is to determine the impact of dredging and 
tidal restriction on salt marshes in the Wells NERR.  A digital 
coastal management guide will be created on CD ROM, providing coastal 
managers with useful conceptual models for predicting the impacts of 
dredging and other activities that affect water flow and sediment 
deposition in salt marshes.

II. Project Title: Microbial Source Tracking in Two Southern Maine 
Watersheds. A two year project written by Maine Sea Grant associate 
Kristen Whiting-Grant, and funded by Cooperative Institute for Coastal 
and Estuarine Environmental Technology (CICEET), involving Wells NERR,
UNH Jackson Estuarine Lab (JEL), USM Muskie School, AmeriCorps and the 
Maine Conservation Corps. We are pioneering the use in
Maine of genetic analysis as a means of determining the source species 
associated with bacterial contamination in the Webhannet and
Little River Estuary. Volunteers collect water samples from streams and 
the estuaries, staff test for and isolate E. coli. At JEL, a genetic
technique (ribotyping) creates a genetic fingerprint of the bacteria 
which is compared to known sources. The project is still underway.

collected with CR10X program versions prior to version 4.0 which was 
distributed in October 2003.  This was necessary in order to merge the 
old data format (12 array output) with the new data format found in version 4.0
(3 array output).  The new format produces averages, maximums and minimums 
every fifteen minutes (array 15), every hour (array 60) and every day 
(array 144) for any sensors hooked up to the CR10X.   Specifically, the 150 
and 151 fifteen minute data were converted to the new 15 array;   the hourly 
101, 102, 105 and 106 data were converted to the new 60 array; and the daily 241, 242, 
243, 244, 245 and 246 data were converted to the new 144 array.  With the new format, 
the use of 55555's to code for deleted data and 11111's to code for missing 
data has been abandoned.  Hence, all 55555's or 11111's contained in the SWMP 
weather data collected prior to Version 4.0 of the CR10X program were removed 
and left blank.  


LiCor:  
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values less 
than 0 were altered in the raw data to read 0. These values may indicate an incorrect 
multiplier, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction. Because these values are 
changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.

Relative Humidity:
Prior to the installation of the new NERR_4.CSI program, all values over 
100% were altered in the raw data to read 100%.  These values may indicate super 
saturated air, calibration problems, or a sensor malfunction.  Because these values 
are changed in the raw data, we cannot confirm that they are all valid data points.
