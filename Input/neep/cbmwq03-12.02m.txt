2. Entry verification
Raw data were uploaded from the YSI 6000UPG and YSI 6600 data loggers to a PC, 
graphs were produced and data were visually examined after each deployment using 
the EcoWatch software. Data files were then exported from the EcoWatch format 
into Excel (for Windows 2000) files, where the headers, footers, and 
inappropriate spaces were removed.  Raw data was archived, plotted and suspect 
data (outliers) or trends noted initially to verify accurate instrument 
operation for service as needed prior to redeployment.  Janet Barnes and Ned 
Burger were responsible for these tasks.

Data from each deployment was processed initially using macros in the CDMO 
cdmomac3.xls program.  Steps in the program include procedures which allow users 
to automatically format column widths to the correct number of decimal places 
based on YSI sensor specifications.  It also allows users to QA/QC each data 
logger generated file for missing data points, fill all cells that do not 
contain data with periods, and find all data points that fall outside the range 
of what the data logger is designed to measure (outliers). The CDMO import.xls 
macro allows PC users with 30-minute data to automatically create a monthly 
Excel file from a two-week deployment and insert periods for missing data. In 
addition, in November 1999 a graphing capability was added to this macro 
allowing users to produce single parameter and missing data point graphs on a 
monthly basis.

Raw data from successive deployments were merged using the CDMO import.xls 
macros to produce monthly files.  Resulting monthly Excel files at each site 
(eg. JB0302.xls) consist of continuous data for all variables measured, with a 
period (.) to denote any missing data.  At this point, these data have not been 
modified except for replacement of missing entries with a period. Data were then 
processed using the CDMO cdmomac3.xls macros as an initial step in QA/QC
procedures to identify outliers, defined simply as values outside the respective 
sensor specifications.  Results are retained as monthly Excel files for each 
site (eg. JB0302outliers.xls). 

The final data processing involved identification and documentation of data 
points judged to be anomalous (suspect) or erroneous due to extreme natural 
events or equipment malfunctions using various procedures including 
recommendations from CDMO Operations Manual Appendix B, YSI 6000 Data Review and 
Editing Protocol.  Anomalous data were retained in cases where no definite 
reason for deletion was found.  Periods during which data were found to result 
from equipment malfunctions, failure, tampering or exposure to air by low tides 
were identified, times with causes or related observations documented below and 
respective data removed or deleted. These resulting edited data and 
documentation (metadata) were archived, formatted in comma delimited file format 
and submitted to the CDMO for further QA/QC.  Ned Burger was responsible for 
these tasks.

3. Research Objectives        
The purpose of the monitoring program at CBM NERR is to conform to the NERR SWMP 
monitoring program looking at trends in water quality over both temporal and 
spatial scales. Observed effects of water quality, habitats and living resources 
in the river channel site and the nearby emergent tidal fresh marshes are being 
studied using various comparative field sampling methods with the backdrop of 
long term high resolution data from two representative fixed monitoring sites.  
Water quality measurements were taken every 30 minutes from 19 March through 16 
December 2002 at both the Patuxent River Park (PR) and Jug Bay Wetlands 
Sanctuary (JB) sites that conform to seasonal measurements collected each year 
since 1995.

4. Research methods (YSI data loggers)

Data loggers and methods of deployments were replaced and upgraded during 2002 
after tests of existing YSI 6000 data loggers and consultation with YSI 
technicians determined new data loggers with upgraded sensor packages to be 
more cost effective.   Existing YSI 6000 instruments, some with failing or 
missing components, were initially deployed from March through August, when 
replacement dataloggers were received and put into service.  Deployment methods 
conformed with those initiated in 1995, placing each data logger inside a 4" 
diameter PVC pipe that was cut in half to expose the sensors.  The PVC sleeve 
was suspended inside a galvanized wire crab pot or muskrat trap using rubber 
shock cords to position dataloggers horizontally with sensors 6 - 10 
centimeters above the channel bottom.  At each site, the enclosure was locked 
to a pier.  Measurements for temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, 
percent oxygen saturation, dissolved oxygen, water level, pH and turbidity were 
recorded every 30 minutes.  After deployments ranging from one to three weeks, 
depending on biofouling intensity (temperature dependent), data loggers were 
replaced with newly serviced instruments.  Post deployment data was collected, 
data downloaded, archived, then examined visually.  Efforts were made to relate 
sensor conditions to any apparent outliers or anomalies (eg. battery charge 
status, or normal DO data at the beginning of a deployment may be distinguished 
from erroneous data resulting from a known malfunction, such as a punctured DO 
membrane due to crabs).  Data loggers and sensors were cleaned, serviced and 
calibrated according to the methods described in the YSI Operating Manual and 
SWMP Operating Procedures.  Laboratory calibration procedures were carried out 
in accordance with the YSI operating manual methods.  Standards for pH, 
conductivity and turbidity were purchased from YSI.  Data were reviewed and 
edited according to the YSI Data Review and Editing Protocol in Appendix B of 
the CDMO manual.  After cleaning the data loggers, the dissolved oxygen (DO) 
membrane were replaced and allowed to stretch for 24 hours before calibration 
begins. The pH, conductivity, depth, and turbidity sensors were calibrated, 
using the following standards: 2-point pH 4 and 7, conductivity standard of 
1.000 mS/cm, depth in the air, and 2-point turbidity standards of 0 (distilled 
water) and 100 NTU for the 6026 turbidity sensor on the old YSI 6000 sondes; 
123 NTU for the 6136 turbidity probe on the new 6600 EDS sondes first deployed 
23 August 2003.  The DO sensor was calibrated in air following YSI procedures.  
Several quality assurance checks were used to determine if the sensor readings 
drifted significantly during deployment.  Post-deployment measurements of all 
the parameters except turbidity were recorded before cleaning the data loggers. 
Sensors were immersed in the appropriate standard solutions (i.e., pH) and 
readings recorded.  Turbidity was post calibrated after the sonde was cleaned 
to insure the accuracy of the standard.

5. Site location and character
The Chesapeake Bay Maryland NERR has three components in Maryland's portion of 
Chesapeake Bay.  Monie Bay is a mesohaline region on the lower Eastern Shore; 
Otter Point Creek is a tidal freshwater river and marsh system; and Jug Bay is 
part of the freshwater portion of the Patuxent River.  Both data loggers during 
2002 were  within the Jug Bay component.

     Patuxent River Park (PR) 38 deg 46' 23.5" N, 76 deg 42' 32.5" W 
Site PR is located in the upper tidal headwaters of the Patuxent River, 
Maryland. PR is along the mainstem of the Patuxent River, which is approximately 
50m wide at this point along the river.  The PR site sits adjacent to a boat 
launch at Jackson Landing, located on the Prince Georges County side of the 
river at Patuxent River Park.  The actual sonde was deployed horizontally in a 
retro-fitted crab pot and sits roughly .25m off the bottom sediments.  In 
October 2002, the sonde was placed vertically in a perforated PVC pipe for 
easier access and protection. Sediments at the site are extremely fine and 
easily resuspended.  Average depth at this site is roughly 2 meters.  Salinities 
at this site rarely exceed 1ppt.  Because this site is located along the main 
channel of the Patuxent River, water quality at this site represents the general 
quality of water flowing along the main portion of the river.  The Patuxent 
River watershed is an increasingly urbanized watershed, however there are 
extensive riparian buffers along the portion of the river that flows through the 
site.  However, the PR site is approximately 3km downstream of a large 
wastewater treatment plant that discharges directly into the Western Branch 
tributary of the Patuxent River.   The PR site is roughly 1.5km downstream of 
the confluence of the Western Branch tributary and the Patuxent River mainstem.  
The tidal range at this site is roughly 0.5m.

     Jug Bay (JB) 38 deg 46' 50.6" N, 76 deg 42' 29.1" W 
Site JB is located in a shallow tidal creek adjacent to the Patuxent River.  The 
site is slightly upstream (roughly 0.3km) from the PR site but sits in a shallow 
creek that is tidally infiltrated by a backwater marsh  adjacent to the Patuxent 
River mainstem.  At low tide, this backwater marsh becomes a large mud flat with 
very little standing water.  The creek ranges in width between 2m to 5m at the 
site and average depth at the site is 0.75m.  Because of the shallow nature of 
this site, the sonde is periodically exposed at very low tides.  Sediments at 
this site are extremely fine and flocculant.  The sonde is deployed horizontally 
in a retro-fitted cage, similar to site PR.  Because of the shallowness of the 
tidal creek, coupled with the dramatic daily changes in the depth and width of 
the stream, deployments at this site have presented some problems.  These 
problems include periodic exposure of the sonde, very high turbidity and 
sedimentation rates associated with tidal infiltration and resuspension, which 
have caused severe fouling of the probes at this site. Water quality at the site 
represents extreme shallow water habitats.  Thus it is not uncommon to see very     
large fluctuations in temperature and dissolved oxygen at this site ranging from 
complete anoxia to full saturation, due in part to the shallow nature of the 
site and the effects of marsh processes on water quality.  Salinities at this 
site rarely exceed 1 ppt.  Tidal range at this site is roughly 0.5m.

6. Data collection period
Data collection using sondes at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary (JB) and Patuxent 
River Park (PR) did not begin until March 19, 2002 and continued through December 16, 2002.  
Because instruments can be trapped and damaged by ice formation in the lower salinity and upper 
Chesapeake Bay tributaries, which occurs periodically from November through March, 
deployments have been limited to ice-free months, therefore data is not available for 
January and February 2002 due to ice cover.

11. Data anomalies (suspect data)
Any data outliers detected using CDMO macros and any data deletions are detailed 
below. Suspect and outlier data were detected and considered for deletion from 
the edited data using combination of methods, including graphics and CDMO 
macros.  All outliers are detailed below. Any data determined to be due to 
instrument errors or malfunctions were retained in raw data. Missing data and 
any intended deletions from edited data were replaced with a period (.) in
accordance with CDMO QA/QC guidelines and detailed below. According to the CDMO
Operations Manual Version 3.0, depth measurements taken with the non-vented 
level probe can be influenced by up to 0.39 m (1.3 ft) during some low-pressure 
hurricane events.  Specific dates and time ranges of potentially influenced data 
are listed with each respective month.


Jug Bay
Sonde deployment at the Jug Bay site began 3/19/02 at 15:30:00.  Positioning the 
muskrat trap that housed the sonde deployed adjacent to the weather station dock 
was problematic due to limited total water depth in the marsh inlet.  After the 
first week of deployment, the sonde was observed out of the water on retrieval 
25 March at low tide (mean tide range 1.9 meter). 

Consequently, a pole was used in all subsequent deployments to reposition the 
trap in the deepest point of the channel.  Although the fresh tidal 
characteristics of this site made detection of sonde exposure difficult, unusual 
coinciding patterns in specific conductivity (*observations < 0.01 detailed 
below), dissolved oxygen and low depth measurements indicate that there were 
periodic observations throughout the year during extremely low tides that the 
sonde was out of the water which affected all variables measured, noted below.  
Typical patterns were resumed as tidal heights increased.  Due to lack of 
turbidity sensors on the YSI 6000 instruments, there were no turbidity 
observations at Jug Bay from 3/19/2002 through 8/23/2002 10:30.  The new YSI 
6600 put into service at 11:00 on 8/23/2002 included a full suite of sensors 
which included turbidity.

The lowest water levels of the 2002 field season were observed at low tides from 
May 11 through May 15, which may have temporarily exposed sensors to air in at 
the shallow Jug Bay site.

Deployment for this site for 2002 ended December 16 @ 17:30:00. 


Patuxent River Park
The sonde was deployed at the Patuxent River Park site beginning 3/19/02 at 
17:00:00 adjacent to the floating dock used by Park staff.  The YSI 6000 
instrument was fastened horizontally inside a weighted crab pot with sensors 
positioned 6 inches above the bottom sediments in 5 feet of water (MLW).  This 
deployment method was replaced on 27 October 2002 with a protective PVC pipe
enclosure affixed vertically to the dock piling for protection and security.  
The 4-inch diameter stand-pipe enclosure was abundantly perforated with 5.1 cm 
diameter holes to allow water to circulate freely, followed by dewaxing and 
applications of underwater bonding and ablative anti- fouling paint to resist 
marine biofouling.  Only one of the two YSI 6000 instruments deployed at
the Patuxent River Park site was equipped with a turbidity sensor, therefore 
turbidity measurements were present on alternating deployments from 3/19/2002 
through 8/23/2002 at 09:30.  The new YSI 6600's put into service at 10:00 on 
8/23/2002 included a full suite of sensors which included turbidity.

12) Missing data
Missing data are denoted by a period in the data set.  Data are missing due to 
equipment failure where no probes were deployed, maintenance/calibration of 
equipment, elimination of obvious outliers or elimination of data due to 
calibration problems (both pre and post).  For more details on deleted data, see 
the Data Anomalies Section.  To find out more details about missing data, 
contact the Research Coordinator at the site submitting the data.

Jug Bay
Due to lack of turbidity sensors on the YSI 6000 instruments, there were no turbidity 
observations at Jug Bay from 3/19/2002 through 8/23/2002 10:30.  The new YSI 
6600 put into service at 11:00 on 8/23/2002 included a full suite of sensors 
which included turbidity.

Patuxent River Park
Only one of the two YSI 6000 instruments deployed at the Patuxent River Park site 
was equipped with a turbidity sensor, therefore turbidity measurements were present 
on alternating deployments from 3/19/2002 through 8/23/2002 at 09:30.  The new YSI 
6600's put into service at 10:00 on 8/23/2002 included a full suite of sensors which
included turbidity.
